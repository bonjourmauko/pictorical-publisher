They&#10;had hastened to bring forth flowers before they got green leaves,&#10;and in the yard all the ducklings walked up and down, and the cat&#10;too: it basked in the sun and licked the sunshine from its own&#10;paws. And when one looked at the fields, how beautifully the corn&#10;stood and how green it shone, without comparison! and there was a&#10;twittering and a fluttering of all the little birds, as if the day&#10;were a great festival; and so it was, for it was Sunday. All the&#10;bells were ringing, and all the people went to church, looking&#10;cheerful, and dressed in their best clothes. There was a look of&#10;cheerfulness on everything. The day was so warm and beautiful that&#10;one might well have said: &#34;God&#39;s kindness to us men is beyond all&#10;limits.&#34; But inside the church the pastor stood in the pulpit, and&#10;spoke very loudly and angrily. He said that all men were wicked,&#10;and God would punish them for their sins, and that the wicked, when&#10;they died, would be cast into hell, to burn for ever and ever. He&#10;spoke very excitedly, saying that their evil propensities would not&#10;be destroyed, nor would the fire be extinguished, and they should&#10;never find rest. That was terrible to hear, and he said it in such&#10;a tone of conviction; he described hell to them as a miserable hole&#10;where all the refuse of the world gathers. There was no air beside&#10;the hot burning sulphur flame, and there was no ground under their&#10;feet; they, the wicked ones, sank deeper and deeper, while eternal&#10;silence surrounded them! It was dreadful to hear all that, for the&#10;preacher spoke from his heart, and all the people in the church&#10;were terrified. Meanwhile, the birds sang merrily outside, and the&#10;sun was shining so beautifully warm, it seemed as though every&#10;little flower said: &#34;God, Thy kindness towards us all is without&#10;limits.&#34; Indeed, outside it was not at all like the pastor&#39;s&#10;sermon.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The same evening, upon going to bed, the pastor noticed&#10;his wife sitting there quiet and pensive.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What is the matter with you?&#34; he asked her.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Well, the matter with me is,&#34; she said, &#34;that I cannot&#10;collect my thoughts, and am unable to grasp the meaning of what you&#10;said to-day in church&#8212;that there are so many wicked people, and&#10;that they should burn eternally. Alas! eternally&#8212;how long! I am&#10;only a woman and a sinner before God, but I should not have the&#10;heart to let even the worst sinner burn for ever, and how could our&#10;Lord to do so, who is so infinitely good, and who knows how the&#10;wickedness comes from without and within? No, I am unable to&#10;imagine that, although you say so.&#34;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was autumn; the trees dropped their leaves, the earnest&#10;and severe pastor sat at the bedside of a dying person. A pious,&#10;faithful soul closed her eyes for ever; she was the pastor&#39;s&#10;wife.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;If any one shall find rest in the grave and mercy before&#10;our Lord you shall certainly do so,&#34; said the pastor. He folded her&#10;hands and read a psalm over the dead woman.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;She was buried; two large tears rolled over the cheeks of&#10;the earnest man, and in the parsonage it was empty and still, for&#10;its sun had set for ever. She had gone home.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was night. A cold wind swept over the pastor&#39;s head; he&#10;opened his eyes, and it seemed to him as if the moon was shining&#10;into his room. It was not so, however; there was a being standing&#10;before his bed, and looking like the ghost of his deceased wife.&#10;She fixed her eyes upon him with such a kind and sad expression,&#10;just as if she wished to say something to him. The pastor raised&#10;himself in bed and stretched his arms towards her, saying, &#34;Not&#10;even you can find eternal rest! You suffer, you best and most pious&#10;woman?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The dead woman nodded her head as if to say &#34;Yes,&#34; and put&#10;her hand on her breast.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And can I not obtain rest in the grave for&#10;you?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes,&#34; was the answer.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And how?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Give me one hair&#8212;only one single hair&#8212;from the head of&#10;the sinner for whom the fire shall never be extinguished, of the&#10;sinner whom God will condemn to eternal punishment in&#10;hell.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, one ought to be able to redeem you so easily, you&#10;pure, pious woman,&#34; he said.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Follow me,&#34; said the dead woman. &#34;It is thus granted to&#10;us. By my side you will be able to fly wherever your thoughts wish&#10;to go. Invisible to men, we shall penetrate into their most secret&#10;chambers; but with sure hand you must find out him who is destined&#10;to eternal torture, and before the cock crows he must be found!&#34; As&#10;quickly as if carried by the winged thoughts they were in the great&#10;city, and from the walls the names of the deadly sins shone in&#10;flaming letters: pride, avarice, drunkenness, wantonness&#8212;in short,&#10;the whole seven-coloured bow of sin.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, therein, as I believed, as I knew it,&#34; said the&#10;pastor, &#34;are living those who are abandoned to the eternal fire.&#34;&#10;And they were standing before the magnificently illuminated gate;&#10;the broad steps were adorned with carpets and flowers, and dance&#10;music was sounding through the festive halls. A footman dressed in&#10;silk and velvet stood with a large silver-mounted rod near the&#10;entrance.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Our ball can compare favourably with the king&#39;s,&#34; he&#10;said, and turned with contempt towards the gazing crowd in the&#10;street. What he thought was sufficiently expressed in his features&#10;and movements: &#34;Miserable beggars, who are looking in, you are&#10;nothing in comparison to me.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Pride,&#34; said the dead woman; &#34;do you see him?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The footman?&#34; asked the pastor. &#34;He is but a poor fool,&#10;and not doomed to be tortured eternally by fire!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Only a fool!&#34; It sounded through the whole house of&#10;pride: they were all fools there.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then they flew within the four naked walls of the miser.&#10;Lean as a skeleton, trembling with cold, and hunger, the old man&#10;was clinging with all his thoughts to his money. They saw him jump&#10;up feverishly from his miserable couch and take a loose stone out&#10;of the wall; there lay gold coins in an old stocking. They saw him&#10;anxiously feeling over an old ragged coat in which pieces of gold&#10;were sewn, and his clammy fingers trembled.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;He is ill! That is madness&#8212;a joyless madness&#8212;besieged by&#10;fear and dreadful dreams!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;They quickly went away and came before the beds of the&#10;criminals; these unfortunate people slept side by side, in long&#10;rows. Like a ferocious animal, one of them rose out of his sleep&#10;and uttered a horrible cry, and gave his comrade a violent dig in&#10;the ribs with his pointed elbow, and this one turned round in his&#10;sleep:&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Be quiet, monster&#8212;sleep! This happens every&#10;night!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Every night!&#34; repeated the other. &#34;Yes, every night he&#10;comes and tortures me! In my violence I have done this and that. I&#10;was born with an evil mind, which has brought me hither for the&#10;second time; but if I have done wrong I suffer punishment for it.&#10;One thing, however, I have not yet confessed. When I came out a&#10;little while ago, and passed by the yard of my former master, evil&#10;thoughts rose within me when I remembered this and that. I struck a&#10;match a little bit on the wall; probably it came a little too close&#10;to the thatched roof. All burnt down&#8212;a great heat rose, such as&#10;sometimes overcomes me. I myself helped to rescue cattle and&#10;things, nothing alive burnt, except a flight of pigeons, which flew&#10;into the fire, and the yard dog, of which I had not thought; one&#10;could hear him howl out of the fire, and this howling I still hear&#10;when I wish to sleep; and when I have fallen asleep, the great&#10;rough dog comes and places himself upon me, and howls, presses, and&#10;tortures me. Now listen to what I tell you! You can snore; you are&#10;snoring the whole night, and I hardly a quarter of an hour!&#34; And&#10;the blood rose to the head of the excited criminal; he threw&#10;himself upon his comrade, and beat him with his clenced fist in the&#10;face.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Wicked Matz has become mad again!&#34; they said amongst&#10;themselves. The other criminals seized him, wrestled with him, and&#10;bent him double, so that his head rested between his knees, and&#10;they tied him, so that the blood almost came out of his eyes and&#10;out of all his pores.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You are killing the unfortunate man,&#34; said the pastor,&#10;and as he stretched out his hand to protect him who already&#10;suffered too much, the scene changed. They flew through rich halls&#10;and wretched hovels; wantonness and envy, all the deadly sins,&#10;passed before them. An angel of justice read their crimes and their&#10;defence; the latter was not a brilliant one, but it was read before&#10;God, Who reads the heart, Who knows everything, the wickedness that&#10;comes from within and from without, Who is mercy and love&#10;personified. The pastor&#39;s hand trembled; he dared not stretch it&#10;out, he did not venture to pull a hair out of the sinner&#39;s head.&#10;And tears gushed from his eyes like a stream of mercy and love, the&#10;cooling waters of which extinguished the eternal fire of&#10;hell.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Just then the cock crowed.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Father of all mercy, grant Thou to her the peace that I&#10;was unable to procure for her!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I have it now!&#34; said the dead woman. &#34;It was your hard&#10;words, your despair of mankind, your gloomy belief in God and His&#10;creation, which drove me to you. Learn to know mankind! Even in the&#10;wicked one lives a part of God&#8212;and this extinguishes and conquers&#10;the flame of hell!&#34;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The pastor felt a kiss on his lips; a gleam of light&#10;surrounded him&#8212;God&#39;s bright sun shone into the room, and his wife,&#10;alive, sweet and full of love, awoke him from a dream which God had&#10;sent him! &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')

Balsams and other flowers greet us from the&#10;long rows of windows in the house, whose interior is sufficiently&#10;poverty-stricken; and poor and old are the people who inhabit it.&#10;The building is the Warton Almshouse.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Look! at the window there leans an old maid. She plucks&#10;the withered leaf from the balsam, and looks at the grass-covered&#10;rampart, on which many children are playing. What is the old maid&#10;thinking of? A whole life drama is unfolding itself before her&#10;inward gaze.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The poor little children, how happy they are&#8212;how merrily&#10;they play and romp together! What red cheeks and what angels&#39; eyes!&#10;but they have no shoes nor stockings. They dance on the green&#10;rampart, just on the place where, according to the old story, the&#10;ground always sank in, and where a sportive, frolicsome child had&#10;been lured by means of flowers, toys and sweetmeats into an open&#10;grave ready dug for it, and which was afterwards closed over the&#10;child; and from that moment, the old story says, the ground gave&#10;way no longer, the mound remained firm and fast, and was quickly&#10;covered with the green turf. The little people who now play on that&#10;spot know nothing of the old tale, else would they fancy they heard&#10;a child crying deep below the earth, and the dewdrops on each blade&#10;of grass would be to them tears of woe. Nor do they know anything&#10;of the Danish King who here, in the face of the coming foe, took an&#10;oath before all his trembling courtiers that he would hold out with&#10;the citizens of his capital, and die here in his nest; they know&#10;nothing of the men who have fought here, or of the women who from&#10;here have drenched with boiling water the enemy, clad in white, and&#10;&#39;biding in the snow to surprise the city.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No! the poor little ones are playing with light, childish&#10;spirits. Play on, play on, thou little maiden! Soon the years will&#10;come&#8212;yes, those glorious years. The priestly hands have been laid&#10;on the candidates for confirmation; hand in hand they walk on the&#10;green rampart. Thou hast a white frock on; it has cost thy mother&#10;much labor, and yet it is only cut down for thee out of an old&#10;larger dress! You will also wear a red shawl; and what if it hang&#10;too far down? People will only see how large, how very large it is.&#10;You are thinking of your dress, and of the Giver of all good&#8212;so&#10;glorious is it to wander on the green rampart!&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And the years roll by; they have no lack of dark days,&#10;but you have your cheerful young spirit, and you have gained a&#10;friend&#8212;you know not how. You met, oh, how often! You walk together&#10;on the rampart in the fresh spring, on the high days and holidays,&#10;when all the world come out to walk upon the ramparts, and all the&#10;bells of the church steeples seem to be singing a song of praise&#10;for the coming spring.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Scarcely have the violets come forth, but there on the&#10;rampart, just opposite the beautiful Castle of Rosenberg, there is&#10;a tree bright with the first green buds. Every year this tree sends&#10;forth fresh green shoots. Alas! It is not so with the human heart!&#10;Dark mists, more in number than those that cover the northern&#10;skies, cloud the human heart. Poor child! thy friend&#39;s bridal&#10;chamber is a black coffin, and thou becomest an old maid. From the&#10;almshouse window, behind the balsams, thou shalt look on the merry&#10;children at play, and shalt see thine own history&#10;renewed.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And that is the life drama that passes before the old maid&#10;while she looks out upon the rampart, the green, sunny rampart,&#10;where the children, with their red cheeks and bare shoeless feet,&#10;are rejoicing merrily, like the other free little birds.&#10;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode(''), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;WHENEVER a good child dies, an angel of God comes down&#10;from heaven, takes the dead child in his arms, spreads out his&#10;great white wings, and flies with him over all the places which the&#10;child had loved during his life. Then he gathers a large handful of&#10;flowers, which he carries up to the Almighty, that they may bloom&#10;more brightly in heaven than they do on earth. And the Almighty&#10;presses the flowers to His heart, but He kisses the flower that&#10;pleases Him best, and it receives a voice, and is able to join the&#10;song of the chorus of bliss.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;These words were spoken by an angel of God, as he carried&#10;a dead child up to heaven, and the child listened as if in a dream.&#10;Then they passed over well-known spots, where the little one had&#10;often played, and through beautiful gardens full of lovely&#10;flowers.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Which of these shall we take with us to heaven to be&#10;transplanted there?&#34; asked the angel.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Close by grew a slender, beautiful, rose-bush, but some&#10;wicked hand had broken the stem, and the half-opened rosebuds hung&#10;faded and withered on the trailing branches.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Poor rose-bush!&#34; said the child, &#34;let us take it with us&#10;to heaven, that it may bloom above in God&#39;s garden.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The angel took up the rose-bush; then he kissed the child,&#10;and the little one half opened his eyes. The angel gathered also&#10;some beautiful flowers, as well as a few humble buttercups and&#10;heart&#39;s-ease.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Now we have flowers enough,&#34; said the child; but the&#10;angel only nodded, he did not fly upward to heaven.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was night, and quite still in the great town. Here they&#10;remained, and the angel hovered over a small, narrow street, in&#10;which lay a large heap of straw, ashes, and sweepings from the&#10;houses of people who had removed. There lay fragments of plates,&#10;pieces of plaster, rags, old hats, and other rubbish not pleasant&#10;to see. Amidst all this confusion, the angel pointed to the pieces&#10;of a broken flower-pot, and to a lump of earth which had fallen out&#10;of it. The earth had been kept from falling to pieces by the roots&#10;of a withered field-flower, which had been thrown amongst the&#10;rubbish.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;We will take this with us,&#34; said the angel, &#34;I will tell&#10;you why as we fly along.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And as they flew the angel related the history.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Down in that narrow lane, in a low cellar, lived a poor&#10;sick boy; he had been afflicted from his childhood, and even in his&#10;best days he could just manage to walk up and down the room on&#10;crutches once or twice, but no more. During some days in summer,&#10;the sunbeams would lie on the floor of the cellar for about half an&#10;hour. In this spot the poor sick boy would sit warming himself in&#10;the sunshine, and watching the red blood through his delicate&#10;fingers as he held them before his face. Then he would say he had&#10;been out, yet he knew nothing of the green forest in its spring&#10;verdure, till a neighbor&#39;s son brought him a green bough from a&#10;beech-tree. This he would place over his head, and fancy that he&#10;was in the beech-wood while the sun shone, and the birds carolled&#10;gayly. One spring day the neighbor&#39;s boy brought him some&#10;field-flowers, and among them was one to which the root still&#10;adhered. This he carefully planted in a flower-pot, and placed in a&#10;window-seat near his bed. And the flower had been planted by a&#10;fortunate hand, for it grew, put forth fresh shoots, and blossomed&#10;every year. It became a splendid flower-garden to the sick boy, and&#10;his little treasure upon earth. He watered it, and cherished it,&#10;and took care it should have the benefit of every sunbeam that&#10;found its way into the cellar, from the earliest morning ray to the&#10;evening sunset. The flower entwined itself even in his dreams&#8212;for&#10;him it bloomed, for him spread its perfume. And it gladdened his&#10;eyes, and to the flower he turned, even in death, when the Lord&#10;called him. He has been one year with God. During that time the&#10;flower has stood in the window, withered and forgotten, till at&#10;length cast out among the sweepings into the street, on the day of&#10;the lodgers&#39; removal. And this poor flower, withered and faded as&#10;it is, we have added to our nosegay, because it gave more real joy&#10;than the most beautiful flower in the garden of a&#10;queen.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But how do you know all this?&#34; asked the child whom the&#10;angel was carrying to heaven.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I know it,&#34; said the angel, &#34;because I myself was the&#10;poor sick boy who walked upon crutches, and I know my own flower&#10;well.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the child opened his eyes and looked into the&#10;glorious happy face of the angel, and at the same moment they found&#10;themselves in that heavenly home where all is happiness and joy.&#10;And God pressed the dead child to His heart, and wings were given&#10;him so that he could fly with the angel, hand in hand. Then the&#10;Almighty pressed all the flowers to His heart; but He kissed the&#10;withered field-flower, and it received a voice. Then it joined in&#10;the song of the angels, who surrounded the throne, some near, and&#10;others in a distant circle, but all equally happy. They all joined&#10;in the chorus of praise, both great and small,&#8212;the good, happy&#10;child, and the poor field-flower, that once lay withered and cast&#10;away on a heap of rubbish in a narrow, dark street.&#10;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')

She had a little child, not at all pretty; so he was put out&#10;to be nursed by a laborer&#39;s wife, and his mother went to the&#10;count&#39;s castle. She sat in splendid rooms, richly decorated with&#10;silk and velvet; not a breath of air was allowed to blow upon her,&#10;and no one was allowed to speak to her harshly, for she was nurse&#10;to the count&#39;s child. He was fair and delicate as a prince, and&#10;beautiful as an angel; and how she loved this child! Her own boy&#10;was provided for by being at the laborer&#39;s where the mouth watered&#10;more frequently than the pot boiled, and where in general no one&#10;was at home to take care of the child. Then he would cry, but what&#10;nobody knows nobody cares for; so he would cry till he was tired,&#10;and then fall asleep; and while we are asleep we can feel neither&#10;hunger nor thirst. Ah, yes; sleep is a capital&#10;invention.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;As years went on, Anne Lisbeth&#39;s child grew apace like&#10;weeds, although they said his growth had been stunted. He had&#10;become quite a member of the family in which he dwelt; they&#10;received money to keep him, so that his mother got rid of him&#10;altogether. She had become quite a lady; she had a comfortable home&#10;of her own in the town; and out of doors, when she went for a walk,&#10;she wore a bonnet; but she never walked out to see the laborer:&#10;that was too far from the town, and, indeed, she had nothing to go&#10;for, the boy now belonged to these laboring people. He had food,&#10;and he could also do something towards earning his living; he took&#10;care of Mary&#39;s red cow, for he knew how to tend cattle and make&#10;himself useful.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The great dog by the yard gate of a nobleman&#39;s mansion&#10;sits proudly on the top of his kennel when the sun shines, and&#10;barks at every one that passes; but if it rains, he creeps into his&#10;house, and there he is warm and dry. Anne Lisbeth&#39;s boy also sat in&#10;the sunshine on the top of the fence, cutting out a little toy. If&#10;it was spring-time, he knew of three strawberry-plants in blossom,&#10;which would certainly bear fruit. This was his most hopeful&#10;thought, though it often came to nothing. And he had to sit out in&#10;the rain in the worst weather, and get wet to the skin, and let the&#10;cold wind dry the clothes on his back afterwards. If he went near&#10;the farmyard belonging to the count, he was pushed and knocked&#10;about, for the men and the maids said he was so horrible ugly; but&#10;he was used to all this, for nobody loved him. This was how the&#10;world treated Anne Lisbeth&#39;s boy, and how could it be otherwise. It&#10;was his fate to be beloved by no one. Hitherto he had been a land&#10;crab; the land at last cast him adrift. He went to sea in a&#10;wretched vessel, and sat at the helm, while the skipper sat over&#10;the grog-can. He was dirty and ugly, half-frozen and half-starved;&#10;he always looked as if he never had enough to eat, which was really&#10;the case.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Late in the autumn, when the weather was rough, windy, and&#10;wet, and the cold penetrated through the thickest clothing,&#10;especially at sea, a wretched boat went out to sea with only two&#10;men on board, or, more correctly, a man and a half, for it was the&#10;skipper and his boy. There had only been a kind of twilight all&#10;day, and it soon grew quite dark, and so bitterly cold, that the&#10;skipper took a dram to warm him. The bottle was old, and the glass&#10;too. It was perfect in the upper part, but the foot was broken off,&#10;and it had therefore been fixed upon a little carved block of wood,&#10;painted blue. A dram is a great comfort, and two are better still,&#10;thought the skipper, while the boy sat at the helm, which he held&#10;fast in his hard seamed hands. He was ugly, and his hair was&#10;matted, and he looked crippled and stunted; they called him the&#10;field-laborer&#39;s boy, though in the church register he was entered&#10;as Anne Lisbeth&#39;s son. The wind cut through the rigging, and the&#10;boat cut through the sea. The sails, filled by the wind, swelled&#10;out and carried them along in wild career. It was wet and rough&#10;above and below, and might still be worse. Hold! what is that? What&#10;has struck the boat? Was it a waterspout, or a heavy sea rolling&#10;suddenly upon them?&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Heaven help us!&#34; cried the boy at the helm, as the boat&#10;heeled over and lay on its beam ends. It had struck on a rock,&#10;which rose from the depths of the sea, and sank at once, like an&#10;old shoe in a puddle. &#34;It sank at once with mouse and man,&#34; as the&#10;saying is. There might have been mice on board, but only one man&#10;and a half, the skipper and the laborer&#39;s boy. No one saw it but&#10;the skimming sea-gulls and the fishes beneath the water; and even&#10;they did not see it properly, for they darted back with terror as&#10;the boat filled with water and sank. There it lay, scarcely a&#10;fathom below the surface, and those two were provided for, buried,&#10;and forgotten. The glass with the foot of blue wood was the only&#10;thing that did not sink, for the wood floated and the glass drifted&#10;away to be cast upon the shore and broken; where and when, is&#10;indeed of no consequence. It had served its purpose, and it had&#10;been loved, which Anne Lisbeth&#39;s boy had not been. But in heaven no&#10;soul will be able to say, &#34;Never loved.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Anne Lisbeth had now lived in the town many years; she was&#10;called &#34;Madame,&#34; and felt dignified in consequence; she remembered&#10;the old, noble days, in which she had driven in the carriage, and&#10;had associated with countess and baroness. Her beautiful, noble&#10;child had been a dear angel, and possessed the kindest heart; he&#10;had loved her so much, and she had loved him in return; they had&#10;kissed and loved each other, and the boy had been her joy, her&#10;second life. Now he was fourteen years of age, tall, handsome, and&#10;clever. She had not seen him since she carried him in her arms;&#10;neither had she been for years to the count&#39;s palace; it was quite&#10;a journey thither from the town.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I must make one effort to go,&#34; said Anne Lisbeth, &#34;to see&#10;my darling, the count&#39;s sweet child, and press him to my heart.&#10;Certainly he must long to see me, too, the young count; no doubt he&#10;thinks of me and loves me, as in those days when he would fling his&#10;angel-arms round my neck, and lisp &#39;Anne Liz.&#39; It was music to my&#10;ears. Yes, I must make an effort to see him again.&#34; She drove&#10;across the country in a grazier&#39;s cart, and then got out, and&#10;continued her journey on foot, and thus reached the count&#39;s castle.&#10;It was as great and magnificent as it had always been, and the&#10;garden looked the same as ever; all the servants were strangers to&#10;her, not one of them knew Anne Lisbeth, nor of what consequence she&#10;had once been there; but she felt sure the countess would soon let&#10;them know it, and her darling boy, too: how she longed to see&#10;him!&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Now that Anne Lisbeth was at her journey&#39;s end, she was&#10;kept waiting a long time; and for those who wait, time passes&#10;slowly. But before the great people went in to dinner, she was&#10;called in and spoken to very graciously. She was to go in again&#10;after dinner, and then she would see her sweet boy once more. How&#10;tall, and slender, and thin he had grown; but the eyes and the&#10;sweet angel mouth were still beautiful. He looked at her, but he&#10;did not speak, he certainly did not know who she was. He turned&#10;round and was going away, but she seized his hand and pressed it to&#10;her lips.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Well, well,&#34; he said; and with that he walked out of the&#10;room. He who filled her every thought! he whom she loved best, and&#10;who was her whole earthly pride!&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Anne Lisbeth went forth from the castle into the public&#10;road, feeling mournful and sad; he whom she had nursed day and&#10;night, and even now carried about in her dreams, had been cold and&#10;strange, and had not a word or thought respecting her. A great&#10;black raven darted down in front of her on the high road, and&#10;croaked dismally.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ah,&#34; said she, &#34;what bird of ill omen art thou?&#34;&#10;Presently she passed the laborer&#39;s hut; his wife stood at the door,&#10;and the two women spoke to each other.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You look well,&#34; said the woman; &#34;you&#39;re fat and plump;&#10;you are well off.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh yes,&#34; answered Anne Lisbeth.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The boat went down with them,&#34; continued the woman; &#34;Hans&#10;the skipper and the boy were both drowned; so there&#39;s an end of&#10;them. I always thought the boy would be able to help me with a few&#10;dollars. He&#39;ll never cost you anything more, Anne&#10;Lisbeth.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;So they were drowned,&#34; repeated Anne Lisbeth; but she&#10;said no more, and the subject was dropped. She felt very&#10;low-spirited, because her count-child had shown no inclination to&#10;speak to her who loved him so well, and who had travelled so far to&#10;see him. The journey had cost money too, and she had derived no&#10;great pleasure from it. Still she said not a word of all this; she&#10;could not relieve her heart by telling the laborer&#39;s wife, lest the&#10;latter should think she did not enjoy her former position at the&#10;castle. Then the raven flew over her, screaming again as he&#10;flew.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The black wretch!&#34; said Anne Lisbeth, &#34;he will end by&#10;frightening me today.&#34; She had brought coffee and chicory with her,&#10;for she thought it would be a charity to the poor woman to give&#10;them to her to boil a cup of coffee, and then she would take a cup&#10;herself.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The woman prepared the coffee, and in the meantime Anne&#10;Lisbeth seated her in a chair and fell asleep. Then she dreamed of&#10;something which she had never dreamed before; singularly enough she&#10;dreamed of her own child, who had wept and hungered in the&#10;laborer&#39;s hut, and had been knocked about in heat and in cold, and&#10;who was now lying in the depths of the sea, in a spot only known by&#10;God. She fancied she was still sitting in the hut, where the woman&#10;was busy preparing the coffee, for she could smell the&#10;coffee-berries roasting. But suddenly it seemed to her that there&#10;stood on the threshold a beautiful young form, as beautiful as the&#10;count&#39;s child, and this apparition said to her, &#34;The world is&#10;passing away; hold fast to me, for you are my mother after all; you&#10;have an angel in heaven, hold me fast;&#34; and the child-angel&#10;stretched out his hand and seized her. Then there was a terrible&#10;crash, as of a world crumbling to pieces, and the angel-child was&#10;rising from the earth, and holding her by the sleeve so tightly&#10;that she felt herself lifted from the ground; but, on the other&#10;hand, something heavy hung to her feet and dragged her down, and it&#10;seemed as if hundreds of women were clinging to her, and crying,&#10;&#34;If thou art to be saved, we must be saved too. Hold fast, hold&#10;fast.&#34; And then they all hung on her, but there were too many; and&#10;as they clung the sleeve was torn, and Anne Lisbeth fell down in&#10;horror, and awoke. Indeed she was on the point of falling over in&#10;reality with the chair on which she sat; but she was so startled&#10;and alarmed that she could not remember what she had dreamed, only&#10;that it was something very dreadful.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;They drank their coffee and had a chat together, and then&#10;Anne Lisbeth went away towards the little town where she was to&#10;meet the carrier, who was to drive her back to her own home. But&#10;when she came to him she found that he would not be ready to start&#10;till the evening of the next day. Then she began to think of the&#10;expense, and what the distance would be to walk. She remembered&#10;that the route by the sea-shore was two miles shorter than by the&#10;high road; and as the weather was clear, and there would be&#10;moonlight, she determined to make her way on foot, and to start at&#10;once, that she might reach home the next day.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The sun had set, and the evening bells sounded through the&#10;air from the tower of the village church, but to her it was not the&#10;bells, but the cry of the frogs in the marshes. Then they ceased,&#10;and all around became still; not a bird could be heard, they were&#10;all at rest, even the owl had not left her hiding place; deep&#10;silence reigned on the margin of the wood by the sea-shore. As Anne&#10;Lisbeth walked on she could hear her own footsteps in the sands;&#10;even the waves of the sea were at rest, and all in the deep waters&#10;had sunk into silence. There was quiet among the dead and the&#10;living in the deep sea. Anne Lisbeth walked on, thinking of nothing&#10;at all, as people say, or rather her thoughts wandered, but not&#10;away from her, for thought is never absent from us, it only&#10;slumbers. Many thoughts that have lain dormant are roused at the&#10;proper time, and begin to stir in the mind and the heart, and seem&#10;even to come upon us from above. It is written, that a good deed&#10;bears a blessing for its fruit; and it is also written, that the&#10;wages of sin is death. Much has been said and much written which we&#10;pass over or know nothing of. A light arises within us, and then&#10;forgotten things make themselves remembered; and thus it was with&#10;Anne Lisbeth. The germ of every vice and every virtue lies in our&#10;heart, in yours and in mine; they lie like little grains of seed,&#10;till a ray of sunshine, or the touch of an evil hand, or you turn&#10;the corner to the right or to the left, and the decision is made.&#10;The little seed is stirred, it swells and shoots up, and pours its&#10;sap into your blood, directing your course either for good or evil.&#10;Troublesome thoughts often exist in the mind, fermenting there,&#10;which are not realized by us while the senses are as it were&#10;slumbering; but still they are there. Anne Lisbeth walked on thus&#10;with her senses half asleep, but the thoughts were fermenting&#10;within her.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;From one Shrove Tuesday to another, much may occur to&#10;weigh down the heart; it is the reckoning of a whole year; much may&#10;be forgotten, sins against heaven in word and thought, sins against&#10;our neighbor, and against our own conscience. We are scarcely aware&#10;of their existence; and Anne Lisbeth did not think of any of her&#10;errors. She had committed no crime against the law of the land; she&#10;was an honorable person, in a good position&#8212;that she&#10;knew.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;She continued her walk along by the margin of the sea.&#10;What was it she saw lying there? An old hat; a man&#39;s hat. Now when&#10;might that have been washed overboard? She drew nearer, she stopped&#10;to look at the hat; &#34;Ha! what was lying yonder?&#34; She shuddered; yet&#10;it was nothing save a heap of grass and tangled seaweed flung&#10;across a long stone, but it looked like a corpse. Only tangled&#10;grass, and yet she was frightened at it. As she turned to walk&#10;away, much came into her mind that she had heard in her childhood:&#10;old superstitions of spectres by the sea-shore; of the ghosts of&#10;drowned but unburied people, whose corpses had been washed up on&#10;the desolate beach. The body, she knew, could do no harm to any&#10;one, but the spirit could pursue the lonely wanderer, attach itself&#10;to him, and demand to be carried to the churchyard, that it might&#10;rest in consecrated ground. &#34;Hold fast! hold fast!&#34; the spectre&#10;would cry; and as Anne Lisbeth murmured these words to herself, the&#10;whole of her dream was suddenly recalled to her memory, when the&#10;mother had clung to her, and uttered these words, when, amid the&#10;crashing of worlds, her sleeve had been torn, and she had slipped&#10;from the grasp of her child, who wanted to hold her up in that&#10;terrible hour. Her child, her own child, which she had never loved,&#10;lay now buried in the sea, and might rise up, like a spectre, from&#10;the waters, and cry, &#34;Hold fast; carry me to consecrated&#10;ground!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;As these thoughts passed through her mind, fear gave speed&#10;to her feet, so that she walked faster and faster. Fear came upon&#10;her as if a cold, clammy hand had been laid upon her heart, so that&#10;she almost fainted. As she looked across the sea, all there grew&#10;darker; a heavy mist came rolling onwards, and clung to bush and&#10;tree, distorting them into fantastic shapes. She turned and glanced&#10;at the moon, which had risen behind her. It looked like a pale,&#10;rayless surface, and a deadly weight seemed to hang upon her limbs.&#10;&#34;Hold,&#34; thought she; and then she turned round a second time to&#10;look at the moon. A white face appeared quite close to her, with a&#10;mist, hanging like a garment from its shoulders. &#34;Stop! carry me to&#10;consecrated earth,&#34; sounded in her ears, in strange, hollow tones.&#10;The sound did not come from frogs or ravens; she saw no sign of&#10;such creatures. &#34;A grave! dig me a grave!&#34; was repeated quite loud.&#10;Yes, it was indeed the spectre of her child. The child that lay&#10;beneath the ocean, and whose spirit could have no rest until it was&#10;carried to the churchyard, and until a grave had been dug for it in&#10;consecrated ground. She would go there at once, and there she would&#10;dig. She turned in the direction of the church, and the weight on&#10;her heart seemed to grow lighter, and even to vanish altogether;&#10;but when she turned to go home by the shortest way, it returned.&#10;&#34;Stop! stop!&#34; and the words came quite clear, though they were like&#10;the croak of a frog, or the wail of a bird. &#34;A grave! dig me a&#10;grave!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The mist was cold and damp, her hands and face were moist&#10;and clammy with horror, a heavy weight again seized her and clung&#10;to her, her mind became clear for thoughts that had never before&#10;been there.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In these northern regions, a beech-wood often buds in a&#10;single night and appears in the morning sunlight in its full glory&#10;of youthful green. So, in a single instant, can the consciousness&#10;of the sin that has been committed in thoughts, words, and actions&#10;of our past life, be unfolded to us. When once the conscience is&#10;awakened, it springs up in the heart spontaneously, and God awakens&#10;the conscience when we least expect it. Then we can find no excuse&#10;for ourselves; the deed is there and bears witness against us. The&#10;thoughts seem to become words, and to sound far out into the world.&#10;We are horrified at the thought of what we have carried within us,&#10;and at the consciousness that we have not overcome the evil which&#10;has its origin in thoughtlessness and pride. The heart conceals&#10;within itself the vices as well as the virtues, and they grow in&#10;the shallowest ground. Anne Lisbeth now experienced in thought what&#10;we have clothed in words. She was overpowered by them, and sank&#10;down and crept along for some distance on the ground. &#34;A grave! dig&#10;me a grave!&#34; sounded again in her ears, and she would have gladly&#10;buried herself, if in the grave she could have found forgetfulness&#10;of her actions.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was the first hour of her awakening, full of anguish&#10;and horror. Superstition made her alternately shudder with cold or&#10;burn with the heat of fever. Many things, of which she had feared&#10;even to speak, came into her mind. Silently, as the cloud-shadows&#10;in the moonshine, a spectral apparition flitted by her; she had&#10;heard of it before. Close by her galloped four snorting steeds,&#10;with fire flashing from their eyes and nostrils. They dragged a&#10;burning coach, and within it sat the wicked lord of the manor, who&#10;had ruled there a hundred years before. The legend says that every&#10;night, at twelve o&#39;clock, he drove into his castleyard and out&#10;again. He was not as pale as dead men are, but black as a coal. He&#10;nodded, and pointed to Anne Lisbeth, crying out, &#34;Hold fast! hold&#10;fast! and then you may ride again in a nobleman&#39;s carriage, and&#10;forget your child.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;She gathered herself up, and hastened to the churchyard;&#10;but black crosses and black ravens danced before her eyes, and she&#10;could not distinguish one from the other. The ravens croaked as the&#10;raven had done which she saw in the daytime, but now she understood&#10;what they said. &#34;I am the raven-mother; I am the raven-mother,&#34;&#10;each raven croaked, and Anne Lisbeth felt that the name also&#10;applied to her; and she fancied she should be transformed into a&#10;black bird, and have to cry as they cried, if she did not dig the&#10;grave. And she threw herself upon the earth, and with her hands dug&#10;a grave in the hard ground, so that the blood ran from her fingers.&#10;&#34;A grave! dig me a grave!&#34; still sounded in her ears; she was&#10;fearful that the cock might crow, and the first red streak appear&#10;in the east, before she had finished her work; and then she would&#10;be lost. And the cock crowed, and the day dawned in the east, and&#10;the grave was only half dug. An icy hand passed over her head and&#10;face, and down towards her heart. &#34;Only half a grave,&#34; a voice&#10;wailed, and fled away. Yes, it fled away over the sea; it was the&#10;ocean spectre; and, exhausted and overpowered, Anne Lisbeth sunk to&#10;the ground, and her senses left her.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was a bright day when she came to herself, and two men&#10;were raising her up; but she was not lying in the churchyard, but&#10;on the sea-shore, where she had dug a deep hole in the sand, and&#10;cut her hand with a piece of broken glass, whose sharp stern was&#10;stuck in a little block of painted wood. Anne Lisbeth was in a&#10;fever. Conscience had roused the memories of superstitions, and had&#10;so acted upon her mind, that she fancied she had only half a soul,&#10;and that her child had taken the other half down into the sea.&#10;Never would she be able to cling to the mercy of Heaven till she&#10;had recovered this other half which was now held fast in the deep&#10;water.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Anne Lisbeth returned to her home, but she was no longer&#10;the woman she had been. Her thoughts were like a confused, tangled&#10;skein; only one thread, only one thought was clear to her, namely&#10;that she must carry the spectre of the sea-shore to the churchyard,&#10;and dig a grave for him there; that by so doing she might win back&#10;her soul. Many a night she was missed from her home, and was always&#10;found on the sea-shore waiting for the spectre.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In this way a whole year passed; and then one night she&#10;vanished again, and was not to be found. The whole of the next day&#10;was spent in a useless search after her.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Towards evening, when the clerk entered the church to toll&#10;the vesper bell, he saw by the altar Anne Lisbeth, who had spent&#10;the whole day there. Her powers of body were almost exhausted, but&#10;her eyes flashed brightly, and on her cheeks was a rosy flush. The&#10;last rays of the setting sun shone upon her, and gleamed over the&#10;altar upon the shining clasps of the Bible, which lay open at the&#10;words of the prophet Joel, &#34;Rend your hearts and not your garments,&#10;and turn unto the Lord.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That was just a chance,&#34; people said; but do things&#10;happen by chance? In the face of Anne Lisbeth, lighted up by the&#10;evening sun, could be seen peace and rest. She said she was happy&#10;now, for she had conquered. The spectre of the shore, her own&#10;child, had come to her the night before, and had said to her, &#34;Thou&#10;hast dug me only half a grave: but thou hast now, for a year and a&#10;day, buried me altogether in thy heart, and it is there a mother&#10;can best hide her child!&#34; And then he gave her back her lost soul,&#10;and brought her into the church. &#34;Now I am in the house of God,&#34;&#10;she said, &#34;and in that house we are happy.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;When the sun set, Anne Lisbeth&#39;s soul had risen to that&#10;region where there is no more pain; and Anne Lisbeth&#39;s troubles&#10;were at an end. &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode(''), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;IT was the month of May. The wind still blew cold; but&#10;from bush and tree, field and flower, came the welcome sound,&#10;&#34;Spring is come.&#34; Wild-flowers in profusion covered the hedges.&#10;Under the little apple-tree, Spring seemed busy, and told his tale&#10;from one of the branches which hung fresh and blooming, and covered&#10;with delicate pink blossoms that were just ready to open. The&#10;branch well knew how beautiful it was; this knowledge exists as&#10;much in the leaf as in the blood; I was therefore not surprised&#10;when a nobleman&#39;s carriage, in which sat the young countess,&#10;stopped in the road just by. She said that an apple-branch was a&#10;most lovely object, and an emblem of spring in its most charming&#10;aspect. Then the branch was broken off for her, and she held it in&#10;her delicate hand, and sheltered it with her silk parasol. Then&#10;they drove to the castle, in which were lofty halls and splendid&#10;drawing-rooms. Pure white curtains fluttered before the open&#10;windows, and beautiful flowers stood in shining, transparent vases;&#10;and in one of them, which looked as if it had been cut out of newly&#10;fallen snow, the apple-branch was placed, among some fresh, light&#10;twigs of beech. It was a charming sight. Then the branch became&#10;proud, which was very much like human nature.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;People of every description entered the room, and,&#10;according to their position in society, so dared they to express&#10;their admiration. Some few said nothing, others expressed too much,&#10;and the apple-branch very soon got to understand that there was as&#10;much difference in the characters of human beings as in those of&#10;plants and flowers. Some are all for pomp and parade, others have a&#10;great deal to do to maintain their own importance, while the rest&#10;might be spared without much loss to society. So thought the&#10;apple-branch, as he stood before the open window, from which he&#10;could see out over gardens and fields, where there were flowers and&#10;plants enough for him to think and reflect upon; some rich and&#10;beautiful, some poor and humble indeed.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Poor, despised herbs,&#34; said the apple-branch; &#34;there is&#10;really a difference between them and such as I am. How unhappy they&#10;must be, if they can feel as those in my position do! There is a&#10;difference indeed, and so there ought to be, or we should all be&#10;equals.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the apple-branch looked with a sort of pity upon them,&#10;especially on a certain little flower that is found in fields and&#10;in ditches. No one bound these flowers together in a nosegay; they&#10;were too common; they were even known to grow between the&#10;paving-stones, shooting up everywhere, like bad weeds; and they&#10;bore the very ugly name of &#34;dog-flowers&#34; or&#10;&#34;dandelions.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Poor, despised plants,&#34; said the apple-bough, &#34;it is not&#10;your fault that you are so ugly, and that you have such an ugly&#10;name; but it is with plants as with men,&#8212;there must be a&#10;difference.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;A difference!&#34; cried the sunbeam, as he kissed the&#10;blooming apple-branch, and then kissed the yellow dandelion out in&#10;the fields. All were brothers, and the sunbeam kissed them&#8212;the poor&#10;flowers as well as the rich.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The apple-bough had never thought of the boundless love of&#10;God, which extends over all the works of creation, over everything&#10;which lives, and moves, and has its being in Him; he had never&#10;thought of the good and beautiful which are so often hidden, but&#10;can never remain forgotten by Him,&#8212;not only among the lower&#10;creation, but also among men. The sunbeam, the ray of light, knew&#10;better.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You do not see very far, nor very clearly,&#34; he said to&#10;the apple-branch. &#34;Which is the despised plant you so specially&#10;pity?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The dandelion,&#34; he replied. &#34;No one ever places it in a&#10;nosegay; it is often trodden under foot, there are so many of them;&#10;and when they run to seed, they have flowers like wool, which fly&#10;away in little pieces over the roads, and cling to the dresses of&#10;the people. They are only weeds; but of course there must be weeds.&#10;O, I am really very thankful that I was not made like one of these&#10;flowers.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;There came presently across the fields a whole group of&#10;children, the youngest of whom was so small that it had to be&#10;carried by the others; and when he was seated on the grass, among&#10;the yellow flowers, he laughed aloud with joy, kicked out his&#10;little legs, rolled about, plucked the yellow flowers, and kissed&#10;them in childlike innocence. The elder children broke off the&#10;flowers with long stems, bent the stalks one round the other, to&#10;form links, and made first a chain for the neck, then one to go&#10;across the shoulders, and hang down to the waist, and at last a&#10;wreath to wear round the head, so that they looked quite splendid&#10;in their garlands of green stems and golden flowers. But the eldest&#10;among them gathered carefully the faded flowers, on the stem of&#10;which was grouped together the seed, in the form of a white&#10;feathery coronal. These loose, airy wool-flowers are very&#10;beautiful, and look like fine snowy feathers or down. The children&#10;held them to their mouths, and tried to blow away the whole coronal&#10;with one puff of the breath. They had been told by their&#10;grandmothers that who ever did so would be sure to have new clothes&#10;before the end of the year. The despised flower was by this raised&#10;to the position of a prophet or foreteller of events.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Do you see,&#34; said the sunbeam, &#34;do you see the beauty of&#10;these flowers? do you see their powers of giving&#10;pleasure?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, to children,&#34; said the apple-bough.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;By-and-by an old woman came into the field, and, with a&#10;blunt knife without a handle, began to dig round the roots of some&#10;of the dandelion-plants, and pull them up. With some of these she&#10;intended to make tea for herself; but the rest she was going to&#10;sell to the chemist, and obtain some money.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But beauty is of higher value than all this,&#34; said the&#10;apple-tree branch; &#34;only the chosen ones can be admitted into the&#10;realms of the beautiful. There is a difference between plants, just&#10;as there is a difference between men.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the sunbeam spoke of the boundless love of God, as&#10;seen in creation, and over all that lives, and of the equal&#10;distribution of His gifts, both in time and in eternity.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That is your opinion,&#34; said the apple-bough.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then some people came into the room, and, among them, the&#10;young countess,&#8212;the lady who had placed the apple-bough in the&#10;transparent vase, so pleasantly beneath the rays of the sunlight.&#10;She carried in her hand something that seemed like a flower. The&#10;object was hidden by two or three great leaves, which covered it&#10;like a shield, so that no draught or gust of wind could injure it,&#10;and it was carried more carefully than the apple-branch had ever&#10;been. Very cautiously the large leaves were removed, and there&#10;appeared the feathery seed-crown of the despised dandelion. This&#10;was what the lady had so carefully plucked, and carried home so&#10;safely covered, so that not one of the delicate feathery arrows of&#10;which its mist-like shape was so lightly formed, should flutter&#10;away. She now drew it forth quite uninjured, and wondered at its&#10;beautiful form, and airy lightness, and singular construction, so&#10;soon to be blown away by the wind.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;See,&#34; she exclaimed, &#34;how wonderfully God has made this&#10;little flower. I will paint it with the apple-branch together.&#10;Every one admires the beauty of the apple-bough; but this humble&#10;flower has been endowed by Heaven with another kind of loveliness;&#10;and although they differ in appearance, both are the children of&#10;the realms of beauty.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the sunbeam kissed the lowly flower, and he kissed&#10;the blooming apple-branch, upon whose leaves appeared a rosy blush.&#10;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode(''), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;THERE was once a sculptor, named Alfred, who having won&#10;the large gold medal and obtained a travelling scholarship, went to&#10;Italy, and then came back to his native land. He was young at that&#10;time&#8212;indeed, he is young still, although he is ten years older than&#10;he was then. On his return, he went to visit one of the little&#10;towns in the island of Zealand. The whole town knew who the&#10;stranger was; and one of the richest men in the place gave a party&#10;in his honor, and all who were of any consequence, or who possessed&#10;some property, were invited. It was quite an event, and all the&#10;town knew of it, so that it was not necessary to announce it by&#10;beat of drum. Apprentice-boys, children of the poor, and even the&#10;poor people themselves, stood before the house, watching the&#10;lighted windows; and the watchman might easily fancy he was giving&#10;a party also, there were so many people in the streets. There was&#10;quite an air of festivity about it, and the house was full of it;&#10;for Mr. Alfred, the sculptor, was there. He talked and told&#10;anecdotes, and every one listened to him with pleasure, not&#10;unmingled with awe; but none felt so much respect for him as did&#10;the elderly widow of a naval officer. She seemed, so far as Mr.&#10;Alfred was concerned, to be like a piece of fresh blotting-paper&#10;that absorbed all he said and asked for more. She was very&#10;appreciative, and incredibly ignorant&#8212;a kind of female Gaspar&#10;Hauser.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I should like to see Rome,&#34; she said; &#34;it must be a&#10;lovely city, or so many foreigners would not be constantly arriving&#10;there. Now, do give me a description of Rome. How does the city&#10;look when you enter in at the gate?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I cannot very well describe it,&#34; said the sculptor; &#34;but&#10;you enter on a large open space, in the centre of which stands an&#10;obelisk, which is a thousand years old.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;An organist!&#34; exclaimed the lady, who had never heard the&#10;word &#39;obelisk.&#39; Several of the guests could scarcely forbear&#10;laughing, and the sculptor would have had some difficulty in&#10;keeping his countenance, but the smile on his lips faded away; for&#10;he caught sight of a pair of dark-blue eyes close by the side of&#10;the inquisitive lady. They belonged to her daughter; and surely no&#10;one who had such a daughter could be silly. The mother was like a&#10;fountain of questions; and the daughter, who listened but never&#10;spoke, might have passed for the beautiful maid of the fountain.&#10;How charming she was! She was a study for the sculptor to&#10;contemplate, but not to converse with; for she did not speak, or,&#10;at least, very seldom.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Has the pope a great family?&#34; inquired the&#10;lady.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The young man answered considerately, as if the question&#10;had been a different one, &#34;No; he does not come from a great&#10;family.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That is not what I asked,&#34; persisted the widow; &#34;I mean,&#10;has he a wife and children?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The pope is not allowed to marry,&#34; replied the&#10;gentleman.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I don&#39;t like that,&#34; was the lady&#39;s remark.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;She certainly might have asked more sensible questions;&#10;but if she had not been allowed to say just what she liked, would&#10;her daughter have been there, leaning so gracefully on her&#10;shoulder, and looking straight before her, with a smile that was&#10;almost mournful on her face?&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Mr. Alfred again spoke of Italy, and of the glorious&#10;colors in Italian scenery; the purple hills, the deep blue of the&#10;Mediterranean, the azure of southern skies, whose brightness and&#10;glory could only be surpassed in the north by the deep-blue eyes of&#10;a maiden; and he said this with a peculiar intonation; but she who&#10;should have understood his meaning looked quite unconscious of it,&#10;which also was charming.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Beautiful Italy!&#34; sighed some of the guests.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, to travel there!&#34; exclaimed others.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Charming! Charming!&#34; echoed from every voice.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I may perhaps win a hundred thousand dollars in the&#10;lottery,&#34; said the naval officer&#39;s widow; &#34;and if I do, we will&#10;travel&#8212;I and my daughter; and you, Mr. Alfred, must be our guide.&#10;We can all three travel together, with one or two more of our good&#10;friends.&#34; And she nodded in such a friendly way at the company,&#10;that each imagined himself to be the favored person who was to&#10;accompany them to Italy. &#34;Yes, we must go,&#34; she continued; &#34;but not&#10;to those parts where there are robbers. We will keep to Rome. In&#10;the public roads one is always safe.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The daughter sighed very gently; and how much there may be&#10;in a sigh, or attributed to it! The young man attributed a great&#10;deal of meaning to this sigh. Those deep-blue eyes, which had been&#10;lit up this evening in honor of him, must conceal treasures,&#10;treasures of heart and mind, richer than all the glories of Rome;&#10;and so when he left the party that night, he had lost it completely&#10;to the young lady. The house of the naval officer&#39;s widow was the&#10;one most constantly visited by Mr. Alfred, the sculptor. It was&#10;soon understood that his visits were not intended for that lady,&#10;though they were the persons who kept up the conversation. He came&#10;for the sake of the daughter. They called her Kaela. Her name was&#10;really Karen Malena, and these two names had been contracted into&#10;the one name Kaela. She was really beautiful; but some said she was&#10;rather dull, and slept late of a morning.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;She has been accustomed to that,&#34; her mother said. &#34;She&#10;is a beauty, and they are always easily tired. She does sleep&#10;rather late; but that makes her eyes so clear.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;What power seemed to lie in the depths of those dark eyes!&#10;The young man felt the truth of the proverb, &#34;Still waters run&#10;deep:&#34; and his heart had sunk into their depths. He often talked of&#10;his adventures, and the mamma was as simple and eager in her&#10;questions as on the first evening they met. It was a pleasure to&#10;hear Alfred describe anything. He showed them colored plates of&#10;Naples, and spoke of excursions to Mount Vesuvius, and the&#10;eruptions of fire from it. The naval officer&#39;s widow had never&#10;heard of them before.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Good heavens!&#34; she exclaimed. &#34;So that is a burning&#10;mountain; but is it not very dangerous to the people who live near&#10;it?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Whole cities have been destroyed,&#34; he replied; &#34;for&#10;instance, Herculaneum and Pompeii.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, the poor people! And you saw all that with your own&#10;eyes?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No; I did not see any of the eruptions which are&#10;represented in those pictures; but I will show you a sketch of my&#10;own, which represents an eruption I once saw.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;He placed a pencil sketch on the table; and mamma, who had&#10;been over-powered with the appearance of the colored plates, threw&#10;a glance at the pale drawing and cried in astonishment, &#34;What, did&#10;you see it throw up white fire?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;For a moment, Alfred&#39;s respect for Kaela&#39;s mamma underwent&#10;a sudden shock, and lessened considerably; but, dazzled by the&#10;light which surrounded Kaela, he soon found it quite natural that&#10;the old lady should have no eye for color. After all, it was of&#10;very little consequence; for Kaela&#39;s mamma had the best of all&#10;possessions; namely, Kaela herself.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Alfred and Kaela were betrothed, which was a very natural&#10;result; and the betrothal was announced in the newspaper of the&#10;little town. Mama purchased thirty copies of the paper, that she&#10;might cut out the paragraph and send it to friends and&#10;acquaintances. The betrothed pair were very happy, and the mother&#10;was happy too. She said it seemed like connecting herself with&#10;Thorwalsden.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You are a true successor of Thorwalsden,&#34; she said to&#10;Alfred; and it seemed to him as if, in this instance, mamma had&#10;said a clever thing. Kaela was silent; but her eyes shone, her lips&#10;smiled, every movement was graceful,&#8212;in fact, she was beautiful;&#10;that cannot be repeated too often. Alfred decided to take a bust of&#10;Kaela as well as of her mother. They sat to him accordingly, and&#10;saw how he moulded and formed the soft clay with his&#10;fingers.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I suppose it is only on our account that you perform this&#10;common-place work yourself, instead of leaving it to your servant&#10;to do all that sticking together.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It is really necessary that I should mould the clay&#10;myself,&#34; he replied.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ah, yes, you are always so polite,&#34; said mamma, with a&#10;smile; and Kaela silently pressed his hand, all soiled as it was&#10;with the clay.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then he unfolded to them both the beauties of Nature, in&#10;all her works; he pointed out to them how, in the scale of&#10;creation, inanimate matter was inferior to animate nature; the&#10;plant above the mineral, the animal above the plant, and man above&#10;them all. He strove to show them how the beauty of the mind could&#10;be displayed in the outward form, and that it was the sculptor&#39;s&#10;task to seize upon that beauty of expression, and produce it in his&#10;works. Kaela stood silent, but nodded in approbation of what he&#10;said, while mamma-in-law made the following confession:&#8212;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It is difficult to follow you; but I go hobbling along&#10;after you with my thoughts, though what you say makes my head whirl&#10;round and round. Still I contrive to lay hold on some of&#10;it.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Kaela&#39;s beauty had a firm hold on Alfred; it filled his&#10;soul, and held a mastery over him. Beauty beamed from Kaela&#39;s every&#10;feature, glittered in her eyes, lurked in the corners of her mouth,&#10;and pervaded every movement of her agile fingers. Alfred, the&#10;sculptor, saw this. He spoke only to her, thought only of her, and&#10;the two became one; and so it may be said she spoke much, for he&#10;was always talking to her; and he and she were one. Such was the&#10;betrothal, and then came the wedding, with bride&#39;s-maids and&#10;wedding presents, all duly mentioned in the wedding speech.&#10;Mamma-in-law had set up Thorwalsden&#39;s bust at the end of the table,&#10;attired in a dressing-gown; it was her fancy that he should be a&#10;guest. Songs were sung, and cheers given; for it was a gay wedding,&#10;and they were a handsome pair. &#34;Pygmalion loved his Galatea,&#34; said&#10;one of the songs.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ah, that is some of your mythologies,&#34; said&#10;mamma-in-law.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Next day the youthful pair started for Copenhagen, where&#10;they were to live; mamma-in-law accompanied them, to attend to the&#10;&#34;coarse work,&#34; as she always called the domestic arrangements.&#10;Kaela looked like a doll in a doll&#39;s house, for everything was&#10;bright and new, and so fine. There they sat, all three; and as for&#10;Alfred, a proverb may describe his position&#8212;he looked like a swan&#10;amongst the geese. The magic of form had enchanted him; he had&#10;looked at the casket without caring to inquire what it contained,&#10;and that omission often brings the greatest unhappiness into&#10;married life. The casket may be injured, the gilding may fall off,&#10;and then the purchaser regrets his bargain.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In a large party it is very disagreeable to find a button&#10;giving way, with no studs at hand to fall back upon; but it is&#10;worse still in a large company to be conscious that your wife and&#10;mother-in-law are talking nonsense, and that you cannot depend upon&#10;yourself to produce a little ready wit to carry off the stupidity&#10;of the whole affair.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The young married pair often sat together hand in hand; he&#10;would talk, but she could only now and then let fall a word in the&#10;same melodious voice, the same bell-like tones. It was a mental&#10;relief when Sophy, one of her friends, came to pay them a visit.&#10;Sophy was not, pretty. She was, however, quite free from any&#10;physical deformity, although Kaela used to say she was a little&#10;crooked; but no eye, save an intimate acquaintance, would have&#10;noticed it. She was a very sensible girl, yet it never occurred to&#10;her that she might be a dangerous person in such a house. Her&#10;appearance created a new atmosphere in the doll&#39;s house, and air&#10;was really required, they all owned that. They felt the want of a&#10;change of air, and consequently the young couple and their mother&#10;travelled to Italy.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Thank heaven we are at home again within our own four&#10;walls,&#34; said mamma-in-law and daughter both, on their return after&#10;a year&#39;s absence.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;There is no real pleasure in travelling,&#34; said mamma; &#34;to&#10;tell the truth, it&#39;s very wearisome; I beg pardon for saying so. I&#10;was soon very tired of it, although I had my children with me; and,&#10;besides, it&#39;s very expensive work travelling, very expensive. And&#10;all those galleries one is expected to see, and the quantity of&#10;things you are obliged to run after! It must be done, for very&#10;shame; you are sure to be asked when you come back if you have seen&#10;everything, and will most likely be told that you&#39;ve omitted to see&#10;what was best worth seeing of all. I got tired at last of those&#10;endless Madonnas; I began to think I was turning into a Madonna&#10;myself.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And then the living, mamma,&#34; said Kaela.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, indeed,&#34; she replied, &#34;no such a thing as a&#10;respectable meat soup&#8212;their cookery is miserable stuff.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The journey had also tired Kaela; but she was always&#10;fatigued, that was the worst of it. So they sent for Sophy, and she&#10;was taken into the house to reside with them, and her presence&#10;there was a great advantage. Mamma-in-law acknowledged that Sophy&#10;was not only a clever housewife, but well-informed and&#10;accomplished, though that could hardly be expected in a person of&#10;her limited means. She was also a generous-hearted, faithful girl;&#10;she showed that thoroughly while Kaela lay sick, fading away. When&#10;the casket is everything, the casket should be strong, or else all&#10;is over. And all was over with the casket, for Kaela&#10;died.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;She was beautiful,&#34; said her mother; &#34;she was quite&#10;different from the beauties they call &#39;antiques,&#39; for they are so&#10;damaged. A beauty ought to be perfect, and Kaela was a perfect&#10;beauty.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Alfred wept, and mamma wept, and they both wore mourning.&#10;The black dress suited mamma very well, and she wore mourning the&#10;longest. She had also to experience another grief in seeing Alfred&#10;marry again, marry Sophy, who was nothing at all to look at. &#34;He&#39;s&#10;gone to the very extreme,&#34; said mamma-in-law; &#34;he has gone from the&#10;most beautiful to the ugliest, and he has forgotten his first wife.&#10;Men have no constancy. My husband was a very different man,&#8212;but&#10;then he died before me.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;Pygmalion loved his Galatea,&#39; was in the song they sung&#10;at my first wedding,&#34; said Alfred; &#34;I once fell in love with a&#10;beautiful statue, which awoke to life in my arms; but the kindred&#10;soul, which is a gift from heaven, the angel who can feel and&#10;sympathize with and elevate us, I have not found and won till now.&#10;You came, Sophy, not in the glory of outward beauty, though you are&#10;even fairer than is necessary. The chief thing still remains. You&#10;came to teach the sculptor that his work is but dust and clay only,&#10;an outward form made of a material that decays, and that what we&#10;should seek to obtain is the ethereal essence of mind and spirit.&#10;Poor Kaela! our life was but as a meeting by the way-side; in&#10;yonder world, where we shall know each other from a union of mind,&#10;we shall be but mere acquaintances.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That was not a loving speech,&#34; said Sophy, &#34;nor spoken&#10;like a Christian. In a future state, where there is neither&#10;marrying nor giving in marriage, but where, as you say, souls are&#10;attracted to each other by sympathy; there everything beautiful&#10;develops itself, and is raised to a higher state of existence: her&#10;soul will acquire such completeness that it may harmonize with&#10;yours, even more than mine, and you will then once more utter your&#10;first rapturous exclamation of your love, &#39;Beautiful, most&#10;beautiful!&#39;&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode(''), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;THERE was once an Emperor who had a horse shod with gold.&#10;He had a golden shoe on each foot, and why was this? He was a&#10;beautiful creature, with slender legs, bright, intelligent eyes,&#10;and a mane that hung down over his neck like a veil. He had carried&#10;his master through fire and smoke in the battle-field, with the&#10;bullets whistling round him; he had kicked and bitten, and taken&#10;part in the fight, when the enemy advanced; and, with his master on&#10;his back, he had dashed over the fallen foe, and saved the golden&#10;crown and the Emperor&#39;s life, which was of more value than the&#10;brightest gold. This is the reason of the Emperor&#39;s horse wearing&#10;golden shoes.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A beetle came creeping forth from the stable, where the&#10;farrier had been shoeing the horse. &#34;Great ones, first, of course,&#34;&#10;said he, &#34;and then the little ones; but size is not always a proof&#10;of greatness.&#34; He stretched out his thin leg as he&#10;spoke.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And pray what do you want?&#34; asked the farrier.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Golden shoes,&#34; replied the beetle.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Why, you must be out of your senses,&#34; cried the farrier.&#10;&#34;Golden shoes for you, indeed!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, certainly; golden shoes,&#34; replied the beetle. &#34;Am I&#10;not just as good as that great creature yonder, who is waited upon&#10;and brushed, and has food and drink placed before him? And don&#39;t I&#10;belong to the royal stables?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But why does the horse have golden shoes?&#34; asked the&#10;farrier; &#34;of course you understand the reason?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Understand! Well, I understand that it is a personal&#10;slight to me,&#34; cried the beetle. &#34;It is done to annoy me, so I&#10;intend to go out into the world and seek my fortune.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Go along with you,&#34; said the farrier.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You&#39;re a rude fellow,&#34; cried the beetle, as he walked out&#10;of the stable; and then he flew for a short distance, till he found&#10;himself in a beautiful flower-garden, all fragrant with roses and&#10;lavender. The lady-birds, with red and black shells on their backs,&#10;and delicate wings, were flying about, and one of them said, &#34;Is it&#10;not sweet and lovely here? Oh, how beautiful everything&#10;is.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I am accustomed to better things,&#34; said the beetle. &#34;Do&#10;you call this beautiful? Why, there is not even a dung-heap.&#34; Then&#10;he went on, and under the shadow of a large haystack he found a&#10;caterpillar crawling along. &#34;How beautiful this world is!&#34; said the&#10;caterpillar. &#34;The sun is so warm, I quite enjoy it. And soon I&#10;shall go to sleep, and die as they call it, but I shall wake up&#10;with beautiful wings to fly with, like a butterfly.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;How conceited you are!&#34; exclaimed the beetle. &#34;Fly about&#10;as a butterfly, indeed! what of that. I have come out of the&#10;Emperor&#39;s stable, and no one there, not even the Emperor&#39;s horse,&#10;who, in fact, wears my cast-off golden shoes, has any idea of&#10;flying, excepting myself. To have wings and fly! why, I can do that&#10;already;&#34; and so saying, he spread his wings and flew away. &#34;I&#10;don&#39;t want to be disgusted,&#34; he said to himself, &#34;and yet I can&#39;t&#10;help it.&#34; Soon after, he fell down upon an extensive lawn, and for&#10;a time pretended to sleep, but at last fell asleep in earnest.&#10;Suddenly a heavy shower of rain came falling from the clouds. The&#10;beetle woke up with the noise and would have been glad to creep&#10;into the earth for shelter, but he could not. He was tumbled over&#10;and over with the rain, sometimes swimming on his stomach and&#10;sometimes on his back; and as for flying, that was out of the&#10;question. He began to doubt whether he should escape with his life,&#10;so he remained, quietly lying where he was. After a while the&#10;weather cleared up a little, and the beetle was able to rub the&#10;water from his eyes, and look about him. He saw something gleaming,&#10;and he managed to make his way up to it. It was linen which had&#10;been laid to bleach on the grass. He crept into a fold of the damp&#10;linen, which certainly was not so comfortable a place to lie in as&#10;the warm stable, but there was nothing better, so he remained lying&#10;there for a whole day and night, and the rain kept on all the time.&#10;Towards morning he crept out of his hiding-place, feeling in a very&#10;bad temper with the climate. Two frogs were sitting on the linen,&#10;and their bright eyes actually glistened with pleasure.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Wonderful weather this,&#34; cried one of them, &#34;and so&#10;refreshing. This linen holds the water together so beautifully,&#10;that my hind legs quiver as if I were going to swim.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I should like to know,&#34; said another, &#34;If the swallow who&#10;flies so far in her many journeys to foreign lands, ever met with a&#10;better climate than this. What delicious moisture! It is as&#10;pleasant as lying in a wet ditch. I am sure any one who does not&#10;enjoy this has no love for his fatherland.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Have you ever been in the Emperor&#39;s stable?&#34; asked the&#10;beetle. &#34;There the moisture is warm and refreshing; that&#39;s the&#10;climate for me, but I could not take it with me on my travels. Is&#10;there not even a dunghill here in this garden, where a person of&#10;rank, like myself, could take up his abode and feel at home?&#34; But&#10;the frogs either did not or would not understand him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I never ask a question twice,&#34; said the beetle, after he&#10;had asked this one three times, and received no answer. Then he&#10;went on a little farther and stumbled against a piece of broken&#10;crockery-ware, which certainly ought not to have been lying there.&#10;But as it was there, it formed a good shelter against wind and&#10;weather to several families of earwigs who dwelt in it. Their&#10;requirements were not many, they were very sociable, and full of&#10;affection for their children, so much so that each mother&#10;considered her own child the most beautiful and clever of them&#10;all.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Our dear son has engaged himself,&#34; said one mother, &#34;dear&#10;innocent boy; his greatest ambition is that he may one day creep&#10;into a clergyman&#39;s ear. That is a very artless and loveable wish;&#10;and being engaged will keep him steady. What happiness for a&#10;mother!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Our son,&#34; said another, &#34;had scarcely crept out of the&#10;egg, when he was off on his travels. He is all life and spirits, I&#10;expect he will wear out his horns with running. How charming this&#10;is for a mother, is it not Mr. Beetle?&#34; for she knew the stranger&#10;by his horny coat.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You are both quite right,&#34; said he; so they begged him to&#10;walk in, that is to come as far as he could under the broken piece&#10;of earthenware.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Now you shall also see my little earwigs,&#34; said a third&#10;and a fourth mother, &#34;they are lovely little things, and highly&#10;amusing. They are never ill-behaved, except when they are&#10;uncomfortable in their inside, which unfortunately often happens at&#10;their age.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Thus each mother spoke of her baby, and their babies&#10;talked after their own fashion, and made use of the little nippers&#10;they have in their tails to nip the beard of the beetle.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;They are always busy about something, the little rogues,&#34;&#10;said the mother, beaming with maternal pride; but the beetle felt&#10;it a bore, and he therefore inquired the way to the nearest&#10;dung-heap.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That is quite out in the great world, on the other side&#10;of the ditch,&#34; answered an earwig, &#34;I hope none of my children will&#10;ever go so far, it would be the death of me.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But I shall try to get so far,&#34; said the beetle, and he&#10;walked off without taking any formal leave, which is considered a&#10;polite thing to do.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;When he arrived at the ditch, he met several friends, all&#10;them beetles; &#34;We live here,&#34; they said, &#34;and we are very&#10;comfortable. May we ask you to step down into this rich mud, you&#10;must be fatigued after your journey.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Certainly,&#34; said the beetle, &#34;I shall be most happy; I&#10;have been exposed to the rain, and have had to lie upon linen, and&#10;cleanliness is a thing that greatly exhausts me; I have also pains&#10;in one of my wings from standing in the draught under a piece of&#10;broken crockery. It is really quite refreshing to be with one&#39;s own&#10;kindred again.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Perhaps you came from a dung-heap,&#34; observed the oldest&#10;of them.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No, indeed, I came from a much grander place,&#34; replied&#10;the beetle; &#34;I came from the emperor&#39;s stable, where I was born,&#10;with golden shoes on my feet. I am travelling on a secret embassy,&#10;but you must not ask me any questions, for I cannot betray my&#10;secret.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the beetle stepped down into the rich mud, where sat&#10;three young-lady beetles, who tittered, because they did not know&#10;what to say.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;None of them are engaged yet,&#34; said their mother, and the&#10;beetle maidens tittered again, this time quite in&#10;confusion.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I have never seen greater beauties, even in the royal&#10;stables,&#34; exclaimed the beetle, who was now resting&#10;himself.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Don&#39;t spoil my girls,&#34; said the mother; &#34;and don&#39;t talk&#10;to them, pray, unless you have serious intentions.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But of course the beetle&#39;s intentions were serious, and&#10;after a while our friend was engaged. The mother gave them her&#10;blessing, and all the other beetles cried &#34;hurrah.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Immediately after the betrothal came the marriage, for&#10;there was no reason to delay. The following day passed very&#10;pleasantly, and the next was tolerably comfortable; but on the&#10;third it became necessary for him to think of getting food for his&#10;wife, and, perhaps, for children.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I have allowed myself to be taken in,&#34; said our beetle to&#10;himself, &#34;and now there&#39;s nothing to be done but to take them in,&#10;in return.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;No sooner said than done. Away he went, and stayed away&#10;all day and all night, and his wife remained behind a forsaken&#10;widow.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh,&#34; said the other beetles, &#34;this fellow that we have&#10;received into our family is nothing but a complete vagabond. He has&#10;gone away and left his wife a burden upon our hands.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Well, she can be unmarried again, and remain here with my&#10;other daughters,&#34; said the mother. &#34;Fie on the villain that forsook&#10;her!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the mean time the beetle, who had sailed across the&#10;ditch on a cabbage leaf, had been journeying on the other side. In&#10;the morning two persons came up to the ditch. When they saw him&#10;they took him up and turned him over and over, looking very learned&#10;all the time, especially one, who was a boy. &#34;Allah sees the black&#10;beetle in the black stone, and the black rock. Is not that written&#10;in the Koran?&#34; he asked.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then he translated the beetle&#39;s name into Latin, and said&#10;a great deal upon the creature&#39;s nature and history. The second&#10;person, who was older and a scholar, proposed to carry the beetle&#10;home, as they wanted just such good specimens as this. Our beetle&#10;considered this speech a great insult, so he flew suddenly out of&#10;the speaker&#39;s hand. His wings were dry now, so they carried him to&#10;a great distance, till at last he reached a hothouse, where a sash&#10;of the glass roof was partly open, so he quietly slipped in and&#10;buried himself in the warm earth. &#34;It is very comfortable here,&#34; he&#10;said to himself, and soon after fell asleep. Then he dreamed that&#10;the emperor&#39;s horse was dying, and had left him his golden shoes,&#10;and also promised that he should have two more. All this was very&#10;delightful, and when the beetle woke up he crept forth and looked&#10;around him. What a splendid place the hothouse was! At the back,&#10;large palm-trees were growing; and the sunlight made the&#10;leaves&#8212;look quite glossy; and beneath them what a profusion of&#10;luxuriant green, and of flowers red like flame, yellow as amber, or&#10;white as new-fallen snow! &#34;What a wonderful quantity of plants,&#34;&#10;cried the beetle; &#34;how good they will taste when they are decayed!&#10;This is a capital store-room. There must certainly be some&#10;relations of mine living here; I will just see if I can find any&#10;one with whom I can associate. I&#39;m proud, certainly; but I&#39;m also&#10;proud of being so. Then he prowled about in the earth, and thought&#10;what a pleasant dream that was about the dying horse, and the&#10;golden shoes he had inherited. Suddenly a hand seized the beetle,&#10;and squeezed him, and turned him round and round. The gardener&#39;s&#10;little son and his playfellow had come into the hothouse, and,&#10;seeing the beetle, wanted to have some fun with him. First, he was&#10;wrapped, in a vine-leaf, and put into a warm trousers&#39; pocket. He&#10;twisted and turned about with all his might, but he got a good&#10;squeeze from the boy&#39;s hand, as a hint for him to keep quiet. Then&#10;the boy went quickly towards a lake that lay at the end of the&#10;garden. Here the beetle was put into an old broken wooden shoe, in&#10;which a little stick had been fastened upright for a mast, and to&#10;this mast the beetle was bound with a piece of worsted. Now he was&#10;a sailor, and had to sail away. The lake was not very large, but to&#10;the beetle it seemed an ocean, and he was so astonished at its size&#10;that he fell over on his back, and kicked out his legs. Then the&#10;little ship sailed away; sometimes the current of the water seized&#10;it, but whenever it went too far from the shore one of the boys&#10;turned up his trousers, and went in after it, and brought it back&#10;to land. But at last, just as it went merrily out again, the two&#10;boys were called, and so angrily, that they hastened to obey, and&#10;ran away as fast as they could from the pond, so that the little&#10;ship was left to its fate. It was carried away farther and farther&#10;from the shore, till it reached the open sea. This was a terrible&#10;prospect for the beetle, for he could not escape in consequence of&#10;being bound to the mast. Then a fly came and paid him a visit.&#10;&#34;What beautiful weather,&#34; said the fly; &#34;I shall rest here and sun&#10;myself. You must have a pleasant time of it.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You speak without knowing the facts,&#34; replied the beetle;&#10;&#34;don&#39;t you see that I am a prisoner?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ah, but I&#39;m not a prisoner,&#34; remarked the fly, and away&#10;he flew.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Well, now I know the world,&#34; said the beetle to himself;&#10;&#34;it&#39;s an abominable world; I&#39;m the only respectable person in it.&#10;First, they refuse me my golden shoes; then I have to lie on damp&#10;linen, and to stand in a draught; and to crown all, they fasten a&#10;wife upon me. Then, when I have made a step forward in the world,&#10;and found out a comfortable position, just as I could wish it to&#10;be, one of these human boys comes and ties me up, and leaves me to&#10;the mercy of the wild waves, while the emperor&#39;s favorite horse&#10;goes prancing about proudly on his golden shoes. This vexes me more&#10;than anything. But it is useless to look for sympathy in this&#10;world. My career has been very interesting, but what&#39;s the use of&#10;that if nobody knows anything about it? The world does not deserve&#10;to be made acquainted with my adventures, for it ought to have&#10;given me golden shoes when the emperor&#39;s horse was shod, and I&#10;stretched out my feet to be shod, too. If I had received golden&#10;shoes I should have been an ornament to the stable; now I am lost&#10;to the stable and to the world. It is all over with me.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But all was not yet over. A boat, in which were a few&#10;young girls, came rowing up. &#34;Look, yonder is an old wooden shoe&#10;sailing along,&#34; said one of the younger girls.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And there&#39;s a poor little creature bound fast in it,&#34;&#10;said another.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The boat now came close to our beetle&#39;s ship, and the&#10;young girls fished it out of the water. One of them drew a small&#10;pair of scissors from her pocket, and cut the worsted without&#10;hurting the beetle, and when she stepped on shore she placed him on&#10;the grass. &#34;There,&#34; she said, &#34;creep away, or fly, if thou canst.&#10;It is a splendid thing to have thy liberty.&#34; Away flew the beetle,&#10;straight through the open window of a large building; there he sank&#10;down, tired and exhausted, exactly on the mane of the emperor&#39;s&#10;favorite horse, who was standing in his stable; and the beetle&#10;found himself at home again. For some time he clung to the mane,&#10;that he might recover himself. &#34;Well,&#34; he said, &#34;here I am, seated&#10;on the emperor&#39;s favorite horse,&#8212;sitting upon him as if I were the&#10;emperor himself. But what was it the farrier asked me? Ah, I&#10;remember now,&#8212;that&#39;s a good thought,&#8212;he asked me why the golden&#10;shoes were given to the horse. The answer is quite clear to me,&#10;now. They were given to the horse on my account.&#34; And this&#10;reflection put the beetle into a good temper. The sun&#39;s rays also&#10;came streaming into the stable, and shone upon him, and made the&#10;place lively and bright. &#34;Travelling expands the mind very much,&#34;&#10;said the beetle. &#34;The world is not so bad after all, if you know&#10;how to take things as they come. &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode(''), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;IN the narrow streets of a large town people often heard&#10;in the evening, when the sun was setting, and his last rays gave a&#10;golden tint to the chimney-pots, a strange noise which resembled&#10;the sound of a church bell; it only lasted an instant, for it was&#10;lost in the continual roar of traffic and hum of voices which rose&#10;from the town. &#34;The evening bell is ringing,&#34; people used to say;&#10;&#34;the sun is setting!&#34; Those who walked outside the town, where the&#10;houses were less crowded and interspersed by gardens and little&#10;fields, saw the evening sky much better, and heard the sound of the&#10;bell much more clearly. It seemed as though the sound came from a&#10;church, deep in the calm, fragrant wood, and thither people looked&#10;with devout feelings.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A considerable time elapsed: one said to the other, &#34;I&#10;really wonder if there is a church out in the wood. The bell has&#10;indeed a strange sweet sound! Shall we go there and see what the&#10;cause of it is?&#34; The rich drove, the poor walked, but the way&#10;seemed to them extraordinarily long, and when they arrived at a&#10;number of willow trees on the border of the wood they sat down,&#10;looked up into the great branches and thought they were now really&#10;in the wood. A confectioner from the town also came out and put up&#10;a stall there; then came another confectioner who hung a bell over&#10;his stall, which was covered with pitch to protect it from the&#10;rain, but the clapper was wanting.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;When people came home they used to say that it had been&#10;very romantic, and that really means something else than merely&#10;taking tea. Three persons declared that they had gone as far as the&#10;end of the wood; they had always heard the strange sound, but there&#10;it seemed to them as if it came from the town. One of them wrote&#10;verses about the bell, and said that it was like the voice of a&#10;mother speaking to an intelligent and beloved child; no tune, he&#10;said, was sweeter than the sound of the bell.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The emperor of the country heard of it, and declared that&#10;he who would really find out where the sound came from should&#10;receive the title of &#34;Bellringer to the World,&#34; even if there was&#10;no bell at all.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Now many went out into the wood for the sake of this&#10;splendid berth; but only one of them came back with some sort of&#10;explanation. None of them had gone far enough, nor had he, and yet&#10;he said that the sound of the bell came from a large owl in a&#10;hollow tree. It was a wisdom owl, which continually knocked its&#10;head against the tree, but he was unable to say with certainty&#10;whether its head or the hollow trunk of the tree was the cause of&#10;the noise.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;He was appointed &#34;Bellringer to the World,&#34; and wrote&#10;every year a short dissertation on the owl, but by this means&#10;people did not become any wiser than they had been&#10;before.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was just confirmation-day. The clergyman had delivered&#10;a beautiful and touching sermon, the candidates were deeply moved&#10;by it; it was indeed a very important day for them; they were all&#10;at once transformed from mere children to grown-up people; the&#10;childish soul was to fly over, as it were, into a more reasonable&#10;being.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The sun shone most brightly; and the sound of the great&#10;unknown bell was heard more distinctly than ever. They had a mind&#10;to go thither, all except three. One of them wished to go home and&#10;try on her ball dress, for this very dress and the ball were the&#10;cause of her being confirmed this time, otherwise she would not&#10;have been allowed to go. The second, a poor boy, had borrowed a&#10;coat and a pair of boots from the son of his landlord to be&#10;confirmed in, and he had to return them at a certain time. The&#10;third said that he never went into strange places if his parents&#10;were not with him; he had always been a good child, and wished to&#10;remain so, even after being confirmed, and they ought not to tease&#10;him for this; they, however, did it all the same. These three,&#10;therefore did not go; the others went on. The sun was shining, the&#10;birds were singing, and the confirmed children sang too, holding&#10;each other by the hand, for they had no position yet, and they were&#10;all equal in the eyes of God. Two of the smallest soon became tired&#10;and returned to the town; two little girls sat down and made&#10;garlands of flowers, they, therefore, did not go on. When the&#10;others arrived at the willow trees, where the confectioner had put&#10;up his stall, they said: &#34;Now we are out here; the bell does not in&#10;reality exist&#8212;it is only something that people imagine!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then suddenly the sound of the bell was heard so&#10;beautifully and solemnly from the wood that four or five made up&#10;their minds to go still further on. The wood was very thickly&#10;grown. It was difficult to advance: wood lilies and anemones grew&#10;almost too high; flowering convolvuli and brambles were hanging&#10;like garlands from tree to tree; while the nightingales were&#10;singing and the sunbeams played. That was very beautiful! But the&#10;way was unfit for the girls; they would have torn their dresses.&#10;Large rocks, covered with moss of various hues, were lying about;&#10;the fresh spring water rippled forth with a peculiar sound. &#34;I&#10;don&#39;t think that can be the bell,&#34; said one of the confirmed&#10;children, and then he lay down and listened. &#34;We must try to find&#10;out if it is!&#34; And there he remained, and let the others walk&#10;on.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;They came to a hut built of the bark of trees and&#10;branches; a large crab-apple tree spread its branches over it, as&#10;if it intended to pour all its fruit on the roof, upon which roses&#10;were blooming; the long boughs covered the gable, where a little&#10;bell was hanging. Was this the one they had heard? All agreed that&#10;it must be so, except one who said that the bell was too small and&#10;too thin to be heard at such a distance, and that it had quite a&#10;different sound to that which had so touched men&#39;s&#10;hearts.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;He who spoke was a king&#39;s son, and therefore the others&#10;said that such a one always wishes to be cleverer than other&#10;people.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Therefore they let him go alone; and as he walked on, the&#10;solitude of the wood produced a feeling of reverence in his breast;&#10;but still he heard the little bell about which the others rejoiced,&#10;and sometimes, when the wind blew in that direction, he could hear&#10;the sounds from the confectioner&#39;s stall, where the others were&#10;singing at tea. But the deep sounds of the bell were much stronger;&#10;soon it seemed to him as if an organ played an accompaniment&#8212;the&#10;sound came from the left, from the side where the heart is. Now&#10;something rustled among the bushes, and a little boy stood before&#10;the king&#39;s son, in wooden shoes and such a short jacket that the&#10;sleeves did not reach to his wrists. They knew each other: the boy&#10;was the one who had not been able to go with them because he had to&#10;take the coat and boots back to his landlord&#39;s son. That he had&#10;done, and had started again in his wooden shoes and old clothes,&#10;for the sound of the bell was too enticing&#8212;he felt he must go&#10;on.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;We might go together,&#34; said the king&#39;s son. But the poor&#10;boy with the wooden shoes was quite ashamed; he pulled at the short&#10;sleeves of his jacket, and said that he was afraid he could not&#10;walk so fast; besides, he was of opinion that the bell ought to be&#10;sought at the right, for there was all that was grand and&#10;magnificent.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Then we shall not meet,&#34; said the king&#39;s son, nodding to&#10;the poor boy, who went into the deepest part of the wood, where the&#10;thorns tore his shabby clothes and scratched his hands, face, and&#10;feet until they bled. The king&#39;s son also received several good&#10;scratches, but the sun was shining on his way, and it is he whom we&#10;will now follow, for he was a quick fellow. &#34;I will and must find&#10;the bell,&#34; he said, &#34;if I have to go to the end of the&#10;world.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Ugly monkeys sat high in the branches and clenched their&#10;teeth. &#34;Shall we beat him?&#34; they said. &#34;Shall we thrash him? He is&#10;a king&#39;s son!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But he walked on undaunted, deeper and deeper into the&#10;wood, where the most wonderful flowers were growing; there were&#10;standing white star lilies with blood-red stamens, sky-blue tulips&#10;shining when the wind moved them; apple-trees covered with apples&#10;like large glittering soap bubbles: only think how resplendent&#10;these trees were in the sunshine! All around were beautiful green&#10;meadows, where hart and hind played in the grass. There grew&#10;magnificent oaks and beech-trees; and if the bark was split of any&#10;of them, long blades of grass grew out of the clefts; there were&#10;also large smooth lakes in the wood, on which the swans were&#10;swimming about and flapping their wings. The king&#39;s son often stood&#10;still and listened; sometimes he thought that the sound of the bell&#10;rose up to him out of one of these deep lakes, but soon he found&#10;that this was a mistake, and that the bell was ringing still&#10;farther in the wood. Then the sun set, the clouds were as red as&#10;fire; it became quiet in the wood; he sank down on his knees, sang&#10;an evening hymn and said: &#34;I shall never find what I am looking&#10;for! Now the sun is setting, and the night, the dark night, is&#10;approaching. Yet I may perhaps see the round sun once more before&#10;he disappears beneath the horizon. I will climb up these rocks,&#10;they are as high as the highest trees!&#34; And then, taking hold of&#10;the creepers and roots, he climbed up on the wet stones, where&#10;water-snakes were wriggling and the toads, as it were, barked at&#10;him: he reached the top before the sun, seen from such a height,&#10;had quite set. &#34;Oh, what a splendour!&#34; The sea, the great majestic&#10;sea, which was rolling its long waves against the shore, stretched&#10;out before him, and the sun was standing like a large bright altar&#10;and there where sea and heaven met&#8212;all melted together in the most&#10;glowing colours; the wood was singing, and his heart too. The whole&#10;of nature was one large holy church, in which the trees and&#10;hovering clouds formed the pillars, the flowers and grass the woven&#10;velvet carpet, and heaven itself was the great cupola; up there the&#10;flame colour vanished as soon as the sun disappeared, but millions&#10;of stars were lighted; diamond lamps were shining, and the king&#39;s&#10;son stretched his arms out towards heaven, towards the sea, and&#10;towards the wood. Then suddenly the poor boy with the short-sleeved&#10;jacket and the wooden shoes appeared; he had arrived just as&#10;quickly on the road he had chosen. And they ran towards each other&#10;and took one another&#39;s hand, in the great cathedral of nature and&#10;poesy, and above them sounded the invisible holy bell; happy&#10;spirits surrounded them, singing hallelujahs and rejoicing.&#10;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode(''), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;DING-DONG! ding-dong!&#34; It sounds up from the &#34;bell-deep&#34;&#10;in the Odense-Au. Every child in the old town of Odense, on the&#10;island of Funen, knows the Au, which washes the gardens round about&#10;the town, and flows on under the wooden bridges from the dam to the&#10;water-mill. In the Au grow the yellow water-lilies and brown&#10;feathery reeds; the dark velvety flag grows there, high and thick;&#10;old and decayed willows, slanting and tottering, hang far out over&#10;the stream beside the monk&#39;s meadow and by the bleaching ground;&#10;but opposite there are gardens upon gardens, each different from&#10;the rest, some with pretty flowers and bowers like little dolls&#39;&#10;pleasure grounds, often displaying cabbage and other kitchen&#10;plants; and here and there the gardens cannot be seen at all, for&#10;the great elder trees that spread themselves out by the bank, and&#10;hang far out over the streaming waters, which are deeper here and&#10;there than an oar can fathom. Opposite the old nunnery is the&#10;deepest place, which is called the &#34;bell-deep,&#34; and there dwells&#10;the old water spirit, the &#34;Au-mann.&#34; This spirit sleeps through the&#10;day while the sun shines down upon the water; but in starry and&#10;moonlit nights he shows himself. He is very old. Grandmother says&#10;that she has heard her own grandmother tell of him; he is said to&#10;lead a solitary life, and to have nobody with whom he can converse&#10;save the great old church Bell. Once the Bell hung in the church&#10;tower; but now there is no trace left of the tower or of the&#10;church, which was called St. Alban&#39;s.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ding-dong! ding-dong!&#34; sounded the Bell, when the tower&#10;still stood there; and one evening, while the sun was setting, and&#10;the Bell was swinging away bravely, it broke loose and came flying&#10;down through the air, the brilliant metal shining in the ruddy&#10;beam.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ding-dong! ding-dong! Now I&#39;ll retire to rest!&#34; sang the&#10;Bell, and flew down into the Odense-Au, where it is deepest; and&#10;that is why the place is called the &#34;bell-deep.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But the Bell got neither rest nor sleep. Down in the&#10;Au-mann&#39;s haunt it sounds and rings, so that the tones sometimes&#10;pierce upward through the waters; and many people maintain that its&#10;strains forebode the death of some one; but that is not true, for&#10;the Bell is only talking with the Au-mann, who is now no longer&#10;alone.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And what is the Bell telling? It is old, very old, as we&#10;have already observed; it was there long before grandmother&#39;s&#10;grandmother was born; and yet it is but a child in comparison with&#10;the Au-mann, who is quite an old quiet personage, an oddity, with&#10;his hose of eel-skin, and his scaly Jacket with the yellow lilies&#10;for buttons, and a wreath of reed in his hair and seaweed in his&#10;beard; but he looks very pretty for all that.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;What the Bell tells? To repeat it all would require years&#10;and days; for year by year it is telling the old stories, sometimes&#10;short ones, sometimes long ones, according to its whim; it tells of&#10;old times, of the dark hard times, thus:&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;In the church of St. Alban, the monk had mounted up into&#10;the tower. He was young and handsome, but thoughtful exceedingly.&#10;He looked through the loophole out upon the Odense-Au, when the bed&#10;of the water was yet broad, and the monks&#39; meadow was still a lake.&#10;He looked out over it, and over the rampart, and over the nuns&#39;&#10;hill opposite, where the convent lay, and the light gleamed forth&#10;from the nun&#39;s cell. He had known the nun right well, and he&#10;thought of her, and his heart beat quicker as he thought.&#10;Ding-dong! ding-dong!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Yes, this was the story the Bell told.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Into the tower came also the dapper man-servant of the&#10;bishop; and when I, the Bell, who am made of metal, rang hard and&#10;loud, and swung to and fro, I might have beaten out his brains. He&#10;sat down close under me, and played with two little sticks as if&#10;they had been a stringed instrument; and he sang to it. &#39;Now I may&#10;sing it out aloud, though at other times I may not whisper it. I&#10;may sing of everything that is kept concealed behind lock and bars.&#10;Yonder it is cold and wet. The rats are eating her up alive! Nobody&#10;knows of it! Nobody hears of it! Not even now, for the bell is&#10;ringing and singing its loud Ding-dong, ding-dong!&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;There was a King in those days. They called him Canute.&#10;He bowed himself before bishop and monk; but when he offended the&#10;free peasants with heavy taxes and hard words, they seized their&#10;weapons and put him to flight like a wild beast. He sought shelter&#10;in the church, and shut gate and door behind him. The violent band&#10;surrounded the church; I heard tell of it. The crows, ravens and&#10;magpies started up in terror at the yelling and shouting that&#10;sounded around. They flew into the tower and out again, they looked&#10;down upon the throng below, and they also looked into the windows&#10;of the church, and screamed out aloud what they saw there. King&#10;Canute knelt before the altar in prayer; his brothers Eric and&#10;Benedict stood by him as a guard with drawn swords; but the King&#39;s&#10;servant, the treacherous Blake, betrayed his master. The throng in&#10;front of the church knew where they could hit the King, and one of&#10;them flung a stone through a pane of glass, and the King lay there&#10;dead! The cries and screams of the savage horde and of the birds&#10;sounded through the air, and I joined in it also; for I sang&#10;&#39;Ding-dong! ding-dong!&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The church bell hangs high, and looks far around, and&#10;sees the birds around it, and understands their language. The wind&#10;roars in upon it through windows and loopholes; and the wind knows&#10;everything, for he gets it from the air, which encircles all&#10;things, and the church bell understands his tongue, and rings it&#10;out into the world, &#39;Ding-dong! ding-dong!&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But it was too much for me to hear and to know; I was not&#10;able any longer to ring it out. I became so tired, so heavy, that&#10;the beam broke, and I flew out into the gleaming Au, where the&#10;water is deepest, and where the Au-mann lives, solitary and alone;&#10;and year by year I tell him what I have heard and what I know.&#10;Ding-dong! ding-dong&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Thus it sounds complainingly out of the bell-deep in the&#10;Odense-Au. That is what grandmother told us.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But the schoolmaster says that there was not any bell that&#10;rung down there, for that it could not do so; and that no Au-mann&#10;dwelt yonder, for there was no Au-mann at all! And when all the&#10;other church bells are sounding sweetly, he says that it is not&#10;really the bells that are sounding, but that it is the air itself&#10;which sends forth the notes; and grandmother said to us that the&#10;Bell itself said it was the air who told it to him, consequently&#10;they are agreed on that point, and this much is sure.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Be cautious, cautious, and take good heed to thyself,&#34;&#10;they both say.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The air knows everything. It is around us, it is in us, it&#10;talks of our thoughts and of our deeds, and it speaks longer of&#10;them than does the Bell down in the depths of the Odense-Au where&#10;the Au-mann dwells.

It rolls and thunders with a sound that&#10;penetrates for miles into the land; and we are quite near the&#10;roaring. Before us rises a great mound of sand&#8212;a mountain we have&#10;long seen, and towards which we are wending our way, driving slowly&#10;along through the deep sand. On this mountain of sand is a lofty&#10;old building&#8212;the convent of Borglum. In one of its wings (the&#10;larger one) there is still a church. And at this convent we now&#10;arrive in the late evening hour; but the weather is clear in the&#10;bright June night around us, and the eye can range far, far over&#10;field and moor to the Bay of Aalborg, over heath and meadow, and&#10;far across the deep blue sea.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Now we are there, and roll past between barns and other&#10;farm buildings; and at the left of the gate we turn aside to the&#10;Old Castle Farm, where the lime trees stand in lines along the&#10;walls, and, sheltered from the wind and weather, grow so&#10;luxuriantly that their twigs and leaves almost conceal the&#10;windows.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;We mount the winding staircase of stone, and march through&#10;the long passages under the heavy roof-beams. The wind moans very&#10;strangely here, both within and without. It is hardly known how,&#10;but the people say&#8212;yes, people say a great many things when they&#10;are frightened or want to frighten others&#8212;they say that the old&#10;dead choir-men glide silently past us into the church, where mass&#10;is sung. They can be heard in the rushing of the storm, and their&#10;singing brings up strange thoughts in the hearers&#8212;thoughts of the&#10;old times into which we are carried back.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;On the coast a ship is stranded; and the bishop&#39;s warriors&#10;are there, and spare not those whom the sea has spared. The sea&#10;washes away the blood that has flowed from the cloven skulls. The&#10;stranded goods belong to the bishop, and there is a store of goods&#10;here. The sea casts up tubs and barrels filled with costly wine for&#10;the convent cellar, and in the convent is already good store of&#10;beer and mead. There is plenty in the kitchen&#8212;dead game and&#10;poultry, hams and sausages; and fat fish swim in the ponds&#10;without.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Bishop of Borglum is a mighty lord. He has great&#10;possessions, but still he longs for more&#8212;everything must bow before&#10;the mighty Olaf Glob. His rich cousin at Thyland is dead, and his&#10;widow is to have the rich inheritance. But how comes it that one&#10;relation is always harder towards another than even strangers would&#10;be? The widow&#39;s husband had possessed all Thyland, with the&#10;exception of the church property. Her son was not at home. In his&#10;boyhood he had already started on a journey, for his desire was to&#10;see foreign lands and strange people. For years there had been no&#10;news of him. Perhaps he had been long laid in the grave, and would&#10;never come back to his home, to rule where his mother then&#10;ruled.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What has a woman to do with rule?&#34; said the&#10;bishop.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;He summoned the widow before a law court; but what did he&#10;gain thereby? The widow had never been disobedient to the law, and&#10;was strong in her just rights.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Bishop Olaf of Borglum, what dost thou purpose? What&#10;writest thou on yonder smooth parchment, sealing it with thy seal,&#10;and intrusting it to the horsemen and servants, who ride away, far&#10;away, to the city of the Pope?&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It is the time of falling leaves and of stranded ships,&#10;and soon icy winter will come.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Twice had icy winter returned before the bishop welcomed&#10;the horsemen and servants back to their home. They came from Rome&#10;with a papal decree&#8212;a ban, or bull, against the widow who had dared&#10;to offend the pious bishop. &#34;Cursed be she and all that belongs to&#10;her. Let her be expelled from the congregation and the Church. Let&#10;no man stretch forth a helping hand to her, and let friends and&#10;relations avoid her as a plague and a pestilence!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What will not bend must break,&#34; said the Bishop of&#10;Borglum&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And all forsake the widow; but she holds fast to her God.&#10;He is her helper and defender.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;One servant only&#8212;an old maid&#8212;remained faithful to her; and&#10;with the old servant, the widow herself followed the plough; and&#10;the crop grew, although the land had been cursed by the Pope and by&#10;the bishop.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Thou child of perdition, I will yet carry out my&#10;purpose!&#34; cried the Bishop of Borglum. &#34;Now will I lay the hand of&#10;the Pope upon thee, to summon thee before the tribunal that shall&#10;condemn thee!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then did the widow yoke the last two oxen that remained to&#10;her to a wagon, and mounted up on the wagon, with her old servant,&#10;and travelled away across the heath out of the Danish land. As a&#10;stranger she came into a foreign country, where a strange tongue&#10;was spoken and where new customs prevailed. Farther and farther she&#10;journeyed, to where green hills rise into mountains, and the vine&#10;clothes their sides. Strange merchants drive by her, and they look&#10;anxiously after their wagons laden with merchandise. They fear an&#10;attack from the armed followers of the robber-knights. The two poor&#10;women, in their humble vehicle drawn by two black oxen, travel&#10;fearlessly through the dangerous sunken road and through the&#10;darksome forest. And now they were in Franconia. And there met them&#10;a stalwart knight, with a train of twelve armed followers. He&#10;paused, gazed at the strange vehicle, and questioned the women as&#10;to the goal of their journey and the place whence they came. Then&#10;one of them mentioned Thyland in Denmark, and spoke of her sorrows,&#10;of her woes, which were soon to cease, for so Divine Providence had&#10;willed it. For the stranger knight is the widow&#39;s son! He seized&#10;her hand, he embraced her, and the mother wept. For years she had&#10;not been able to weep, but had only bitten her lips till the blood&#10;started.&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It is the time of falling leaves and of stranded ships,&#10;and soon will icy winter come.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The sea rolled wine-tubs to the shore for the bishop&#39;s&#10;cellar. In the kitchen the deer roasted on the spit before the&#10;fire. At Borglum it was warm and cheerful in the heated rooms,&#10;while cold winter raged without, when a piece of news was brought&#10;to the bishop. &#34;Jens Glob, of Thyland, has come back, and his&#10;mother with him.&#34; Jens Glob laid a complaint against the bishop,&#10;and summoned him before the temporal and the spiritual&#10;court.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That will avail him little,&#34; said the bishop. &#34;Best leave&#10;off thy efforts, knight Jens.&#34;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Again it is the time of falling leaves and stranded ships.&#10;Icy winter comes again, and the &#34;white bees&#34; are swarming, and&#10;sting the traveller&#39;s face till they melt.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Keen weather to-day!&#34; say the people, as they step&#10;in.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Jens Glob stands so deeply wrapped in thought, that he&#10;singes the skirt of his wide garment.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Thou Borglum bishop,&#34; he exclaims, &#34;I shall subdue thee&#10;after all! Under the shield of the Pope, the law cannot reach thee;&#10;but Jens Glob shall reach thee!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then he writes a letter to his brother-in-law, Olaf Hase,&#10;in Sallingland, and prays that knight to meet him on Christmas eve,&#10;at mass, in the church at Widberg. The bishop himself is to read&#10;the mass, and consequently will journey from Borglum to Thyland;&#10;and this is known to Jens Glob.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Moorland and meadow are covered with ice and snow. The&#10;marsh will bear horse and rider, the bishop with his priests and&#10;armed men. They ride the shortest way, through the waving reeds,&#10;where the wind moans sadly.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Blow thy brazen trumpet, thou trumpeter clad in fox-skin!&#10;it sounds merrily in the clear air. So they ride on over heath and&#10;moorland&#8212;over what is the garden of Fata Morgana in the hot summer,&#10;though now icy, like all the country&#8212;towards the church of&#10;Widberg.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The wind is blowing his trumpet too&#8212;blowing it harder and&#10;harder. He blows up a storm&#8212;a terrible storm&#8212;that increases more&#10;and more. Towards the church they ride, as fast as they may through&#10;the storm. The church stands firm, but the storm careers on over&#10;field and moorland, over land and sea.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Borglum&#39;s bishop reaches the church; but Olaf Hase will&#10;scarce do so, however hard he may ride. He journeys with his&#10;warriors on the farther side of the bay, in order that he may help&#10;Jens Glob, now that the bishop is to be summoned before the&#10;judgment seat of the Highest.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The church is the judgment hall; the altar is the council&#10;table. The lights burn clear in the heavy brass candelabra. The&#10;storm reads out the accusation and the sentence, roaming in the air&#10;over moor and heath, and over the rolling waters. No ferry-boat can&#10;sail over the bay in such weather as this.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Olaf Hase makes halt at Ottesworde. There he dismisses his&#10;warriors, presents them with their horses and harness, and gives&#10;them leave to ride home and greet his wife. He intends to risk his&#10;life alone in the roaring waters; but they are to bear witness for&#10;him that it is not his fault if Jens Glob stands without&#10;reinforcement in the church at Widberg. The faithful warriors will&#10;not leave him, but follow him out into the deep waters. Ten of them&#10;are carried away; but Olaf Hase and two of the youngest men reach&#10;the farther side. They have still four miles to ride.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It is past midnight. It is Christmas. The wind has abated.&#10;The church is lighted up; the gleaming radiance shines through the&#10;window-frames, and pours out over meadow and heath. The mass has&#10;long been finished, silence reigns in the church, and the wax is&#10;heard dropping from the candles to the stone pavement. And now Olaf&#10;Hase arrives.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the forecourt Jens Glob greets him kindly, and&#10;says,&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I have just made an agreement with the&#10;bishop.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Sayest thou so?&#34; replied Olaf Hase. &#34;Then neither thou&#10;nor the bishop shall quit this church alive.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the sword leaps from the scabbard, and Olaf Hase deals&#10;a blow that makes the panel of the church door, which Jens Glob&#10;hastily closes between them, fly in fragments.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Hold, brother! First hear what the agreement was that I&#10;made. I have slain the bishop and his warriors and priests. They&#10;will have no word more to say in the matter, nor will I speak again&#10;of all the wrong that my mother has endured.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The long wicks of the altar lights glimmer red; but there&#10;is a redder gleam upon the pavement, where the bishop lies with&#10;cloven skull, and his dead warriors around him, in the quiet of the&#10;holy Christmas night.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And four days afterwards the bells toll for a funeral in&#10;the convent of Borglum. The murdered bishop and the slain warriors&#10;and priests are displayed under a black canopy, surrounded by&#10;candelabra decked with crape. There lies the dead man, in the black&#10;cloak wrought with silver; the crozier in the powerless hand that&#10;was once so mighty. The incense rises in clouds, and the monks&#10;chant the funeral hymn. It sounds like a wail&#8212;it sounds like a&#10;sentence of wrath and condemnation, that must be heard far over the&#10;land, carried by the wind&#8212;sung by the wind&#8212;the wail that sometimes&#10;is silent, but never dies; for ever again it rises in song, singing&#10;even into our own time this legend of the Bishop of Borglum and his&#10;hard nephew. It is heard in the dark night by the frightened&#10;husbandman, driving by in the heavy sandy road past the convent of&#10;Borglum. It is heard by the sleepless listener in the&#10;thickly-walled rooms at Borglum. And not only to the ear of&#10;superstition is the sighing and the tread of hurrying feet audible&#10;in the long echoing passages leading to the convent door that has&#10;long been locked. The door still seems to open, and the lights seem&#10;to flame in the brazen candlesticks; the fragrance of incense&#10;arises; the church gleams in its ancient splendor; and the monks&#10;sing and say the mass over the slain bishop, who lies there in the&#10;black silver-embroidered mantle, with the crozier in his powerless&#10;hand; and on his pale proud forehead gleams the red wound like&#10;fire, and there burn the worldly mind and the wicked&#10;thoughts.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Sink down into his grave&#8212;into oblivion&#8212;ye terrible shapes&#10;of the times of old!&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Hark to the raging of the angry wind, sounding above the&#10;rolling sea! A storm approaches without, calling aloud for human&#10;lives. The sea has not put on a new mind with the new time. This&#10;night it is a horrible pit to devour up lives, and to-morrow,&#10;perhaps, it may be a glassy mirror&#8212;even as in the old time that we&#10;have buried. Sleep sweetly, if thou canst sleep!&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Now it is morning.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The new time flings sunshine into the room. The wind still&#10;keeps up mightily. A wreck is announced&#8212;as in the old&#10;time.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;During the night, down yonder by Lokken, the little&#10;fishing village with the red-tiled roofs&#8212;we can see it up here from&#10;the window&#8212;a ship has come ashore. It has struck, and is fast&#10;embedded in the sand; but the rocket apparatus has thrown a rope on&#10;board, and formed a bridge from the wreck to the mainland; and all&#10;on board are saved, and reach the land, and are wrapped in warm&#10;blankets; and to-day they are invited to the farm at the convent of&#10;Borglum. In comfortable rooms they encounter hospitality and&#10;friendly faces. They are addressed in the language of their&#10;country, and the piano sounds for them with melodies of their&#10;native land; and before these have died away, the chord has been&#10;struck, the wire of thought that reaches to the land of the&#10;sufferers announces that they are rescued. Then their anxieties are&#10;dispelled; and at even they join in the dance at the feast given in&#10;the great hall at Borglum. Waltzes and Styrian dances are given,&#10;and Danish popular songs, and melodies of foreign lands in these&#10;modern times.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Blessed be thou, new time! Speak thou of summer and of&#10;purer gales! Send thy sunbeams gleaming into our hearts and&#10;thoughts! On thy glowing canvas let them be painted&#8212;the dark&#10;legends of the rough hard times that are past! &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode(''), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;CLOSE to the corner of a street, among other abodes of&#10;poverty, stood an exceedingly tall, narrow house, which had been so&#10;knocked about by time that it seemed out of joint in every&#10;direction. This house was inhabited by poor people, but the deepest&#10;poverty was apparent in the garret lodging in the gable. In front&#10;of the little window, an old bent bird-cage hung in the sunshine,&#10;which had not even a proper water-glass, but instead of it the&#10;broken neck of a bottle, turned upside down, and a cork stuck in to&#10;make it hold the water with which it was filled. An old maid stood&#10;at the window; she had hung chickweed over the cage, and the little&#10;linnet which it contained hopped from perch to perch and sang and&#10;twittered merrily.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, it&#39;s all very well for you to sing,&#34; said the bottle&#10;neck: that is, he did not really speak the words as we do, for the&#10;neck of a bottle cannot speak; but he thought them to himself in&#10;his own mind, just as people sometimes talk quietly to&#10;themselves.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, you may sing very well, you have all your limbs&#10;uninjured; you should feel what it is like to lose your body, and&#10;only have a neck and a mouth left, with a cork stuck in it, as I&#10;have: you wouldn&#39;t sing then, I know. After all, it is just as well&#10;that there are some who can be happy. I have no reason to sing, nor&#10;could I sing now if I were ever so happy; but when I was a whole&#10;bottle, and they rubbed me with a cork, didn&#39;t I sing then? I used&#10;to be called a complete lark. I remember when I went out to a&#10;picnic with the furrier&#39;s family, on the day his daughter was&#10;betrothed,&#8212;it seems as if it only happened yesterday. I have gone&#10;through a great deal in my time, when I come to recollect: I have&#10;been in the fire and in the water, I have been deep in the earth,&#10;and have mounted higher in the air than most other people, and now&#10;I am swinging here, outside a bird-cage, in the air and the&#10;sunshine. Oh, indeed, it would be worth while to hear my history;&#10;but I do not speak it aloud, for a good reason&#8212;because I&#10;cannot.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the bottle neck related his history, which was really&#10;rather remarkable; he, in fact, related it to himself, or, at&#10;least, thought it in his own mind. The little bird sang his own&#10;song merrily; in the street below there was driving and running to&#10;and fro, every one thought of his own affairs, or perhaps of&#10;nothing at all; but the bottle neck thought deeply. He thought of&#10;the blazing furnace in the factory, where he had been blown into&#10;life; he remembered how hot it felt when he was placed in the&#10;heated oven, the home from which he sprang, and that he had a&#10;strong inclination to leap out again directly; but after a while it&#10;became cooler, and he found himself very comfortable. He had been&#10;placed in a row, with a whole regiment of his brothers and sisters&#10;all brought out of the same furnace; some of them had certainly&#10;been blown into champagne bottles, and others into beer bottles,&#10;which made a little difference between them. In the world it often&#10;happens that a beer bottle may contain the most precious wine, and&#10;a champagne bottle be filled with blacking, but even in decay it&#10;may always be seen whether a man has been well born. Nobility&#10;remains noble, as a champagne bottle remains the same, even with&#10;blacking in its interior. When the bottles were packed our bottle&#10;was packed amongst them; it little expected then to finish its&#10;career as a bottle neck, or to be used as a water-glass to a&#10;bird&#39;s-cage, which is, after all, a place of honor, for it is to be&#10;of some use in the world. The bottle did not behold the light of&#10;day again, until it was unpacked with the rest in the wine&#10;merchant&#39;s cellar, and, for the first time, rinsed with water,&#10;which caused some very curious sensations. There it lay empty, and&#10;without a cork, and it had a peculiar feeling, as if it wanted&#10;something it knew not what. At last it was filled with rich and&#10;costly wine, a cork was placed in it, and sealed down. Then it was&#10;labelled &#34;first quality,&#34; as if it had carried off the first prize&#10;at an examination; besides, the wine and the bottle were both good,&#10;and while we are young is the time for poetry. There were sounds of&#10;song within the bottle, of things it could not understand, of green&#10;sunny mountains, where the vines grow and where the merry&#10;vine-dressers laugh, sing, and are merry. &#34;Ah, how beautiful is&#10;life.&#34; All these tones of joy and song in the bottle were like the&#10;working of a young poet&#39;s brain, who often knows not the meaning of&#10;the tones which are sounding within him. One morning the bottle&#10;found a purchaser in the furrier&#39;s apprentice, who was told to&#10;bring one of the best bottles of wine. It was placed in the&#10;provision basket with ham and cheese and sausages. The sweetest&#10;fresh butter and the finest bread were put into the basket by the&#10;furrier&#39;s daughter herself, for she packed it. She was young and&#10;pretty; her brown eyes laughed, and a smile lingered round her&#10;mouth as sweet as that in her eyes. She had delicate hands,&#10;beautifully white, and her neck was whiter still. It could easily&#10;be seen that she was a very lovely girl, and as yet she was not&#10;engaged. The provision basket lay in the lap of the young girl as&#10;the family drove out to the forest, and the neck of the bottle&#10;peeped out from between the folds of the white napkin. There was&#10;the red wax on the cork, and the bottle looked straight at the&#10;young girl&#39;s face, and also at the face of the young sailor who sat&#10;near her. He was a young friend, the son of a portrait painter. He&#10;had lately passed his examination with honor, as mate, and the next&#10;morning he was to sail in his ship to a distant coast. There had&#10;been a great deal of talk on this subject while the basket was&#10;being packed, and during this conversation the eyes and the mouth&#10;of the furrier&#39;s daughter did not wear a very joyful expression.&#10;The young people wandered away into the green wood, and talked&#10;together. What did they talk about? The bottle could not say, for&#10;he was in the provision basket. It remained there a long time; but&#10;when at last it was brought forth it appeared as if something&#10;pleasant had happened, for every one was laughing; the furrier&#39;s&#10;daughter laughed too, but she said very little, and her cheeks were&#10;like two roses. Then her father took the bottle and the cork-screw&#10;into his hands. What a strange sensation it was to have the cork&#10;drawn for the first time! The bottle could never after that forget&#10;the performance of that moment; indeed there was quite a convulsion&#10;within him as the cork flew out, and a gurgling sound as the wine&#10;was poured forth into the glasses.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Long life to the betrothed,&#34; cried the papa, and every&#10;glass was emptied to the dregs, while the young sailor kissed his&#10;beautiful bride.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Happiness and blessing to you both,&#34; said the old&#10;people-father and mother, and the young man filled the glasses&#10;again.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Safe return, and a wedding this day next year,&#34; he cried;&#10;and when the glasses were empty he took the bottle, raised it on&#10;high, and said, &#34;Thou hast been present here on the happiest day of&#10;my life; thou shalt never be used by others!&#34; So saying, he hurled&#10;it high in the air.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The furrier&#39;s daughter thought she should never see it&#10;again, but she was mistaken. It fell among the rushes on the&#10;borders of a little woodland lake. The bottle neck remembered well&#10;how long it lay there unseen. &#34;I gave them wine, and they gave me&#10;muddy water,&#34; he had said to himself, &#34;but I suppose it was all&#10;well meant.&#34; He could no longer see the betrothed couple, nor the&#10;cheerful old people; but for a long time he could hear them&#10;rejoicing and singing. At length there came by two peasant boys,&#10;who peeped in among the reeds and spied out the bottle. Then they&#10;took it up and carried it home with them, so that once more it was&#10;provided for. At home in their wooden cottage these boys had an&#10;elder brother, a sailor, who was about to start on a long voyage.&#10;He had been there the day before to say farewell, and his mother&#10;was now very busy packing up various things for him to take with&#10;him on his voyage. In the evening his father was going to carry the&#10;parcel to the town to see his son once more, and take him a&#10;farewell greeting from his mother. A small bottle had already been&#10;filled with herb tea, mixed with brandy, and wrapped in a parcel;&#10;but when the boys came in they brought with them a larger and&#10;stronger bottle, which they had found. This bottle would hold so&#10;much more than the little one, and they all said the brandy would&#10;be so good for complaints of the stomach, especially as it was&#10;mixed with medical herbs. The liquid which they now poured into the&#10;bottle was not like the red wine with which it had once been&#10;filled; these were bitter drops, but they are of great use&#10;sometimes-for the stomach. The new large bottle was to go, not the&#10;little one: so the bottle once more started on its travels. It was&#10;taken on board (for Peter Jensen was one of the crew) the very same&#10;ship in which the young mate was to sail. But the mate did not see&#10;the bottle: indeed, if he had he would not have known it, or&#10;supposed it was the one out of which they had drunk to the felicity&#10;of the betrothed and to the prospect of a marriage on his own happy&#10;return. Certainly the bottle no longer poured forth wine, but it&#10;contained something quite as good; and so it happened that whenever&#10;Peter Jensen brought it out, his messmates gave it the name of &#34;the&#10;apothecary,&#34; for it contained the best medicine to cure the&#10;stomach, and he gave it out quite willingly as long as a drop&#10;remained. Those were happy days, and the bottle would sing when&#10;rubbed with a cork, and it was called a great lark,&#34; &#34;Peter&#10;Jensen&#39;s lark.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Long days and months rolled by, during which the bottle&#10;stood empty in a corner, when a storm arose&#8212;whether on the passage&#10;out or home it could not tell, for it had never been ashore. It was&#10;a terrible storm, great waves arose, darkly heaving and tossing the&#10;vessel to and fro. The main mast was split asunder, the ship sprang&#10;a leak, and the pumps became useless, while all around was black as&#10;night. At the last moment, when the ship was sinking, the young&#10;mate wrote on a piece of paper, &#34;We are going down: God&#39;s will be&#10;done.&#34; Then he wrote the name of his betrothed, his own name, and&#10;that of the ship. Then he put the leaf in an empty bottle that&#10;happened to be at hand, corked it down tightly, and threw it into&#10;the foaming sea. He knew not that it was the very same bottle from&#10;which the goblet of joy and hope had once been filled for him, and&#10;now it was tossing on the waves with his last greeting, and a&#10;message from the dead. The ship sank, and the crew sank with her;&#10;but the bottle flew on like a bird, for it bore within it a loving&#10;letter from a loving heart. And as the sun rose and set, the bottle&#10;felt as at the time of its first existence, when in the heated&#10;glowing stove it had a longing to fly away. It outlived the storms&#10;and the calm, it struck against no rocks, was not devoured by&#10;sharks, but drifted on for more than a year, sometimes towards the&#10;north, sometimes towards the south, just as the current carried it.&#10;It was in all other ways its own master, but even of that one may&#10;get tired. The written leaf, the last farewell of the bridegroom to&#10;his bride, would only bring sorrow when once it reached her hands;&#10;but where were those hands, so soft and delicate, which had once&#10;spread the table-cloth on the fresh grass in the green wood, on the&#10;day of her betrothal? Ah, yes! where was the furrier&#39;s daughter?&#10;and where was the land which might lie nearest to her&#10;home?&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The bottle knew not, it travelled onward and onward, and&#10;at last all this wandering about became wearisome; at all events it&#10;was not its usual occupation. But it had to travel, till at length&#10;it reached land&#8212;a foreign country. Not a word spoken in this&#10;country could the bottle understand; it was a language it had never&#10;before heard, and it is a great loss not to be able to understand a&#10;language. The bottle was fished out of the water, and examined on&#10;all sides. The little letter contained within it was discovered,&#10;taken out, and turned and twisted in every direction; but the&#10;people could not understand what was written upon it. They could be&#10;quite sure that the bottle had been thrown overboard from a vessel,&#10;and that something about it was written on this paper: but what was&#10;written? that was the question,&#8212;so the paper was put back into the&#10;bottle, and then both were put away in a large cupboard of one of&#10;the great houses of the town. Whenever any strangers arrived, the&#10;paper was taken out and turned over and over, so that the address,&#10;which was only written in pencil, became almost illegible, and at&#10;last no one could distinguish any letters on it at all. For a whole&#10;year the bottle remained standing in the cupboard, and then it was&#10;taken up to the loft, where it soon became covered with dust and&#10;cobwebs. Ah! how often then it thought of those better days&#8212;of the&#10;times when in the fresh, green wood, it had poured forth rich wine;&#10;or, while rocked by the swelling waves, it had carried in its bosom&#10;a secret, a letter, a last parting sigh. For full twenty years it&#10;stood in the loft, and it might have stayed there longer but that&#10;the house was going to be rebuilt. The bottle was discovered when&#10;the roof was taken off; they talked about it, but the bottle did&#10;not understand what they said&#8212;a language is not to be learnt by&#10;living in a loft, even for twenty years. &#34;If I had been down stairs&#10;in the room,&#34; thought the bottle, &#34;I might have learnt it.&#34; It was&#10;now washed and rinsed, which process was really quite necessary,&#10;and afterwards it looked clean and transparent, and felt young&#10;again in its old age; but the paper which it had carried so&#10;faithfully was destroyed in the washing. They filled the bottle&#10;with seeds, though it scarcely knew what had been placed in it.&#10;Then they corked it down tightly, and carefully wrapped it up.&#10;There not even the light of a torch or lantern could reach it, much&#10;less the brightness of the sun or moon. &#34;And yet,&#34; thought the&#10;bottle, &#34;men go on a journey that they may see as much as possible,&#10;and I can see nothing.&#34; However, it did something quite as&#10;important; it travelled to the place of its destination, and was&#10;unpacked.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What trouble they have taken with that bottle over&#10;yonder!&#34; said one, and very likely it is broken after all.&#34; But the&#10;bottle was not broken, and, better still, it understood every word&#10;that was said: this language it had heard at the furnaces and at&#10;the wine merchant&#39;s; in the forest and on the ship,&#8212;it was the only&#10;good old language it could understand. It had returned home, and&#10;the language was as a welcome greeting. For very joy, it felt ready&#10;to jump out of people&#39;s hands, and scarcely noticed that its cork&#10;had been drawn, and its contents emptied out, till it found itself&#10;carried to a cellar, to be left there and forgotten. &#34;There&#39;s no&#10;place like home, even if it&#39;s a cellar.&#34; It never occurred to him&#10;to think that he might lie there for years, he felt so comfortable.&#10;For many long years he remained in the cellar, till at last some&#10;people came to carry away the bottles, and ours amongst the&#10;number.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Out in the garden there was a great festival. Brilliant&#10;lamps hung in festoons from tree to tree; and paper lanterns,&#10;through which the light shone till they looked like transparent&#10;tulips. It was a beautiful evening, and the weather mild and clear.&#10;The stars twinkled; and the new moon, in the form of a crescent,&#10;was surrounded by the shadowy disc of the whole moon, and looked&#10;like a gray globe with a golden rim: it was a beautiful sight for&#10;those who had good eyes. The illumination extended even to the most&#10;retired of the garden walks, at least not so retired that any one&#10;need lose himself there. In the borders were placed bottles, each&#10;containing a light, and among them the bottle with which we are&#10;acquainted, and whose fate it was, one day, to be only a bottle&#10;neck, and to serve as a water-glass to a bird&#39;s-cage. Everything&#10;here appeared lovely to our bottle, for it was again in the green&#10;wood, amid joy and feasting; again it heard music and song, and the&#10;noise and murmur of a crowd, especially in that part of the garden&#10;where the lamps blazed, and the paper lanterns displayed their&#10;brilliant colors. It stood in a distant walk certainly, but a place&#10;pleasant for contemplation; and it carried a light; and was at once&#10;useful and ornamental. In such an hour it is easy to forget that&#10;one has spent twenty years in a loft, and a good thing it is to be&#10;able to do so. Close before the bottle passed a single pair, like&#10;the bridal pair&#8212;the mate and the furrier&#39;s daughter&#8212;who had so long&#10;ago wandered in the wood. It seemed to the bottle as if he were&#10;living that time over again. Not only the guests but other people&#10;were walking in the garden, who were allowed to witness the&#10;splendor and the festivities. Among the latter came an old maid,&#10;who seemed to be quite alone in the world. She was thinking, like&#10;the bottle, of the green wood, and of a young betrothed pair, who&#10;were closely connected with herself; she was thinking of that hour,&#10;the happiest of her life, in which she had taken part, when she had&#10;herself been one of that betrothed pair; such hours are never to be&#10;forgotten, let a maiden be as old as she may. But she did not&#10;recognize the bottle, neither did the bottle notice the old maid.&#10;And so we often pass each other in the world when we meet, as did&#10;these two, even while together in the same town.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The bottle was taken from the garden, and again sent to a&#10;wine merchant, where it was once more filled with wine, and sold to&#10;an aeronaut, who was to make an ascent in his balloon on the&#10;following Sunday. A great crowd assembled to witness the sight;&#10;military music had been engaged, and many other preparations made.&#10;The bottle saw it all from the basket in which he lay close to a&#10;live rabbit. The rabbit was quite excited because he knew that he&#10;was to be taken up, and let down again in a parachute. The bottle,&#10;however, knew nothing of the &#34;up,&#34; or the &#34;down;&#34; he saw only that&#10;the balloon was swelling larger and larger till it could swell no&#10;more, and began to rise and be restless. Then the ropes which held&#10;it were cut through, and the aerial ship rose in the air with the&#10;aeronaut and the basket containing the bottle and the rabbit, while&#10;the music sounded and all the people shouted &#34;Hurrah.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;This is a wonderful journey up into the air,&#34; thought the&#10;bottle; &#34;it is a new way of sailing, and here, at least, there is&#10;no fear of striking against anything.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Thousands of people gazed at the balloon, and the old maid&#10;who was in the garden saw it also; for she stood at the open window&#10;of the garret, by which hung the cage containing the linnet, who&#10;then had no water-glass, but was obliged to be contented with an&#10;old cup. In the window-sill stood a myrtle in a pot, and this had&#10;been pushed a little on one side, that it might not fall out; for&#10;the old maid was leaning out of the window, that she might see. And&#10;she did see distinctly the aeronaut in the balloon, and how he let&#10;down the rabbit in the parachute, and then drank to the health of&#10;all the spectators in the wine from the bottle. After doing this,&#10;he hurled it high into the air. How little she thought that this&#10;was the very same bottle which her friend had thrown aloft in her&#10;honor, on that happy day of rejoicing, in the green wood, in her&#10;youthful days. The bottle had no time to think, when raised so&#10;suddenly; and before it was aware, it reached the highest point it&#10;had ever attained in its life. Steeples and roofs lay far, far&#10;beneath it, and the people looked as tiny as possible. Then it&#10;began to descend much more rapidly than the rabbit had done, made&#10;somersaults in the air, and felt itself quite young and unfettered,&#10;although it was half full of wine. But this did not last long. What&#10;a journey it was! All the people could see the bottle; for the sun&#10;shone upon it. The balloon was already far away, and very soon the&#10;bottle was far away also; for it fell upon a roof, and broke in&#10;pieces. But the pieces had got such an impetus in them, that they&#10;could not stop themselves. They went jumping and rolling about,&#10;till at last they fell into the court-yard, and were broken into&#10;still smaller pieces; only the neck of the bottle managed to keep&#10;whole, and it was broken off as clean as if it had been cut with a&#10;diamond.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That would make a capital bird&#39;s glass,&#34; said one of the&#10;cellar-men; but none of them had either a bird or a cage, and it&#10;was not to be expected they would provide one just because they had&#10;found a bottle neck that could be used as a glass. But the old maid&#10;who lived in the garret had a bird, and it really might be useful&#10;to her; so the bottle neck was provided with a cork, and taken up&#10;to her; and, as it often happens in life, the part that had been&#10;uppermost was now turned downwards, and it was filled with fresh&#10;water. Then they hung it in the cage of the little bird, who sang&#10;and twittered more merrily than ever.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ah, you have good reason to sing,&#34; said the bottle neck,&#10;which was looked upon as something very remarkable, because it had&#10;been in a balloon; nothing further was known of its history. As it&#10;hung there in the bird&#39;s-cage, it could hear the noise and murmur&#10;of the people in the street below, as well as the conversation of&#10;the old maid in the room within. An old friend had just come to&#10;visit her, and they talked, not about the bottle neck, but of the&#10;myrtle in the window.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No, you must not spend a dollar for your daughter&#39;s&#10;bridal bouquet,&#34; said the old maid; &#34;you shall have a beautiful&#10;little bunch for a nosegay, full of blossoms. Do you see how&#10;splendidly the tree has grown? It has been raised from only a&#10;little sprig of myrtle that you gave me on the day after my&#10;betrothal, and from which I was to make my own bridal bouquet when&#10;a year had passed: but that day never came; the eyes were closed&#10;which were to have been my light and joy through life. In the&#10;depths of the sea my beloved sleeps sweetly; the myrtle has become&#10;an old tree, and I am a still older woman. Before the sprig you&#10;gave me faded, I took a spray, and planted it in the earth; and&#10;now, as you see, it has become a large tree, and a bunch of the&#10;blossoms shall at last appear at a wedding festival, in the bouquet&#10;of your daughter.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;There were tears in the eyes of the old maid, as she spoke&#10;of the beloved of her youth, and of their betrothal in the wood.&#10;Many thoughts came into her mind; but the thought never came, that&#10;quite close to her, in that very window, was a remembrance of those&#10;olden times,&#8212;the neck of the bottle which had, as it were shouted&#10;for joy when the cork flew out with a bang on the betrothal day.&#10;But the bottle neck did not recognize the old maid; he had not been&#10;listening to what she had related, perhaps because he was thinking&#10;so much about her. &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode(''), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;VERY often, after a violent thunder-storm, a field of&#10;buckwheat appears blackened and singed, as if a flame of fire had&#10;passed over it. The country people say that this appearance is&#10;caused by lightning; but I will tell you what the sparrow says, and&#10;the sparrow heard it from an old willow-tree which grew near a&#10;field of buckwheat, and is there still. It is a large venerable&#10;tree, though a little crippled by age. The trunk has been split,&#10;and out of the crevice grass and brambles grow. The tree bends&#10;for-ward slightly, and the branches hang quite down to the ground&#10;just like green hair. Corn grows in the surrounding fields, not&#10;only rye and barley, but oats,-pretty oats that, when ripe, look&#10;like a number of little golden canary-birds sitting on a bough. The&#10;corn has a smiling look and the heaviest and richest ears bend&#10;their heads low as if in pious humility. Once there was also a&#10;field of buckwheat, and this field was exactly opposite to old&#10;willow-tree. The buckwheat did not bend like the other grain, but&#10;erected its head proudly and stiffly on the stem. &#34;I am as valuable&#10;as any other corn,&#34; said he, &#34;and I am much handsomer; my flowers&#10;are as beautiful as the bloom of the apple blossom, and it is a&#10;pleasure to look at us. Do you know of anything prettier than we&#10;are, you old willow-tree?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the willow-tree nodded his head, as if he would say,&#10;&#34;Indeed I do.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But the buckwheat spread itself out with pride, and said,&#10;&#34;Stupid tree; he is so old that grass grows out of his&#10;body.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;There arose a very terrible storm. All the field-flowers&#10;folded their leaves together, or bowed their little heads, while&#10;the storm passed over them, but the buckwheat stood erect in its&#10;pride. &#34;Bend your head as we do,&#34; said the flowers.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I have no occasion to do so,&#34; replied the&#10;buckwheat.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Bend your head as we do,&#34; cried the ears of corn; &#34;the&#10;angel of the storm is coming; his wings spread from the sky above&#10;to the earth beneath. He will strike you down before you can cry&#10;for mercy.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But I will not bend my head,&#34; said the&#10;buckwheat.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Close your flowers and bend your leaves,&#34; said the old&#10;willow-tree. &#34;Do not look at the lightning when the cloud bursts;&#10;even men cannot do that. In a flash of lightning heaven opens, and&#10;we can look in; but the sight will strike even human beings blind.&#10;What then must happen to us, who only grow out of the earth, and&#10;are so inferior to them, if we venture to do so?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Inferior, indeed!&#34; said the buckwheat. &#34;Now I intend to&#10;have a peep into heaven.&#34; Proudly and boldly he looked up, while&#10;the lightning flashed across the sky as if the whole world were in&#10;flames.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;When the dreadful storm had passed, the flowers and the&#10;corn raised their drooping heads in the pure still air, refreshed&#10;by the rain, but the buckwheat lay like a weed in the field, burnt&#10;to blackness by the lightning. The branches of the old willow-tree&#10;rustled in the wind, and large water-drops fell from his green&#10;leaves as if the old willow were weeping. Then the sparrows asked&#10;why he was weeping, when all around him seemed so cheerful. &#34;See,&#34;&#10;they said, how the sun shines, and the clouds float in the blue&#10;sky. Do you not smell the sweet perfume from flower and bush?&#10;Wherefore do you weep, old willow-tree?&#34; Then the willow told them&#10;of the haughty pride of the buckwheat, and of the punishment which&#10;followed in consequence.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;This is the story told me by the sparrows one evening when&#10;I begged them to relate some tale to me.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode(''), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;THERE was once a butterfly who wished for a bride, and, as&#10;may be supposed, he wanted to choose a very pretty one from among&#10;the flowers. He glanced, with a very critical eye, at all the&#10;flower-beds, and found that the flowers were seated quietly and&#10;demurely on their stalks, just as maidens should sit before they&#10;are engaged; but there was a great number of them, and it appeared&#10;as if his search would become very wearisome. The butterfly did not&#10;like to take too much trouble, so he flew off on a visit to the&#10;daisies. The French call this flower &#34;Marguerite,&#34; and they say&#10;that the little daisy can prophesy. Lovers pluck off the leaves,&#10;and as they pluck each leaf, they ask a question about their&#10;lovers; thus: &#34;Does he or she love me?&#8212;Ardently? Distractedly? Very&#10;much? A little? Not at all?&#34; and so on. Every one speaks these&#10;words in his own language. The butterfly came also to Marguerite to&#10;inquire, but he did not pluck off her leaves; he pressed a kiss on&#10;each of them, for he thought there was always more to be done by&#10;kindness.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Darling Marguerite daisy,&#34; he said to her, &#34;you are the&#10;wisest woman of all the flowers. Pray tell me which of the flowers&#10;I shall choose for my wife. Which will be my bride? When I know, I&#10;will fly directly to her, and propose.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But Marguerite did not answer him; she was offended that&#10;he should call her a woman when she was only a girl; and there is a&#10;great difference. He asked her a second time, and then a third; but&#10;she remained dumb, and answered not a word. Then he would wait no&#10;longer, but flew away, to commence his wooing at once. It was in&#10;the early spring, when the crocus and the snowdrop were in full&#10;bloom.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;They are very pretty,&#34; thought the butterfly; &#34;charming&#10;little lasses; but they are rather formal.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then, as the young lads often do, he looked out for the&#10;elder girls. He next flew to the anemones; these were rather sour&#10;to his taste. The violet, a little too sentimental. The&#10;lime-blossoms, too small, and besides, there was such a large&#10;family of them. The apple-blossoms, though they looked like roses,&#10;bloomed to-day, but might fall off to-morrow, with the first wind&#10;that blew; and he thought that a marriage with one of them might&#10;last too short a time. The pea-blossom pleased him most of all; she&#10;was white and red, graceful and slender, and belonged to those&#10;domestic maidens who have a pretty appearance, and can yet be&#10;useful in the kitchen. He was just about to make her an offer,&#10;when, close by the maiden, he saw a pod, with a withered flower&#10;hanging at the end.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Who is that?&#34; he asked.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That is my sister,&#34; replied the pea-blossom.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, indeed; and you will be like her some day,&#34; said he;&#10;and he flew away directly, for he felt quite shocked.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A honeysuckle hung forth from the hedge, in full bloom;&#10;but there were so many girls like her, with long faces and sallow&#10;complexions. No; he did not like her. But which one did he&#10;like?&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Spring went by, and summer drew towards its close; autumn&#10;came; but he had not decided. The flowers now appeared in their&#10;most gorgeous robes, but all in vain; they had not the fresh,&#10;fragrant air of youth. For the heart asks for fragrance, even when&#10;it is no longer young; and there is very little of that to be found&#10;in the dahlias or the dry chrysanthemums; therefore the butterfly&#10;turned to the mint on the ground. You know, this plant has no&#10;blossom; but it is sweetness all over,&#8212;full of fragrance from head&#10;to foot, with the scent of a flower in every leaf.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I will take her,&#34; said the butterfly; and he made her an&#10;offer. But the mint stood silent and stiff, as she listened to him.&#10;At last she said,&#8212;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Friendship, if you please; nothing more. I am old, and&#10;you are old, but we may live for each other just the same; as to&#10;marrying&#8212;no; don&#39;t let us appear ridiculous at our age.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And so it happened that the butterfly got no wife at all.&#10;He had been too long choosing, which is always a bad plan. And the&#10;butterfly became what is called an old bachelor.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was late in the autumn, with rainy and cloudy weather.&#10;The cold wind blew over the bowed backs of the willows, so that&#10;they creaked again. It was not the weather for flying about in&#10;summer clothes; but fortunately the butterfly was not out in it. He&#10;had got a shelter by chance. It was in a room heated by a stove,&#10;and as warm as summer. He could exist here, he said, well&#10;enough.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But it is not enough merely to exist,&#34; said he, &#34;I need&#10;freedom, sunshine, and a little flower for a companion.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then he flew against the window-pane, and was seen and&#10;admired by those in the room, who caught him, and stuck him on a&#10;pin, in a box of curiosities. They could not do more for&#10;him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Now I am perched on a stalk, like the flowers,&#34; said the&#10;butterfly. &#34;It is not very pleasant, certainly; I should imagine it&#10;is something like being married; for here I am stuck fast.&#34; And&#10;with this thought he consoled himself a little.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That seems very poor consolation,&#34; said one of the plants&#10;in the room, that grew in a pot.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ah,&#34; thought the butterfly, &#34;one can&#39;t very well trust&#10;these plants in pots; they have too much to do with mankind.&#34;&#10;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode(''), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;FROM my father I received the best inheritance, namely a&#10;&#34;good temper.&#34; &#34;And who was my father?&#34; That has nothing to do with&#10;the good temper; but I will say he was lively, good-looking round,&#10;and fat; he was both in appearance and character a complete&#10;contradiction to his profession. &#34;And pray what was his profession&#10;and his standing in respectable society?&#34; Well, perhaps, if in the&#10;beginning of a book these were written and printed, many, when they&#10;read it, would lay the book down and say, &#34;It seems to me a very&#10;miserable title, I don&#39;t like things of this sort.&#34; And yet my&#10;father was not a skin-dresser nor an executioner; on the contrary,&#10;his employment placed him at the head of the grandest people of the&#10;town, and it was his place by right. He had to precede the bishop,&#10;and even the princes of the blood; he always went first,&#8212;he was a&#10;hearse driver! There, now, the truth is out. And I will own, that&#10;when people saw my father perched up in front of the omnibus of&#10;death, dressed in his long, wide, black cloak, and his black-edged,&#10;three-cornered hat on his head, and then glanced at his round,&#10;jocund face, round as the sun, they could not think much of sorrow&#10;or the grave. That face said, &#34;It is nothing, it will all end&#10;better than people think.&#34; So I have inherited from him, not only&#10;my good temper, but a habit of going often to the churchyard, which&#10;is good, when done in a proper humor; and then also I take in the&#10;Intelligencer, just as he used to do.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;I am not very young, I have neither wife nor children, nor&#10;a library, but, as I said, I read the Intelligencer, which is&#10;enough for me; it is to me a delightful paper, and so it was to my&#10;father. It is of great use, for it contains all that a man requires&#10;to know; the names of the preachers at the church, and the new&#10;books which are published; where houses, servants, clothes, and&#10;provisions may be obtained. And then what a number of subscriptions&#10;to charities, and what innocent verses! Persons seeking interviews&#10;and engagements, all so plainly and naturally stated. Certainly, a&#10;man who takes in the Intelligencer may live merrily and be buried&#10;contentedly, and by the end of his life will have such a capital&#10;stock of paper that he can lie on a soft bed of it, unless he&#10;prefers wood shavings for his resting-place. The newspaper and the&#10;churchyard were always exciting objects to me. My walks to the&#10;latter were like bathing-places to my good humor. Every one can&#10;read the newspaper for himself, but come with me to the churchyard&#10;while the sun shines and the trees are green, and let us wander&#10;among the graves. Each of them is like a closed book, with the back&#10;uppermost, on which we can read the title of what the book&#10;contains, but nothing more. I had a great deal of information from&#10;my father, and I have noticed a great deal myself. I keep it in my&#10;diary, in which I write for my own use and pleasure a history of&#10;all who lie here, and a few more beside.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Now we are in the churchyard. Here, behind the white iron&#10;railings, once a rose-tree grew; it is gone now, but a little bit&#10;of evergreen, from a neighboring grave, stretches out its green&#10;tendrils, and makes some appearance; there rests a very unhappy&#10;man, and yet while he lived he might be said to occupy a very good&#10;position. He had enough to live upon, and something to spare; but&#10;owing to his refined tastes the least thing in the world annoyed&#10;him. If he went to a theatre of an evening, instead of enjoying&#10;himself he would be quite annoyed if the machinist had put too&#10;strong a light into one side of the moon, or if the representations&#10;of the sky hung over the scenes when they ought to have hung behind&#10;them; or if a palm-tree was introduced into a scene representing&#10;the Zoological Gardens of Berlin, or a cactus in a view of Tyrol,&#10;or a beech-tree in the north of Norway. As if these things were of&#10;any consequence! Why did he not leave them alone? Who would trouble&#10;themselves about such trifles? especially at a comedy, where every&#10;one is expected to be amused. Then sometimes the public applauded&#10;too much, or too little, to please him. &#34;They are like wet wood,&#34;&#10;he would say, looking round to see what sort of people were&#10;present, &#34;this evening; nothing fires them.&#34; Then he would vex and&#10;fret himself because they did not laugh at the right time, or&#10;because they laughed in the wrong places; and so he fretted and&#10;worried himself till at last the unhappy man fretted himself into&#10;the grave.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Here rests a happy man, that is to say, a man of high&#10;birth and position, which was very lucky for him, otherwise he&#10;would have been scarcely worth notice. It is beautiful to observe&#10;how wisely nature orders these things. He walked about in a coat&#10;embroidered all over, and in the drawing-rooms of society looked&#10;just like one of those rich pearl-embroidered bell-pulls, which are&#10;only made for show; and behind them always hangs a good thick cord&#10;for use. This man also had a stout, useful substitute behind him,&#10;who did duty for him, and performed all his dirty work. And there&#10;are still, even now, these serviceable cords behind other&#10;embroidered bell-ropes. It is all so wisely arranged, that a man&#10;may well be in a good humor.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Here rests,&#8212;ah, it makes one feel mournful to think of&#10;him!&#8212;but here rests a man who, during sixty-seven years, was never&#10;remembered to have said a good thing; he lived only in the hope of&#10;having a good idea. At last he felt convinced, in his own mind,&#10;that he really had one, and was so delighted that he positively&#10;died of joy at the thought of having at last caught an idea. Nobody&#10;got anything by it; indeed, no one even heard what the good thing&#10;was. Now I can imagine that this same idea may prevent him from&#10;resting quietly in his grave; for suppose that to produce a good&#10;effect, it is necessary to bring out his new idea at breakfast, and&#10;that he can only make his appearance on earth at midnight, as&#10;ghosts are believed generally to do; why then this good idea would&#10;not suit the hour, and the man would have to carry it down again&#10;with him into the grave&#8212;that must be a troubled grave.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The woman who lies here was so remarkably stingy, that&#10;during her life she would get up in the night and mew, that her&#10;neighbors might think she kept a cat. What a miser she&#10;was!&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Here rests a young lady, of a good family, who would&#10;always make her voice heard in society, and when she sang &#34;Mi manca&#10;la voce,&#34;&#60;a href=&#34;footnotes.xml#footnote_1&#34; class=&#34;footnote&#34; id=&#34;footnote_1_call&#34;&#62;[1]&#60;/a&#62; &#38;#160;it was the only true thing she ever&#10;said in her life.&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Here lies a maiden of another description. She was engaged&#10;to be married,&#8212;but, her story is one of every-day life; we will&#10;leave her to rest in the grave.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Here rests a widow, who, with music in her tongue, carried&#10;gall in her heart. She used to go round among the families near,&#10;and search out their faults, upon which she preyed with all the&#10;envy and malice of her nature. This is a family grave. The members&#10;of this family held so firmly together in their opinions, that they&#10;would believe in no other. If the newspapers, or even the whole&#10;world, said of a certain subject, &#34;It is so-and-so;&#34; and a little&#10;schoolboy declared he had learned quite differently, they would&#10;take his assertion as the only true one, because he belonged to the&#10;family. And it is well known that if the yard-cock belonging to&#10;this family happened to crow at midnight, they would declare it was&#10;morning, although the watchman and all the clocks in the town were&#10;proclaiming the hour of twelve at night.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The great poet Goethe concludes his Faust with the words,&#10;&#34;may be continued;&#34; so might our wanderings in the churchyard be&#10;continued. I come here often, and if any of my friends, or those&#10;who are not my friends, are too much for me, I go out and choose a&#10;plot of ground in which to bury him or her. Then I bury them, as it&#10;were; there they lie, dead and powerless, till they come back new&#10;and better characters. Their lives and their deeds, looked at after&#10;my own fashion, I write down in my diary, as every one ought to do.&#10;Then, if any of our friends act absurdly, no one need to be vexed&#10;about it. Let them bury the offenders out of sight, and keep their&#10;good temper. They can also read the Intelligencer, which is a paper&#10;written by the people, with their hands guided. When the time comes&#10;for the history of my life, to be bound by the grave, then they&#10;will write upon it as my epitaph&#8212;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The man with a cheerful temper.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And this is my story. &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode(''), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;IT was a very sad day, and every heart in the house felt&#10;the deepest grief; for the youngest child, a boy of four years old,&#10;the joy and hope of his parents, was dead. Two daughters, the elder&#10;of whom was going to be confirmed, still remained: they were both&#10;good, charming girls; but the lost child always seems the dearest;&#10;and when it is youngest, and a son, it makes the trial still more&#10;heavy. The sisters mourned as young hearts can mourn, and were&#10;especially grieved at the sight of their parents&#39; sorrow. The&#10;father&#39;s heart was bowed down, but the mother sunk completely under&#10;the deep grief. Day and night she had attended to the sick child,&#10;nursing and carrying it in her bosom, as a part of herself. She&#10;could not realize the fact that the child was dead, and must be&#10;laid in a coffin to rest in the ground. She thought God could not&#10;take her darling little one from her; and when it did happen&#10;notwithstanding her hopes and her belief, and there could be no&#10;more doubt on the subject, she said in her feverish agony, &#34;God&#10;does not know it. He has hard-hearted ministering spirits on earth,&#10;who do according to their own will, and heed not a mother&#39;s&#10;prayers.&#34; Thus in her great grief she fell away from her faith in&#10;God, and dark thoughts arose in her mind respecting death and a&#10;future state. She tried to believe that man was but dust, and that&#10;with his life all existence ended. But these doubts were no support&#10;to her, nothing on which she could rest, and she sunk into the&#10;fathomless depths of despair. In her darkest hours she ceased to&#10;weep, and thought not of the young daughters who were still left to&#10;her. The tears of her husband fell on her forehead, but she took no&#10;notice of him; her thoughts were with her dead child; her whole&#10;existence seemed wrapped up in the remembrances of the little one&#10;and of every innocent word it had uttered.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The day of the little child&#39;s funeral came. For nights&#10;previously the mother had not slept, but in the morning twilight of&#10;this day she sunk from weariness into a deep sleep; in the mean&#10;time the coffin was carried into a distant room, and there nailed&#10;down, that she might not hear the blows of the hammer. When she&#10;awoke, and wanted to see her child, the husband, with tears, said,&#10;&#34;We have closed the coffin; it was necessary to do so.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;When God is so hard to me, how can I expect men to be&#10;better?&#34; she said with groans and tears.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The coffin was carried to the grave, and the disconsolate&#10;mother sat with her young daughters. She looked at them, but she&#10;saw them not; for her thoughts were far away from the domestic&#10;hearth. She gave herself up to her grief, and it tossed her to and&#10;fro, as the sea tosses a ship without compass or rudder. So the day&#10;of the funeral passed away, and similar days followed, of dark,&#10;wearisome pain. With tearful eyes and mournful glances, the&#10;sorrowing daughters and the afflicted husband looked upon her who&#10;would not hear their words of comfort; and, indeed, what comforting&#10;words could they speak, when they were themselves so full of grief?&#10;It seemed as if she would never again know sleep, and yet it would&#10;have been her best friend, one who would have strengthened her body&#10;and poured peace into her soul. They at last persuaded her to lie&#10;down, and then she would lie as still as if she slept.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;One night, when her husband listened, as he often did, to&#10;her breathing, he quite believed that she had at length found rest&#10;and relief in sleep. He folded his arms and prayed, and soon sunk&#10;himself into healthful sleep; therefore he did not notice that his&#10;wife arose, threw on her clothes, and glided silently from the&#10;house, to go where her thoughts constantly lingered&#8212;to the grave of&#10;her child. She passed through the garden, to a path across a field&#10;that led to the churchyard. No one saw her as she walked, nor did&#10;she see any one; for her eyes were fixed upon the one object of her&#10;wanderings. It was a lovely starlight night in the beginning of&#10;September, and the air was mild and still. She entered the&#10;churchyard, and stood by the little grave, which looked like a&#10;large nosegay of fragrant flowers. She sat down, and bent her head&#10;low over the grave, as if she could see her child through the earth&#10;that covered him&#8212;her little boy, whose smile was so vividly before&#10;her, and the gentle expression of whose eyes, even on his sick-bed,&#10;she could not forget. How full of meaning that glance had been, as&#10;she leaned over him, holding in hers the pale hand which he had no&#10;longer strength to raise! As she had sat by his little cot, so now&#10;she sat by his grave; and here she could weep freely, and her tears&#10;fell upon it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Thou wouldst gladly go down and be with thy child,&#34; said&#10;a voice quite close to her,&#8212;a voice that sounded so deep and clear,&#10;that it went to her heart.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;She looked up, and by her side stood a man wrapped in a&#10;black cloak, with a hood closely drawn over his face; but her keen&#10;glance could distinguish the face under the hood. It was stern, yet&#10;awakened confidence, and the eyes beamed with youthful&#10;radiance.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Down to my child,&#34; she repeated; and tones of despair and&#10;entreaty sounded in the words.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Darest thou to follow me?&#34; asked the form. &#34;I am&#10;Death.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;She bowed her head in token of assent. Then suddenly it&#10;appeared as if all the stars were shining with the radiance of the&#10;full moon on the many-colored flowers that decked the grave. The&#10;earth that covered it was drawn back like a floating drapery. She&#10;sunk down, and the spectre covered her with a black cloak; night&#10;closed around her, the night of death. She sank deeper than the&#10;spade of the sexton could penetrate, till the churchyard became a&#10;roof above her. Then the cloak was removed, and she found herself&#10;in a large hall, of wide-spreading dimensions, in which there was a&#10;subdued light, like twilight, reigning, and in a moment her child&#10;appeared before her, smiling, and more beautiful than ever; with a&#10;silent cry she pressed him to her heart. A glorious strain of music&#10;sounded&#8212;now distant, now near. Never had she listened to such tones&#10;as these; they came from beyond a large dark curtain which&#10;separated the regions of death from the land of&#10;eternity.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;My sweet, darling mother,&#34; she heard the child say. It&#10;was the well-known, beloved voice; and kiss followed kiss, in&#10;boundless delight. Then the child pointed to the dark curtain.&#10;&#34;There is nothing so beautiful on earth as it is here. Mother, do&#10;you not see them all? Oh, it is happiness indeed.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But the mother saw nothing of what the child pointed out,&#10;only the dark curtain. She looked with earthly eyes, and could not&#10;see as the child saw,&#8212;he whom God has called to be with Himself.&#10;She could hear the sounds of music, but she heard not the words,&#10;the Word in which she was to trust.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I can fly now, mother,&#34; said the child; &#34;I can fly with&#10;other happy children into the presence of the Almighty. I would&#10;fain fly away now; but if you weep for me as you are weeping now,&#10;you may never see me again. And yet I would go so gladly. May I not&#10;fly away? And you will come to me soon, will you not, dear&#10;mother?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, stay, stay!&#34; implored the mother; &#34;only one moment&#10;more; only once more, that I may look upon thee, and kiss thee, and&#10;press thee to my heart.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then she kissed and fondled her child. Suddenly her name&#10;was called from above; what could it mean? her name uttered in a&#10;plaintive voice.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Hearest thou?&#34; said the child. &#34;It is my father who calls&#10;thee.&#34; And in a few moments deep sighs were heard, as of children&#10;weeping. &#34;They are my sisters,&#34; said the child. &#34;Mother, surely you&#10;have not forgotten them.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And then she remembered those she left behind, and a great&#10;terror came over her. She looked around her at the dark night. Dim&#10;forms flitted by. She seemed to recognize some of them, as they&#10;floated through the regions of death towards the dark curtain,&#10;where they vanished. Would her husband and her daughters flit past?&#10;No; their sighs and lamentations still sounded from above; and she&#10;had nearly forgotten them, for the sake of him who was&#10;dead.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Mother, now the bells of heaven are ringing,&#34; said the&#10;child; &#34;mother, the sun is going to rise.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;An overpowering light streamed in upon her, the child had&#10;vanished, and she was being borne upwards. All around her became&#10;cold; she lifted her head, and saw that she was lying in the&#10;churchyard, on the grave of her child. The Lord, in a dream, had&#10;been a guide to her feet and a light to her spirit. She bowed her&#10;knees, and prayed for forgiveness. She had wished to keep back a&#10;soul from its immortal flight; she had forgotten her duties towards&#10;the living who were left her. And when she had offered this prayer,&#10;her heart felt lighter. The sun burst forth, over her head a little&#10;bird carolled his song, and the church-bells sounded for the early&#10;service. Everything around her seemed holy, and her heart was&#10;chastened. She acknowledged the goodness of God, she acknowledged&#10;the duties she had to perform, and eagerly she returned home. She&#10;bent over her husband, who still slept; her warm, devoted kiss&#10;awakened him, and words of heartfelt love fell from the lips of&#10;both. Now she was gentle and strong as a wife can be; and from her&#10;lips came the words of faith: &#34;Whatever He doeth is right and&#10;best.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then her husband asked, &#34;From whence hast thou all at once&#10;derived such strength and comforting faith?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And as she kissed him and her children, she said, &#34;It came&#10;from God, through my child in the grave.&#34; &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')

They were both arrogant, but which of the two rendered&#10;most service? Tell us your opinion&#8212;we&#39;ll keep to ours just the same&#10;though.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The poultry yard was divided by some planks from another&#10;yard in which there was a dung-hill, and on the dung-hill lay and&#10;grew a large cucumber which was conscious of being a hot-bed&#10;plant.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;One is born to that,&#34; said the cucumber to itself. &#34;Not&#10;all can be born cucumbers; there must be other things, too. The&#10;hens, the ducks, and all the animals in the next yard are creatures&#10;too. Now I have a great opinion of the yard cock on the plank; he&#10;is certainly of much more importance than the weather-cock who is&#10;placed so high and can&#39;t even creak, much less crow. The latter has&#10;neither hens nor chicks, and only thinks of himself and perspires&#10;verdigris. No, the yard cock is really a cock! His step is a dance!&#10;His crowing is music, and wherever he goes one knows what a&#10;trumpeter is like! If he would only come in here! Even if he ate me&#10;up stump, stalk, and all, and I had to dissolve in his body, it&#10;would be a happy death,&#34; said the cucumber.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the night there was a terrible storm. The hens, chicks,&#10;and even the cock sought shelter; the wind tore down the planks&#10;between the two yards with a crash; the tiles came tumbling down,&#10;but the weather-cock sat firm. He did not even turn round, for he&#10;could not; and yet he was young and freshly cast, but prudent and&#10;sedate. He had been born old, and did not at all resemble the birds&#10;flying in the air&#8212;the sparrows, and the swallows; no, he despised&#10;them, these mean little piping birds, these common whistlers. He&#10;admitted that the pigeons, large and white and shining like&#10;mother-o&#39;-pearl, looked like a kind of weather-cock; but they were&#10;fat and stupid, and all their thoughts and endeavours were directed&#10;to filling themselves with food, and besides, they were tiresome&#10;things to converse with. The birds of passage had also paid the&#10;weather-cock a visit and told him of foreign countries, of airy&#10;caravans and robber stories that made one&#39;s hair stand on end. All&#10;this was new and interesting; that is, for the first time, but&#10;afterwards, as the weather-cock found out, they repeated themselves&#10;and always told the same stories, and that&#39;s very tedious, and&#10;there was no one with whom one could associate, for one and all&#10;were stale and small-minded.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The world is no good!&#34; he said. &#34;Everything in it is so&#10;stupid.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The weather-cock was puffed up, and that quality would&#10;have made him interesting in the eyes of the cucumber if it had&#10;known it, but it had eyes only for the yard cock, who was now in&#10;the yard with it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The wind had blown the planks, but the storm was&#10;over.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What do you think of that crowing?&#34; said the yard cock to&#10;the hens and chickens. &#34;It was a little rough&#8212;it wanted&#10;elegance.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the hens and chickens came up on the dung-hill, and&#10;the cock strutted about like a lord.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Garden plant!&#34; he said to the cucumber, and in that one&#10;word his deep learning showed itself, and it forgot that he was&#10;pecking at her and eating it up. &#34;A happy death!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The hens and the chickens came, for where one runs the&#10;others run too; they clucked, and chirped, and looked at the cock,&#10;and were proud that he was of their kind.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Cock-a-doodle-doo!&#34; he crowed, &#34;the chickens will grow up&#10;into great hens at once, if I cry it out in the poultry-yard of the&#10;world!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And hens and chicks clucked and chirped, and the cock&#10;announced a great piece of news.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;A cock can lay an egg! And do you know what&#39;s in that&#10;egg? A basilisk. No one can stand the sight of such a thing; people&#10;know that, and now you know it too&#8212;you know what is in me, and what&#10;a champion of all cocks I am!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;With that the yard cock flapped his wings, made his comb&#10;swell up, and crowed again; and they all shuddered, the hens and&#10;the little chicks&#8212;but they were very proud that one of their number&#10;was such a champion of all cocks. They clucked and chirped till the&#10;weather-cock heard; he heard it; but he did not stir.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Everything is very stupid,&#34; the weather-cock said to&#10;himself. &#34;The yard cock lays no eggs, and I am too lazy to do so;&#10;if I liked, I could lay a wind-egg. But the world is not worth even&#10;a wind-egg. Everything is so stupid!

Text.create(:title => coder.decode(''), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Now listen! In the country, close by the high road, stood&#10;a farmhouse; perhaps you have passed by and seen it yourself. There&#10;was a little flower garden with painted wooden palings in front of&#10;it; close by was a ditch, on its fresh green bank grew a little&#10;daisy; the sun shone as warmly and brightly upon it as on the&#10;magnificent garden flowers, and therefore it thrived well. One&#10;morning it had quite opened, and its little snow-white petals stood&#10;round the yellow centre, like the rays of the sun. It did not mind&#10;that nobody saw it in the grass, and that it was a poor despised&#10;flower; on the contrary, it was quite happy, and turned towards the&#10;sun, looking upward and listening to the song of the lark high up&#10;in the air.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The little daisy was as happy as if the day had been a&#10;great holiday, but it was only Monday. All the children were at&#10;school, and while they were sitting on the forms and learning their&#10;lessons, it sat on its thin green stalk and learnt from the sun and&#10;from its surroundings how kind God is, and it rejoiced that the&#10;song of the little lark expressed so sweetly and distinctly its own&#10;feelings. With a sort of reverence the daisy looked up to the bird&#10;that could fly and sing, but it did not feel envious. &#34;I can see&#10;and hear,&#34; it thought; &#34;the sun shines upon me, and the forest&#10;kisses me. How rich I am!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the garden close by grew many large and magnificent&#10;flowers, and, strange to say, the less fragrance they had the&#10;haughtier and prouder they were. The peonies puffed themselves up&#10;in order to be larger than the roses, but size is not everything!&#10;The tulips had the finest colours, and they knew it well, too, for&#10;they were standing bolt upright like candles, that one might see&#10;them the better. In their pride they did not see the little daisy,&#10;which looked over to them and thought, &#34;How rich and beautiful they&#10;are! I am sure the pretty bird will fly down and call upon them.&#10;Thank God, that I stand so near and can at least see all the&#10;splendour.&#34; And while the daisy was still thinking, the lark came&#10;flying down, crying &#34;Tweet,&#34; but not to the peonies and tulips&#8212;no,&#10;into the grass to the poor daisy. Its joy was so great that it did&#10;not know what to think. The little bird hopped round it and sang,&#10;&#34;How beautifully soft the grass is, and what a lovely little flower&#10;with its golden heart and silver dress is growing here.&#34; The yellow&#10;centre in the daisy did indeed look like gold, while the little&#10;petals shone as brightly as silver.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;How happy the daisy was! No one has the least idea. The&#10;bird kissed it with its beak, sang to it, and then rose again up to&#10;the blue sky. It was certainly more than a quarter of an hour&#10;before the daisy recovered its senses. Half ashamed, yet glad at&#10;heart, it looked over to the other flowers in the garden; surely&#10;they had witnessed its pleasure and the honour that had been done&#10;to it; they understood its joy. But the tulips stood more stiffly&#10;than ever, their faces were pointed and red, because they were&#10;vexed. The peonies were sulky; it was well that they could not&#10;speak, otherwise they would have given the daisy a good lecture.&#10;The little flower could very well see that they were ill at ease,&#10;and pitied them sincerely.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Shortly after this a girl came into the garden, with a&#10;large sharp knife. She went to the tulips and began cutting them&#10;off, one after another. &#34;Ugh!&#34; sighed the daisy, &#34;that is terrible;&#10;now they are done for.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The girl carried the tulips away. The daisy was glad that&#10;it was outside, and only a small flower&#8212;it felt very grateful. At&#10;sunset it folded its petals, and fell asleep, and dreamt all night&#10;of the sun and the little bird.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;On the following morning, when the flower once more&#10;stretched forth its tender petals, like little arms, towards the&#10;air and light, the daisy recognised the bird&#39;s voice, but what it&#10;sang sounded so sad. Indeed the poor bird had good reason to be&#10;sad, for it had been caught and put into a cage close by the open&#10;window. It sang of the happy days when it could merrily fly about,&#10;of fresh green corn in the fields, and of the time when it could&#10;soar almost up to the clouds. The poor lark was most unhappy as a&#10;prisoner in a cage. The little daisy would have liked so much to&#10;help it, but what could be done? Indeed, that was very difficult&#10;for such a small flower to find out. It entirely forgot how&#10;beautiful everything around it was, how warmly the sun was shining,&#10;and how splendidly white its own petals were. It could only think&#10;of the poor captive bird, for which it could do nothing. Then two&#10;little boys came out of the garden; one of them had a large sharp&#10;knife, like that with which the girl had cut the tulips. They came&#10;straight towards the little daisy, which could not understand what&#10;they wanted.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Here is a fine piece of turf for the lark,&#34; said one of&#10;the boys, and began to cut out a square round the daisy, so that it&#10;remained in the centre of the grass.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Pluck the flower off&#34; said the other boy, and the daisy&#10;trembled for fear, for to be pulled off meant death to it; and it&#10;wished so much to live, as it was to go with the square of turf&#10;into the poor captive lark&#39;s cage.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No let it stay,&#34; said the other boy, &#34;it looks so&#10;pretty&#34;.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And so it stayed, and was brought into the lark&#39;s cage.&#10;The poor bird was lamenting its lost liberty, and beating its wings&#10;against the wires; and the little daisy could not speak or utter a&#10;consoling word, much as it would have liked to do so. So the&#10;forenoon passed.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I have no water,&#34; said the captive lark, &#34;they have all&#10;gone out, and forgotten to give me anything to drink. My throat is&#10;dry and burning. I feel as if I had fire and ice within me, and the&#10;air is so oppressive. Alas! I must die, and part with the warm&#10;sunshine, the fresh green meadows, and all the beauty that God has&#10;created.&#34; And it thrust its beak into the piece of grass, to&#10;refresh itself a little. Then it noticed the little daisy, and&#10;nodded to it, and kissed it with its beak and said: &#34;You must also&#10;fade in here, poor little flower. You and the piece of grass are&#10;all they have given me in exchange for the whole world, which I&#10;enjoyed outside. Each little blade of grass shall be a green tree&#10;for me, each of your white petals a fragrant flower. Alas! you only&#10;remind me of what I have lost.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I wish I could console the poor lark,&#34; thought the daisy.&#10;It could not move one of its leaves, but the fragrance of its&#10;delicate petals streamed forth, and was much stronger than such&#10;flowers usually have: the bird noticed it, although it was dying&#10;with thirst, and in its pain tore up the green blades of grass, but&#10;did not touch the flower.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The evening came, and nobody appeared to bring the poor&#10;bird a drop of water; it opened its beautiful wings, and fluttered&#10;about in its anguish; a faint and mournful &#34;Tweet, tweet,&#34; was all&#10;it could utter, then it bent its little head towards the flower,&#10;and its heart broke for want and longing. The flower could not, as&#10;on the previous evening, fold up its petals and sleep; it dropped&#10;sorrowfully. The boys only came the next morning; when they saw the&#10;dead bird, they began to cry bitterly, dug a nice grave for it, and&#10;adorned it with flowers. The bird&#39;s body was placed in a pretty red&#10;box; they wished to bury it with royal honours. While it was alive&#10;and sang they forgot it, and let it suffer want in the cage; now,&#10;they cried over it and covered it with flowers. The piece of turf,&#10;with the little daisy in it, was thrown out on the dusty highway.&#10;Nobody thought of the flower which had felt so much for the bird&#10;and had so greatly desired to comfort it. &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode(''), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;THERE was once a darning-needle who thought herself so&#10;fine that she fancied she must be fit for embroidery. &#34;Hold me&#10;tight,&#34; she would say to the fingers, when they took her up, &#34;don&#39;t&#10;let me fall; if you do I shall never be found again, I am so very&#10;fine.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That is your opinion, is it?&#34; said the fingers, as they&#10;seized her round the body.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;See, I am coming with a train,&#34; said the darning-needle,&#10;drawing a long thread after her; but there was no knot in the&#10;thread.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The fingers then placed the point of the needle against&#10;the cook&#39;s slipper. There was a crack in the upper leather, which&#10;had to be sewn together.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What coarse work!&#34; said the darning-needle, &#34;I shall&#10;never get through. I shall break!&#8212;I am breaking!&#34; and sure enough&#10;she broke. &#34;Did I not say so?&#34; said the darning-needle, &#34;I know I&#10;am too fine for such work as that.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;This needle is quite useless for sewing now,&#34; said the&#10;fingers; but they still held it fast, and the cook dropped some&#10;sealing-wax on the needle, and fastened her handkerchief with it in&#10;front.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;So now I am a breast-pin,&#34; said the darning-needle; &#34;I&#10;knew very well I should come to honor some day: merit is sure to&#10;rise;&#34; and she laughed, quietly to herself, for of course no one&#10;ever saw a darning-needle laugh. And there she sat as proudly as if&#10;she were in a state coach, and looked all around her. &#34;May I be&#10;allowed to ask if you are made of gold?&#34; she inquired of her&#10;neighbor, a pin; &#34;you have a very pretty appearance, and a curious&#10;head, although you are rather small. You must take pains to grow,&#10;for it is not every one who has sealing-wax dropped upon him;&#34; and&#10;as she spoke, the darning-needle drew herself up so proudly that&#10;she fell out of the handkerchief right into the sink, which the&#10;cook was cleaning. &#34;Now I am going on a journey,&#34; said the needle,&#10;as she floated away with the dirty water, &#34;I do hope I shall not be&#10;lost.&#34; But she really was lost in a gutter. &#34;I am too fine for this&#10;world,&#34; said the darning-needle, as she lay in the gutter; &#34;but I&#10;know who I am, and that is always some comfort.&#34; So the&#10;darning-needle kept up her proud behavior, and did not lose her&#10;good humor. Then there floated over her all sorts of things,&#8212;chips&#10;and straws, and pieces of old newspaper. &#34;See how they sail,&#34; said&#10;the darning-needle; &#34;they do not know what is under them. I am&#10;here, and here I shall stick. See, there goes a chip, thinking of&#10;nothing in the world but himself&#8212;only a chip. There&#39;s a straw going&#10;by now; how he turns and twists about! Don&#39;t be thinking too much&#10;of yourself, or you may chance to run against a stone. There swims&#10;a piece of newspaper; what is written upon it has been forgotten&#10;long ago, and yet it gives itself airs. I sit here patiently and&#10;quietly. I know who I am, so I shall not move.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;One day something lying close to the darning-needle&#10;glittered so splendidly that she thought it was a diamond; yet it&#10;was only a piece of broken bottle. The darning-needle spoke to it,&#10;because it sparkled, and represented herself as a breast-pin. &#34;I&#10;suppose you are really a diamond?&#34; she said.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Why yes, something of the kind,&#34; he replied; and so each&#10;believed the other to be very valuable, and then they began to talk&#10;about the world, and the conceited people in it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I have been in a lady&#39;s work-box,&#34; said the&#10;darning-needle, &#34;and this lady was the cook. She had on each hand&#10;five fingers, and anything so conceited as these five fingers I&#10;have never seen; and yet they were only employed to take me out of&#10;the box and to put me back again.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Were they not high-born?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;High-born!&#34; said the darning-needle, &#34;no indeed, but so&#10;haughty. They were five brothers, all born fingers; they kept very&#10;proudly together, though they were of different lengths. The one&#10;who stood first in the rank was named the thumb, he was short and&#10;thick, and had only one joint in his back, and could therefore make&#10;but one bow; but he said that if he were cut off from a man&#39;s hand,&#10;that man would be unfit for a soldier. Sweet-tooth, his neighbor,&#10;dipped himself into sweet or sour, pointed to the sun and moon, and&#10;formed the letters when the fingers wrote. Longman, the middle&#10;finger, looked over the heads of all the others. Gold-band, the&#10;next finger, wore a golden circle round his waist. And little&#10;Playman did nothing at all, and seemed proud of it. They were&#10;boasters, and boasters they will remain; and therefore I left&#10;them.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And now we sit here and glitter,&#34; said the piece of&#10;broken bottle.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;At the same moment more water streamed into the gutter, so&#10;that it overflowed, and the piece of bottle was carried&#10;away.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;So he is promoted,&#34; said the darning-needle, &#34;while I&#10;remain here; I am too fine, but that is my pride, and what do I&#10;care?&#34; And so she sat there in her pride, and had many such&#10;thoughts as these,&#8212;&#34;I could almost fancy that I came from a&#10;sunbeam, I am so fine. It seems as if the sunbeams were always&#10;looking for me under the water. Ah! I am so fine that even my&#10;mother cannot find me. Had I still my old eye, which was broken&#10;off, I believe I should weep; but no, I would not do that, it is&#10;not genteel to cry.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;One day a couple of street boys were paddling in the&#10;gutter, for they sometimes found old nails, farthings, and other&#10;treasures. It was dirty work, but they took great pleasure in it.&#10;&#34;Hallo!&#34; cried one, as he pricked himself with the darning-needle,&#10;&#34;here&#39;s a fellow for you.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I am not a fellow, I am a young lady,&#34; said the&#10;darning-needle; but no one heard her.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The sealing-wax had come off, and she was quite black; but&#10;black makes a person look slender, so she thought herself even&#10;finer than before.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Here comes an egg-shell sailing along,&#34; said one of the&#10;boys; so they stuck the darning-needle into the&#10;egg-shell.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;White walls, and I am black myself,&#34; said the&#10;darning-needle, &#34;that looks well; now I can be seen, but I hope I&#10;shall not be sea-sick, or I shall break again.&#34; She was not&#10;sea-sick, and she did not break. &#34;It is a good thing against&#10;sea-sickness to have a steel stomach, and not to forget one&#39;s own&#10;importance. Now my sea-sickness has past: delicate people can bear&#10;a great deal.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Crack went the egg-shell, as a waggon passed over it.&#10;&#34;Good heavens, how it crushes!&#34; said the darning-needle. &#34;I shall&#10;be sick now. I am breaking!&#34; but she did not break, though the&#10;waggon went over her as she lay at full length; and there let her&#10;lie. &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode(''), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;THERE was an old mansion surrounded by a marshy ditch with&#10;a drawbridge which was but seldom let down:&#8212;not all guests are good&#10;people. Under the roof were loopholes to shoot through, and to pour&#10;down boiling water or even molten lead on the enemy, should he&#10;approach. Inside the house the rooms were very high and had&#10;ceilings of beams, and that was very useful considering the great&#10;deal of smoke which rose up from the chimney fire where the large,&#10;damp logs of wood smouldered. On the walls hung pictures of knights&#10;in armour and proud ladies in gorgeous dresses; the most stately of&#10;all walked about alive. She was called Meta Mogen; she was the&#10;mistress of the house, to her belonged the castle.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Towards the evening robbers came; they killed three of her&#10;people and also the yard&#8212;dog, and attached Mrs. Meta to the kennel&#10;by the chain, while they themselves made good cheer in the hall and&#10;drank the wine and the good ale out of her cellar. Mrs. Meta was&#10;now on the chain, she could not even bark.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But lo! the servant of one of the robbers secretly&#10;approached her; they must not see it, otherwise they would have&#10;killed him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Mrs. Meta Mogen,&#34; said the fellow, &#34;do you still remember&#10;how my father, when your husband was still alive, had to ride on&#10;the wooden horse? You prayed for him, but it was no good, he was to&#10;ride until his limbs were paralysed; but you stole down to him, as&#10;I steal now to you, you yourself put little stones under each of&#10;his feet that he might have support, nobody saw it, or they&#10;pretended not to see it, for you were then the young gracious&#10;mistress. My father has told me this, and I have not forgotten it!&#10;Now I will free you, Mrs. Meta Mogen!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then they pulled the horses out of the stable and rode off&#10;in rain and wind to obtain the assistance of friends.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Thus the small service done to the old man was richly&#10;rewarded!&#34; said Meta Mogen.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Delaying is not forgetting,&#34; said the fellow.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The robbers were hanged.&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;There was an old mansion, it is still there; it did not&#10;belong to Mrs. Meta Mogen, it belonged to another old noble&#10;family.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;We are now in the present time. The sun is shining on the&#10;gilt knob of the tower, little wooded islands lie like bouquets on&#10;the water, and wild swans are swimming round them. In the garden&#10;grow roses; the mistress of the house is herself the finest rose&#10;petal, she beams with joy, the joy of good deeds: however, not done&#10;in the wide world, but in her heart, and what is preserved there is&#10;not forgotten. Delaying is not forgetting!&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Now she goes from the mansion to a little peasant hut in&#10;the field. Therein lives a poor paralysed girl; the window of her&#10;little room looks northward, the sun does not enter here. The girl&#10;can only see a small piece of field which is surrounded by a high&#10;fence. But to-day the sun shines here&#8212;the warm, beautiful sun of&#10;God is within the little room; it comes from the south through the&#10;new window, where formerly the wall was.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The paralysed girl sits in the warm sunshine and can see&#10;the wood and the lake; the world had become so large, so beautiful,&#10;and only through a single word from the kind mistress of the&#10;mansion.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The word was so easy, the deed so small,&#34; she said, &#34;the&#10;joy it afforded me was infinitely great and sweet!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And therefore she does many a good deed, thinks of all in&#10;the humble cottages and in the rich mansions, where there are also&#10;afflicted ones. It is concealed and hidden, but God does not forget&#10;it. Delayed is not forgotten!&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;An old house stood there; it was in the large town with&#10;its busy traffic. There are rooms and halls in it, but we do not&#10;enter them, we remain in the kitchen, where it is warm and light,&#10;clean and tidy; the copper utensils are shining, the table as if&#10;polished with beeswax; the sink looks like a freshly scoured&#10;meatboard. All this a single servant has done, and yet she has time&#10;to spare as if she wished to go to church; she wears a bow on her&#10;cap, a black bow, that signifies mourning. But she has no one to&#10;mourn, neither father nor mother, neither relations nor sweetheart.&#10;She is a poor girl. One day she was engaged to a poor fellow; they&#10;loved each other dearly.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;One day he came to her and said:&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;We both have nothing! The rich widow over the way in the&#10;basement has made advances to me; she will make me rich, but you&#10;are in my heart; what do you advise me to do?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I advise you to do what you think will turn out to your&#10;happiness,&#34; said the girl. &#34;Be kind and good to her, but remember&#10;this; from the hour we part we shall never see each other&#10;again.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Years passed; then one day she met the old friend and&#10;sweetheart in the street; he looked ill and miserable, and she&#10;could not help asking him, &#34;How are you?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Rich and prospering in every respect,&#34; he said; &#34;the&#10;woman is brave and good, but you are in my heart. I have fought the&#10;battle, it will soon be ended; we shall not see each other again&#10;now until we meet before God!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A week has passed; this morning his death was in the&#10;newspaper, that is the reason of the girl&#39;s mourning! Her old&#10;sweetheart is dead and has left a wife and three step-children, as&#10;the paper says; it sounds as if there is a crack, but the metal is&#10;pure.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The black bow signifies mourning, the girl&#39;s face points&#10;to the same in a still higher degree; it is preserved in the heart&#10;and will never be forgotten. Delaying is not&#10;forgetting!&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;These are three stories you see, three leaves on the same&#10;stalk.

When any one takes one of these&#10;and holds it to his eye, and looks at a drop of water from the pond&#10;yonder, he sees above a thousand wonderful creatures that are&#10;otherwise never discerned in the water. But there they are, and it&#10;is no delusion. It almost looks like a great plateful of spiders&#10;jumping about in a crowd. And how fierce they are! They tear off&#10;each other&#39;s legs. and arms and bodies, before and behind; and yet&#10;they are merry and joyful in their way.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Now, there once was an old man whom all the people called&#10;Kribble-Krabble, for that was his name. He always wanted the best&#10;of everything, and when he could not manage it otherwise, he did it&#10;by magic.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;There he sat one day, and held his magnifying-glass to his&#10;eye, and looked at a drop of water that had been taken out of a&#10;puddle by the ditch. But what a kribbling and krabbling was there!&#10;All the thousands of little creatures hopped and sprang and tugged&#10;at one another, and ate each other up.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That is horrible!&#34; said old Kribble-Krabble. &#34;Can one not&#10;persuade them to live in peace and quietness, so that each one may&#10;mind his own business?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And he thought it over and over, but it would not do, and&#10;so he had recourse to magic.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I must give them color, that they may be seen more&#10;plainly,&#34; said he; and he poured something like a little drop of&#10;red wine into the drop of water, but it was witches&#39; blood from the&#10;lobes of the ear, the finest kind, at ninepence a drop. And now the&#10;wonderful little creatures were pink all over. It looked like a&#10;whole town of naked wild men.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What have you there?&#34; asked another old magician, who had&#10;no name&#8212;and that was the best thing about him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, if you can guess what it is,&#34; said Kribble-Krabble,&#10;&#34;I&#39;ll make you a present of it.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But it is not so easy to find out if one does not&#10;know.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the magician who had no name looked through the&#10;magnifying-glass.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It looked really like a great town reflected there, in&#10;which all the people were running about without clothes. It was&#10;terrible! But it was still more terrible to see how one beat and&#10;pushed the other, and bit and hacked, and tugged and mauled him.&#10;Those at the top were being pulled down, and those at the bottom&#10;were struggling upwards.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Look! look! his leg is longer than mine! Bah! Away with&#10;it! There is one who has a little bruise. It hurts him, but it&#10;shall hurt him still more.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And they hacked away at him, and they pulled at him, and&#10;ate him up, because of the little bruise. And there was one sitting&#10;as still as any little maiden, and wishing only for peace and&#10;quietness. But now she had to come out, and they tugged at her, and&#10;pulled her about, and ate her up.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That&#39;s funny!&#34; said the magician.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes; but what do you think it is?&#34; said Kribble-Krabble.&#10;&#34;Can you find that out?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Why, one can see that easily enough,&#34; said the other.&#10;&#34;That&#39;s Paris, or some other great city, for they&#39;re all alike.&#10;It&#39;s a great city!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It&#39;s a drop of puddle water!&#34; said&#10;Kribble-Krabble.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')

That was a journey, a flight without&#10;magic. We flew on the wings of steam over the sea and across the&#10;land.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Yes, our time is the time of fairy tales.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;We are in the midst of Paris, in a great hotel. Blooming&#10;flowers ornament the staircases, and soft carpets the&#10;floors.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Our room is a very cosy one, and through the open balcony&#10;door we have a view of a great square. Spring lives down there; it&#10;has come to Paris, and arrived at the same time with us. It has&#10;come in the shape of a glorious young chestnut tree, with delicate&#10;leaves newly opened. How the tree gleams, dressed in its spring&#10;garb, before all the other trees in the place! One of these latter&#10;had been struck out of the list of living trees. It lies on the&#10;ground with roots exposed. On the place where it stood, the young&#10;chestnut tree is to be planted, and to flourish.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It still stands towering aloft on the heavy wagon which&#10;has brought it this morning a distance of several miles to Paris.&#10;For years it had stood there, in the protection of a mighty oak&#10;tree, under which the old venerable clergyman had often sat, with&#10;children listening to his stories.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The young chestnut tree had also listened to the stories;&#10;for the Dryad who lived in it was a child also. She remembered the&#10;time when the tree was so little that it only projected a short way&#10;above the grass and ferns around. These were as tall as they would&#10;ever be; but the tree grew every year, and enjoyed the air and the&#10;sunshine, and drank the dew and the rain. Several times it was&#10;also, as it must be, well shaken by the wind and the rain; for that&#10;is a part of education.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Dryad rejoiced in her life, and rejoiced in the&#10;sunshine, and the singing of the birds; but she was most rejoiced&#10;at human voices; she understood the language of men as well as she&#10;understood that of animals.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Butterflies, cockchafers, dragon-flies, everything that&#10;could fly came to pay a visit. They could all talk. They told of&#10;the village, of the vineyard, of the forest, of the old castle with&#10;its parks and canals and ponds. Down in the water dwelt also living&#10;beings, which, in their way, could fly under the water from one&#10;place to another&#8212;beings with knowledge and delineation. They said&#10;nothing at all; they were so clever!&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the swallow, who had dived, told about the pretty&#10;little goldfish, of the thick turbot, the fat brill, and the old&#10;carp. The swallow could describe all that very well, but, &#34;Self is&#10;the man,&#34; she said. &#34;One ought to see these things one&#39;s self.&#34; But&#10;how was the Dryad ever to see such beings? She was obliged to be&#10;satisfied with being able to look over the beautiful country and&#10;see the busy industry of men.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was glorious; but most glorious of all when the old&#10;clergyman sat under the oak tree and talked of France, and of the&#10;great deeds of her sons and daughters, whose names will be&#10;mentioned with admiration through all time.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the Dryad heard of the shepherd girl, Joan of Arc,&#10;and of Charlotte Corday; she heard about Henry the Fourth, and&#10;Napoleon the First; she heard names whose echo sounds in the hearts&#10;of the people.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The village children listened attentively, and the Dryad&#10;no less attentively; she became a school-child with the rest. In&#10;the clouds that went sailing by she saw, picture by picture,&#10;everything that she heard talked about. The cloudy sky was her&#10;picture-book.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;She felt so happy in beautiful France, the fruitful land&#10;of genius, with the crater of freedom. But in her heart the sting&#10;remained that the bird, that every animal that could fly, was much&#10;better off than she. Even the fly could look about more in the&#10;world, far beyond the Dryad&#39;s horizon.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;France was so great and so glorious, but she could only&#10;look across a little piece of it. The land stretched out,&#10;world-wide, with vineyards, forests and great cities. Of all these&#10;Paris was the most splendid and the mightiest. The birds could get&#10;there; but she, never!&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Among the village children was a little ragged, poor girl,&#10;but a pretty one to look at. She was always laughing or singing and&#10;twining red flowers in her black hair.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Don&#39;t go to Paris!&#34; the old clergyman warned her. &#34;Poor&#10;child! if you go there, it will be your ruin.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But she went for all that.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Dryad often thought of her; for she had the same wish,&#10;and felt the same longing for the great city.&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Dryad&#39;s tree was bearing its first chestnut blossoms;&#10;the birds were twittering round them in the most beautiful&#10;sunshine. Then a stately carriage came rolling along that way, and&#10;in it sat a grand lady driving the spirited, light-footed horses.&#10;On the back seat a little smart groom balanced himself. The Dryad&#10;knew the lady, and the old clergyman knew her also. He shook his&#10;head gravely when he saw her, and said:&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;So you went there after all, and it was your ruin, poor&#10;Mary!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That one poor?&#34; thought the Dryad. &#34;No; she wears a dress&#10;fit for a countess&#34; (she had become one in the city of magic&#10;changes). &#34;Oh, if I were only there, amid all the splendor and&#10;pomp! They shine up into the very clouds at night; when I look up,&#10;I can tell in what direction the town lies.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Towards that direction the Dryad looked every evening. She&#10;saw in the dark night the gleaming cloud on the horizon; in the&#10;clear moonlight nights she missed the sailing clouds, which showed&#10;her pictures of the city and pictures from history.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The child grasps at the picture-books, the Dryad grasped&#10;at the cloud-world, her thought-book. A sudden, cloudless sky was&#10;for her a blank leaf; and for several days she had only had such&#10;leaves before her.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was in the warm summer-time: not a breeze moved through&#10;the glowing hot days. Every leaf, every flower, lay as if it were&#10;torpid, and the people seemed torpid, too.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the clouds arose and covered the region round about&#10;where the gleaming mist announced &#34;Here lies Paris.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The clouds piled themselves up like a chain of mountains,&#10;hurried on through the air, and spread themselves abroad over the&#10;whole landscape, as far as the Dryad&#39;s eye could reach.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Like enormous blue-black blocks of rock, the clouds lay&#10;piled over one another. Gleams of lightning shot forth from&#10;them.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;These also are the servants of the Lord God,&#34; the old&#10;clergyman had said. And there came a bluish dazzling flash of&#10;lightning, a lighting up as if of the sun itself, which could burst&#10;blocks of rock asunder. The lightning struck and split to the roots&#10;the old venerable oak. The crown fell asunder. It seemed as if the&#10;tree were stretching forth its arms to clasp the messengers of the&#10;light.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;No bronze cannon can sound over the land at the birth of a&#10;royal child as the thunder sounded at the death of the old oak. The&#10;rain streamed down; a refreshing wind was blowing; the storm had&#10;gone by, and there was quite a holiday glow on all things. The old&#10;clergyman spoke a few words for honorable remembrance, and a&#10;painter made a drawing, as a lasting record of the tree.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Everything passes away,&#34; said the Dryad, &#34;passes away&#10;like a cloud, and never comes back!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The old clergyman, too, did not come back. The green roof&#10;of his school was gone, and his teaching-chair had vanished. The&#10;children did not come; but autumn came, and winter came, and then&#10;spring also. In all this change of seasons the Dryad looked toward&#10;the region where, at night, Paris gleamed with its bright mist far&#10;on the horizon.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Forth from the town rushed engine after engine, train&#10;after train, whistling and screaming at all hours in the day. In&#10;the evening, towards midnight, at daybreak, and all the day&#10;through, came the trains. Out of each one, and into each one,&#10;streamed people from the country of every king. A new wonder of the&#10;world had summoned them to Paris.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In what form did this wonder exhibit itself?&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;A splendid blossom of art and industry,&#34; said one, &#34;has&#10;unfolded itself in the Champ de Mars, a gigantic sunflower, from&#10;whose petals one can learn geography and statistics, and can become&#10;as wise as a lord mayor, and raise one&#39;s self to the level of art&#10;and poetry, and study the greatness and power of the various&#10;lands.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;A fairy tale flower,&#34; said another, &#34;a many-colored&#10;lotus-plant, which spreads out its green leaves like a velvet&#10;carpet over the sand. The opening spring has brought it forth, the&#10;summer will see it in all its splendor, the autumn winds will sweep&#10;it away, so that not a leaf, not a fragment of its root shall&#10;remain.&#34;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In front of the Military School extends in time of peace&#10;the arena of war&#8212;a field without a blade of grass, a piece of sandy&#10;steppe, as if cut out of the Desert of Africa, where Fata Morgana&#10;displays her wondrous airy castles and hanging gardens. In the&#10;Champ de Mars, however, these were to be seen more splendid, more&#10;wonderful than in the East, for human art had converted the airy&#10;deceptive scenes into reality.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The Aladdin&#39;s Palace of the present has been built,&#34; it&#10;was said. &#34;Day by day, hour by hour, it unfolds more of its&#10;wonderful splendor.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The endless halls shine in marble and many colors. &#34;Master&#10;Bloodless&#34; here moves his limbs of steel and iron in the great&#10;circular hall of machinery. Works of art in metal, in stone, in&#10;Gobelins tapestry, announce the vitality of mind that is stirring&#10;in every land. Halls of paintings, splendor of flowers, everything&#10;that mind and skill can create in the workshop of the artisan, has&#10;been placed here for show. Even the memorials of ancient days, out&#10;of old graves and turf-moors, have appeared at this general&#10;meeting.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The overpowering great variegated whole must be divided&#10;into small portions, and pressed together like a plaything, if it&#10;is to be understood and described.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Like a great table on Christmas Eve, the Champ de Mars&#10;carried a wonder-castle of industry and art, and around this&#10;knickknacks from all countries had been ranged, knickknacks on a&#10;grand scale, for every nation found some remembrance of&#10;home.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Here stood the royal palace of Egypt, there the&#10;caravanserai of the desert land. The Bedouin had quitted his sunny&#10;country, and hastened by on his camel. Here stood the Russian&#10;stables, with the fiery glorious horses of the steppe. Here stood&#10;the simple straw-thatched dwelling of the Danish peasant, with the&#10;Dannebrog flag, next to Gustavus Vasa&#39;s wooden house from Dalarne,&#10;with its wonderful carvings. American huts, English cottages,&#10;French pavilions, kiosks, theatres, churches, all strewn around,&#10;and between them the fresh green turf, the clear springing water,&#10;blooming bushes, rare trees, hothouses, in which one might fancy&#10;one&#39;s self transported into the tropical forest; whole gardens&#10;brought from Damascus, and blooming under one roof. What colors,&#10;what fragrance!&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Artificial grottoes surrounded bodies of fresh or salt&#10;water, and gave a glimpse into the empire of the fishes; the&#10;visitor seemed to wander at the bottom of the sea, among fishes and&#10;polypi.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;All this,&#34; they said, &#34;the Champ de Mars offers;&#34; and&#10;around the great richly-spread table the crowd of human beings&#10;moves like a busy swarm of ants, on foot or in little carriages,&#10;for not all feet are equal to such a fatiguing journey.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Hither they swarm from morning till late in the evening.&#10;Steamer after steamer, crowded with people, glides down the Seine.&#10;The number of carriages is continually on the increase. The swarm&#10;of people on foot and on horseback grows more and more dense.&#10;Carriages and omnibuses are crowded, stuffed and embroidered with&#10;people. All these tributary streams flow in one direction&#8212;towards&#10;the Exhibition. On every entrance the flag of France is displayed;&#10;around the world&#39;s bazaar wave the flags of all nations. There is a&#10;humming and a murmuring from the hall of the machines; from the&#10;towers the melody of the chimes is heard; with the tones of the&#10;organs in the churches mingle the hoarse nasal songs from the cafes&#10;of the East. It is a kingdom of Babel, a wonder of the&#10;world!&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In very truth it was. That&#39;s what all the reports said,&#10;and who did not hear them? The Dryad knew everything that is told&#10;here of the new wonder in the city of cities.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Fly away, ye birds! fly away to see, and then come back&#10;and tell me,&#34; said the Dryad.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The wish became an intense desire&#8212;became the one thought&#10;of a life. Then, in the quiet silent night, while the full moon was&#10;shining, the Dryad saw a spark fly out of the moon&#39;s disc, and fall&#10;like a shooting star. And before the tree, whose leaves waved to&#10;and fro as if they were stirred by a tempest, stood a noble,&#10;mighty, and grand figure. In tones that were at once rich and&#10;strong, like the trumpet of the Last Judgment bidding farewell to&#10;life and summoning to the great account, it said:&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Thou shalt go to the city of magic; thou shalt take root&#10;there, and enjoy the mighty rushing breezes, the air and the&#10;sunshine there. But the time of thy life shall then be shortened;&#10;the line of years that awaited thee here amid the free nature shall&#10;shrink to but a small tale. Poor Dryad! It shall be thy&#10;destruction. Thy yearning and longing will increase, thy desire&#10;will grow more stormy, the tree itself will be as a prison to thee,&#10;thou wilt quit thy cell and give up thy nature to fly out and&#10;mingle among men. Then the years that would have belonged to thee&#10;will be contracted to half the span of the ephemeral fly, that&#10;lives but a day: one night, and thy life-taper shall be blown&#10;out&#8212;the leaves of the tree will wither and be blown away, to become&#10;green never again!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Thus the words sounded. And the light vanished away, but&#10;not the longing of the Dryad. She trembled in the wild fever of&#10;expectation.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I shall go there!&#34; she cried, rejoicingly. &#34;Life is&#10;beginning and swells like a cloud; nobody knows whither it is&#10;hastening.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;When the gray dawn arose and the moon turned pale and the&#10;clouds were tinted red, the wished-for hour struck. The words of&#10;promise were fulfilled.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;People appeared with spades and poles; they dug round the&#10;roots of the tree, deeper and deeper, and beneath it. A wagon was&#10;brought out, drawn by many horses, and the tree was lifted up, with&#10;its roots and the lumps of earth that adhered to them; matting was&#10;placed around the roots, as though the tree had its feet in a warm&#10;bag. And now the tree was lifted on the wagon and secured with&#10;chains. The journey began&#8212;the journey to Paris. There the tree was&#10;to grow as an ornament to the city of French glory.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The twigs and the leaves of the chestnut tree trembled in&#10;the first moments of its being moved; and the Dryad trembled in the&#10;pleasurable feeling of expectation.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Away! away!&#34; it sounded in every beat of her pulse.&#10;&#34;Away! away&#34; sounded in words that flew trembling along. The Dryad&#10;forgot to bid farewell to the regions of home; she thought not of&#10;the waving grass and of the innocent daisies, which had looked up&#10;to her as to a great lady, a young Princess playing at being a&#10;shepherdess out in the open air.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The chestnut tree stood upon the wagon, and nodded his&#10;branches; whether this meant &#34;farewell&#34; or &#34;forward,&#34; the Dryad&#10;knew not; she dreamed only of the marvellous new things, that&#10;seemed yet so familiar, and that were to unfold themselves before&#10;her. No child&#39;s heart rejoicing in innocence&#8212;no heart whose blood&#10;danced with passion&#8212;had set out on the journey to Paris more full&#10;of expectation than she.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Her &#34;farewell&#34; sounded in the words &#34;Away!&#10;away!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The wheels turned; the distant approached; the present&#10;vanished. The region was changed, even as the clouds change. New&#10;vineyards, forests, villages, villas appeared&#8212;came&#10;nearer&#8212;vanished!&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The chestnut tree moved forward, and the Dryad went with&#10;it. Steam-engine after steam-engine rushed past, sending up into&#10;the air vapory clouds, that formed figures which told of Paris,&#10;whence they came, and whither the Dryad was going.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Everything around knew it, and must know whither she was&#10;bound. It seemed to her as if every tree she passed stretched out&#10;its leaves towards her, with the prayer&#8212;&#34;Take me with you! take me&#10;with you!&#34; for every tree enclosed a longing Dryad.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;What changes during this flight! Houses seemed to be&#10;rising out of the earth&#8212;more and more&#8212;thicker and thicker. The&#10;chimneys rose like flower-pots ranged side by side, or in rows one&#10;above the other, on the roofs. Great inscriptions in letters a yard&#10;long, and figures in various colors, covering the walls from&#10;cornice to basement, came brightly out.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Where does Paris begin, and when shall I be there?&#34; asked&#10;the Dryad.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The crowd of people grew; the tumult and the bustle&#10;increased; carriage followed upon carriage; people on foot and&#10;people on horseback were mingled together; all around were shops on&#10;shops, music and song, crying and talking.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Dryad, in her tree, was now in the midst of Paris. The&#10;great heavy wagon all at once stopped on a little square planted&#10;with trees. The high houses around had all of them balconies to the&#10;windows, from which the inhabitants looked down upon the young&#10;fresh chestnut tree, which was coming to be planted here as a&#10;substitute for the dead tree that lay stretched on the&#10;ground.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The passers-by stood still and smiled in admiration of its&#10;pure vernal freshness. The older trees, whose buds were still&#10;closed, whispered with their waving branches, &#34;Welcome! welcome!&#34;&#10;The fountain, throwing its jet of water high up in the air, to let&#10;it fall again in the wide stone basin, told the wind to sprinkle&#10;the new-comer with pearly drops, as if it wished to give him a&#10;refreshing draught to welcome him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Dryad felt how her tree was being lifted from the&#10;wagon to be placed in the spot where it was to stand. The roots&#10;were covered with earth, and fresh turf was laid on top. Blooming&#10;shrubs and flowers in pots were ranged around; and thus a little&#10;garden arose in the square.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The tree that had been killed by the fumes of gas, the&#10;steam of kitchens, and the bad air of the city, was put upon the&#10;wagon and driven away. The passers-by looked on. Children and old&#10;men sat upon the bench, and looked at the green tree. And we who&#10;are telling this story stood upon a balcony, and looked down upon&#10;the green spring sight that had been brought in from the fresh&#10;country air, and said, what the old clergyman would have said,&#10;&#34;Poor Dryad!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I am happy! I am happy!&#34; the Dryad cried, rejoicing; &#34;and&#10;yet I cannot realize, cannot describe what I feel. Everything is as&#10;I fancied it, and yet as I did not fancy it.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The houses stood there, so lofty, so close! The sunlight&#10;shone on only one of the walls, and that one was stuck over with&#10;bills and placards, before which the people stood still; and this&#10;made a crowd.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Carriages rushed past, carriages rolled past; light ones&#10;and heavy ones mingled together. Omnibuses, those over-crowded&#10;moving houses, came rattling by; horsemen galloped among them; even&#10;carts and wagons asserted their rights.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Dryad asked herself if these high-grown houses, which&#10;stood so close around her, would not remove and take other shapes,&#10;like the clouds in the sky, and draw aside, so that she might cast&#10;a glance into Paris, and over it. Notre Dame must show itself, the&#10;Vendome Column, and the wondrous building which had called and was&#10;still calling so many strangers to the city.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But the houses did not stir from their places. It was yet&#10;day when the lamps were lit. The gas-jets gleamed from the shops,&#10;and shone even into the branches of the trees, so that it was like&#10;sunlight in summer. The stars above made their appearance, the same&#10;to which the Dryad had looked up in her home. She thought she felt&#10;a clear pure stream of air which went forth from them. She felt&#10;herself lifted up and strengthened, and felt an increased power of&#10;seeing through every leaf and through every fibre of the root. Amid&#10;all the noise and the turmoil, the colors and the lights, she knew&#10;herself watched by mild eyes.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;From the side streets sounded the merry notes of fiddles&#10;and wind instruments. Up! to the dance, to the dance! to jollity&#10;and pleasure! that was their invitation. Such music it was, that&#10;horses, carriages, trees, and houses would have danced, if they had&#10;known how. The charm of intoxicating delight filled the bosom of&#10;the Dryad.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;How glorious, how splendid it is!&#34; she cried,&#10;rejoicingly. &#34;Now I am in Paris!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The next day that dawned, the next night that fell,&#10;offered the same spectacle, similar bustle, similar life; changing,&#10;indeed, yet always the same; and thus it went on through the&#10;sequence of days.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Now I know every tree, every flower on the square here! I&#10;know every house, every balcony, every shop in this narrow cut-off&#10;corner, where I am denied the sight of this great mighty city.&#10;Where are the arches of triumph, the Boulevards, the wondrous&#10;building of the world? I see nothing of all this. As if shut up in&#10;a cage, I stand among the high houses, which I now know by heart,&#10;with their inscriptions, signs, and placards; all the painted&#10;confectionery, that is no longer to my taste. Where are all the&#10;things of which I heard, for which I longed, and for whose sake I&#10;wanted to come hither? what have I seized, found, won? I feel the&#10;same longing I felt before; I feel that there is a life I should&#10;wish to grasp and to experience. I must go out into the ranks of&#10;living men, and mingle among them. I must fly about like a bird. I&#10;must see and feel, and become human altogether. I must enjoy the&#10;one half-day, instead of vegetating for years in every-day sameness&#10;and weariness, in which I become ill, and at last sink and&#10;disappear like the dew on the meadows. I will gleam like the cloud,&#10;gleam in the sunshine of life, look out over the whole like the&#10;cloud, and pass away like it, no one knoweth whither.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Thus sighed the Dryad; and she prayed:&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Take from me the years that were destined for me, and&#10;give me but half of the life of the ephemeral fly! Deliver me from&#10;my prison! Give me human life, human happiness, only a short span,&#10;only the one night, if it cannot be otherwise; and then punish me&#10;for my wish to live, my longing for life! Strike me out of thy&#10;list. Let my shell, the fresh young tree, wither, or be hewn down,&#10;and burnt to ashes, and scattered to all the winds!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A rustling went through the leaves of the tree; there was&#10;a trembling in each of the leaves; it seemed as if fire streamed&#10;through it. A gust of wind shook its green crown, and from the&#10;midst of that crown a female figure came forth. In the same moment&#10;she was sitting beneath the brightly-illuminated leafy branches,&#10;young and beautiful to behold, like poor Mary, to whom the&#10;clergyman had said, &#34;The great city will be thy&#10;destruction.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Dryad sat at the foot of the tree&#8212;at her house door,&#10;which she had locked, and whose key had thrown away. So young! so&#10;fair! The stars saw her, and blinked at her. The gas-lamps saw her,&#10;and gleamed and beckoned to her. How delicate she was, and yet how&#10;blooming!&#8212;a child, and yet a grown maiden! Her dress was fine as&#10;silk, green as the freshly-opened leaves on the crown of the tree;&#10;in her nut-brown hair clung a half-opened chestnut blossom. She&#10;looked like the Goddess of Spring.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;For one short minute she sat motionless; then she sprang&#10;up, and, light as a gazelle, she hurried away. She ran and sprang&#10;like the reflection from the mirror that, carried by the sunshine,&#10;is cast, now here, now there. Could any one have followed her with&#10;his eyes, he would have seen how marvellously her dress and her&#10;form changed, according to the nature of the house or the place&#10;whose light happened to shine upon her.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;She reached the Boulevards. Here a sea of light streamed&#10;forth from the gas-flames of the lamps, the shops and the cafes.&#10;Here stood in a row young and slender trees, each of which&#10;concealed its Dryad, and gave shade from the artificial sunlight.&#10;The whole vast pavement was one great festive hall, where covered&#10;tables stood laden with refreshments of all kinds, from champagne&#10;and Chartreuse down to coffee and beer. Here was an exhibition of&#10;flowers, statues, books, and colored stuffs.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;From the crowd close by the lofty houses she looked forth&#10;over the terrific stream beyond the rows of trees. Yonder heaved a&#10;stream of rolling carriages, cabriolets, coaches, omnibuses, cabs,&#10;and among them riding gentlemen and marching troops. To cross to&#10;the opposite shore was an undertaking fraught with danger to life&#10;and limb. Now lanterns shed their radiance abroad; now the gas had&#10;the upper hand; suddenly a rocket rises! Whence?&#10;Whither?&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Here are sounds of soft Italian melodies; yonder, Spanish&#10;songs are sung, accompanied by the rattle of the castanets; but&#10;strongest of all, and predominating over the rest, the street-organ&#10;tunes of the moment, the exciting &#34;Can-Can&#34; music, which Orpheus&#10;never knew, and which was never heard by the &#34;Belle Helene.&#34; Even&#10;the barrow was tempted to hop upon one of its wheels.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Dryad danced, floated, flew, changing her color every&#10;moment, like a humming-bird in the sunshine; each house, with the&#10;world belonging to it, gave her its own reflections.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;As the glowing lotus-flower, torn from its stem, is&#10;carried away by the stream, so the Dryad drifted along. Whenever&#10;she paused, she was another being, so that none was able to follow&#10;her, to recognize her, or to look more closely at her.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Like cloud-pictures, all things flew by her. She looked&#10;into a thousand faces, but not one was familiar to her; she saw not&#10;a single form from home. Two bright eyes had remained in her&#10;memory. She thought of Mary, poor Mary, the ragged merry child, who&#10;wore the red flowers in her black hair. Mary was now here, in the&#10;world-city, rich and magnificent as in that day when she drove past&#10;the house of the old clergyman, and past the tree of the Dryad, the&#10;old oak.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Here she was certainly living, in the deafening tumult.&#10;Perhaps she had just stepped out of one of the gorgeous carriages&#10;in waiting. Handsome equipages, with coachmen in gold braid and&#10;footmen in silken hose, drove up. The people who alighted from them&#10;were all richly-dressed ladies. They went through the opened gate,&#10;and ascended the broad staircase that led to a building resting on&#10;marble pillars. Was this building, perhaps, the wonder of the&#10;world? There Mary would certainly be found.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Sancta Maria!&#34; resounded from the interior. Incense&#10;floated through the lofty painted and gilded aisles, where a solemn&#10;twilight reigned.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was the Church of the Madeleine.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Clad in black garments of the most costly stuffs,&#10;fashioned according to the latest mode, the rich feminine world of&#10;Paris glided across the shining pavement. The crests of the&#10;proprietors were engraved on silver shields on the velvet-bound&#10;prayer-books, and embroidered in the corners of perfumed&#10;handkerchiefs bordered with Brussels lace. A few of the ladies were&#10;kneeling in silent prayer before the altars; others resorted to the&#10;confessionals.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Anxiety and fear took possession of the Dryad; she felt as&#10;if she had entered a place where she had no right to be. Here was&#10;the abode of silence, the hall of secrets. Everything was said in&#10;whispers, every word was a mystery.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Dryad saw herself enveloped in lace and silk, like the&#10;women of wealth and of high birth around her. Had, perhaps, every&#10;one of them a longing in her breast, like the Dryad?&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A deep, painful sigh was heard. Did it escape from some&#10;confessional in a distant corner, or from the bosom of the Dryad?&#10;She drew the veil closer around her; she breathed incense, and not&#10;the fresh air. Here was not the abiding-place of her&#10;longing.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Away! away&#8212;a hastening without rest. The ephemeral fly&#10;knows not repose, for her existence is flight.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;She was out again among the gas candelabra, by a&#10;magnificent fountain.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;All its streaming waters are not able to wash out the&#10;innocent blood that was spilt here.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Such were the words spoken. Strangers stood around,&#10;carrying on a lively conversation, such as no one would have dared&#10;to carry on in the gorgeous hall of secrets whence the Dryad&#10;came.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A heavy stone slab was turned and then lifted. She did not&#10;understand why. She saw an opening that led into the depths below.&#10;The strangers stepped down, leaving the starlit air and the&#10;cheerful life of the upper world behind them.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I am afraid,&#34; said one of the women who stood around, to&#10;her husband, &#34;I cannot venture to go down, nor do I care for the&#10;wonders down yonder. You had better stay here with me.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Indeed, and travel home,&#34; said the man, &#34;and quit Paris&#10;without having seen the most wonderful thing of all&#8212;the real wonder&#10;of the present period, created by the power and resolution of one&#10;man!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I will not go down for all that,&#34; was the&#10;reply.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The wonder of the present time,&#34; it had been called. The&#10;Dryad had heard and had understood it. The goal of her ardent&#10;longing had thus been reached, and here was the entrance to it.&#10;Down into the depths below Paris? She had not thought of such a&#10;thing; but now she heard it said, and saw the strangers descending,&#10;and went after them.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The staircase was of cast iron, spiral, broad and easy.&#10;Below there burned a lamp, and farther down, another. They stood in&#10;a labyrinth of endless halls and arched passages, all communicating&#10;with each other. All the streets and lanes of Paris were to be seen&#10;here again, as in a dim reflection. The names were painted up; and&#10;every, house above had its number down here also, and struck its&#10;roots under the macadamized quays of a broad canal, in which the&#10;muddy water flowed onward. Over it the fresh streaming water was&#10;carried on arches; and quite at the top hung the tangled net of&#10;gas-pipes and telegraph-wires.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the distance lamps gleamed, like a reflection from the&#10;world-city above. Every now and then a dull rumbling was heard.&#10;This came from the heavy wagons rolling over the entrance&#10;bridges.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Whither had the Dryad come?&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;You have, no doubt, heard of the CATACOMBS? Now they are&#10;vanishing points in that new underground world&#8212;that wonder of the&#10;present day&#8212;the sewers of Paris. The Dryad was there, and not in&#10;the world&#39;s Exhibition in the Champ de Mars.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;She heard exclamations of wonder and&#10;admiration.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;From here go forth health and life for thousands upon&#10;thousands up yonder! Our time is the time of progress, with its&#10;manifold blessings.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Such was the opinion and the speech of men; but not of&#10;those creatures who had been born here, and who built and dwelt&#10;here&#8212;of the rats, namely, who were squeaking to one another in the&#10;clefts of a crumbling wall, quite plainly, and in a way the Dryad&#10;understood well.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A big old Father-Rat, with his tail bitten off, was&#10;relieving his feelings in loud squeaks; and his family gave their&#10;tribute of concurrence to every word he said:&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I am disgusted with this man-mewing,&#34; he cried&#8212;&#34;with&#10;these outbursts of ignorance. A fine magnificence, truly! all made&#10;up of gas and petroleum! I can&#39;t eat such stuff as that. Everything&#10;here is so fine and bright now, that one&#39;s ashamed of one&#39;s self,&#10;without exactly knowing why. Ah, if we only lived in the days of&#10;tallow candles! and it does not lie so very far behind us. That was&#10;a romantic time, as one may say.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What are you talking of there?&#34; asked the Dryad. &#34;I have&#10;never seen you before. What is it you are talking&#10;about?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Of the glorious days that are gone,&#34; said the Rat&#8212;&#34;of the&#10;happy time of our great-grandfathers and great-grandmothers. Then&#10;it was a great thing to get down here. That was a rat&#39;s nest quite&#10;different from Paris. Mother Plague used to live here then; she&#10;killed people, but never rats. Robbers and smugglers could breathe&#10;freely here. Here was the meeting-place of the most interesting&#10;personages, whom one now only gets to see in the theatres where&#10;they act melodrama, up above. The time of romance is gone even in&#10;our rat&#39;s nest; and here also fresh air and petroleum have broken&#10;in.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Thus squeaked the Rat; he squeaked in honor of the old&#10;time, when Mother Plague was still alive.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A carriage stopped, a kind of open omnibus, drawn by swift&#10;horses. The company mounted and drove away along the Boulevard de&#10;Sebastopol, that is to say, the underground boulevard, over which&#10;the well-known crowded street of that name extended.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The carriage disappeared in the twilight; the Dryad&#10;disappeared, lifted to the cheerful freshness above. Here, and not&#10;below in the vaulted passages, filled with heavy air, the wonder&#10;work must be found which she was to seek in her short lifetime. It&#10;must gleam brighter than all the gas-flames, stronger than the moon&#10;that was just gliding past.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Yes, certainly, she saw it yonder in the distance, it&#10;gleamed before her, and twinkled and glittered like the evening&#10;star in the sky.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;She saw a glittering portal open, that led to a little&#10;garden, where all was brightness and dance music. Colored lamps&#10;surrounded little lakes, in which were water-plants of colored&#10;metal, from whose flowers jets of water spurted up. Beautiful&#10;weeping willows, real products of spring, hung their fresh branches&#10;over these lakes like a fresh, green, transparent, and yet&#10;screening veil. In the bushes burnt an open fire, throwing a red&#10;twilight over the quiet huts of branches, into which the sounds of&#10;music penetrated&#8212;an ear tickling, intoxicating music, that sent the&#10;blood coursing through the veins.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Beautiful girls in festive attire, with pleasant smiles on&#10;their lips, and the light spirit of youth in their hearts&#8212;&#34;Marys,&#34;&#10;with roses in their hair, but without carriage and&#10;postilion&#8212;flitted to and fro in the wild dance.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Where were the heads, where the feet? As if stung by&#10;tarantulas, they sprang, laughed, rejoiced, as if in their&#10;ecstacies they were going to embrace all the world.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Dryad felt herself torn with them into the whirl of&#10;the dance. Round her delicate foot clung the silken boot, chestnut&#10;brown in color, like the ribbon that floated from her hair down&#10;upon her bare shoulders. The green silk dress waved in large folds,&#10;but did not entirely hide the pretty foot and ankle.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Had she come to the enchanted Garden of Armida? What was&#10;the name of the place?&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The name glittered in gas-jets over the entrance. It was&#10;&#34;Mabille.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The soaring upwards of rockets, the splashing of&#10;fountains, and the popping of champagne corks accompanied the wild&#10;bacchantic dance. Over the whole glided the moon through the air,&#10;clear, but with a somewhat crooked face.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A wild joviality seemed to rush through the Dryad, as&#10;though she were intoxicated with opium. Her eyes spoke, her lips&#10;spoke, but the sound of violins and of flutes drowned the sound of&#10;her voice. Her partner whispered words to her which she did not&#10;understand, nor do we understand them. He stretched out his arms to&#10;draw her to him, but he embraced only the empty air.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Dryad had been carried away, like a rose-leaf on the&#10;wind. Before her she saw a flame in the air, a flashing light high&#10;up on a tower. The beacon light shone from the goal of her longing,&#10;shone from the red lighthouse tower of the Fata Morgana of the&#10;Champ de Mars. Thither she was carried by the wind. She circled&#10;round the tower; the workmen thought it was a butterfly that had&#10;come too early, and that now sank down dying.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The moon shone bright, gas-lamps spread light around,&#10;through the halls, over the all-world&#39;s buildings scattered about,&#10;over the rose-hills and the rocks produced by human ingenuity, from&#10;which waterfalls, driven by the power of &#34;Master Bloodless,&#34; fell&#10;down. The caverns of the sea, the depths of the lakes, the kingdom&#10;of the fishes were opened here. Men walked as in the depths of the&#10;deep pond, and held converse with the sea, in the diving-bell of&#10;glass. The water pressed against the strong glass walls above and&#10;on every side. The polypi, eel-like living creatures, had fastened&#10;themselves to the bottom, and stretched out arms, fathoms long, for&#10;prey. A big turbot was making himself broad in front, quietly&#10;enough, but not without casting some suspicious glances aside. A&#10;crab clambered over him, looking like a gigantic spider, while the&#10;shrimps wandered about in restless haste, like the butterflies and&#10;moths of the sea.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the fresh water grew water-lilies, nymphaea, and reeds;&#10;the gold-fishes stood up below in rank and file, all turning their&#10;heads one way, that the streaming water might flow into their&#10;mouths. Fat carps stared at the glass wall with stupid eyes. They&#10;knew that they were here to be exhibited, and that they had made&#10;the somewhat toilsome journey hither in tubs filled with water; and&#10;they thought with dismay of the land-sickness from which they had&#10;suffered so cruelly on the railway.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;They had come to see the Exhibition, and now contemplated&#10;it from their fresh or salt-water position. They looked attentively&#10;at the crowds of people who passed by them early and late. All the&#10;nations in the world, they thought, had made an exhibition of their&#10;inhabitants, for the edification of the soles and haddocks, pike&#10;and carp, that they might give their opinions upon the different&#10;kinds.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Those are scaly animals&#34; said a little slimy Whiting.&#10;&#34;They put on different scales two or three times a day, and they&#10;emit sounds which they call speaking. We don&#39;t put on scales, and&#10;we make ourselves understood in an easier way, simply by twitching&#10;the corners of our mouths and staring with our eyes. We have a&#10;great many advantages over mankind.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But they have learned swimming of us,&#34; remarked a&#10;well-educated Codling. &#34;You must know I come from the great sea&#10;outside. In the hot time of the year the people yonder go into the&#10;water; first they take off their scales, and then they swim. They&#10;have learnt from the frogs to kick out with their hind legs, and&#10;row with their fore paws. But they cannot hold out long. They want&#10;to be like us, but they cannot come up to us. Poor&#10;people!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the fishes stared. They thought that the whole swarm&#10;of people whom they had seen in the bright daylight were still&#10;moving around them; they were certain they still saw the same forms&#10;that had first caught their attention.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A pretty Barbel, with spotted skin, and an enviably round&#10;back, declared that the &#34;human fry&#34; were still there.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I can see a well set-up human figure quite well,&#34; said&#10;the Barbel. &#34;She was called &#39;contumacious lady,&#39; or something of&#10;that kind. She had a mouth and staring eyes, like ours, and a great&#10;balloon at the back of her head, and something like a shut-up&#10;umbrella in front; there were a lot of dangling bits of seaweed&#10;hanging about her. She ought to take all the rubbish off, and go as&#10;we do; then she would look something like a respectable barbel, so&#10;far as it is possible for a person to look like one!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What&#39;s become of that one whom they drew away with the&#10;hook? He sat on a wheel-chair, and had paper, and pen, and ink, and&#10;wrote down everything. They called him a &#39;writer.&#39;&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;They&#39;re going about with him still,&#34; said a hoary old&#10;maid of a Carp, who carried her misfortune about with her, so that&#10;she was quite hoarse. In her youth she had once swallowed a hook,&#10;and still swam patiently about with it in her gullet. &#34;A writer?&#10;That means, as we fishes describe it, a kind of cuttle or ink-fish&#10;among men.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Thus the fishes gossipped in their own way; but in the&#10;artificial water-grotto the laborers were busy; who were obliged to&#10;take advantage of the hours of night to get their work done by&#10;daybreak. They accompanied with blows of their hammers and with&#10;songs the parting words of the vanishing Dryad.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;So, at any rate, I have seen you, you pretty&#10;gold-fishes,&#34; she said. &#34;Yes, I know you;&#34; and she waved her hand&#10;to them. &#34;I have known about you a long time in my home; the&#10;swallow told me about you. How beautiful you are! how delicate and&#10;shining! I should like to kiss every one of you. You others, also.&#10;I know you all; but you do not know me.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The fishes stared out into the twilight. They did not&#10;understand a word of it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Dryad was there no longer. She had been a long time in&#10;the open air, where the different countries&#8212;the country of black&#10;bread, the codfish coast, the kingdom of Russia leather, and the&#10;banks of eau-de-Cologne, and the gardens of rose oil&#8212;exhaled their&#10;perfumes from the world-wonder flower.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;When, after a night at a ball, we drive home half asleep&#10;and half awake, the melodies still sound plainly in our ears; we&#10;hear them, and could sing them all from memory. When the eye of the&#10;murdered man closes, the picture of what it saw last clings to it&#10;for a time like a photographic picture.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;So it was likewise here. The bustling life of day had not&#10;yet disappeared in the quiet night. The Dryad had seen it; she&#10;knew, thus it will be repeated tomorrow.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Dryad stood among the fragrant roses, and thought she&#10;knew them, and had seen them in her own home. She also saw red&#10;pomegranate flowers, like those that little Mary had worn in her&#10;dark hair.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Remembrances from the home of her childhood flashed&#10;through her thoughts; her eyes eagerly drank in the prospect&#10;around, and feverish restlessness chased her through the&#10;wonder-filled halls.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A weariness that increased continually, took possession of&#10;her. She felt a longing to rest on the soft Oriental carpets&#10;within, or to lean against the weeping willow without by the clear&#10;water. But for the ephemeral fly there was no rest. In a few&#10;moments the day had completed its circle.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Her thoughts trembled, her limbs trembled, she sank down&#10;on the grass by the bubbling water.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Thou wilt ever spring living from the earth,&#34; she said&#10;mournfully. &#34;Moisten my tongue&#8212;bring me a refreshing&#10;draught.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I am no living water,&#34; was the answer. &#34;I only spring&#10;upward when the machine wills it.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Give me something of thy freshness, thou green grass,&#34;&#10;implored the Dryad; &#34;give me one of thy fragrant&#10;flowers.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;We must die if we are torn from our stalks,&#34; replied the&#10;Flowers and the Grass.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Give me a kiss, thou fresh stream of air&#8212;only a single&#10;life-kiss.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Soon the sun will kiss the clouds red,&#34; answered the&#10;Wind; &#34;then thou wilt be among the dead&#8212;blown away, as all the&#10;splendor here will be blown away before the year shall have ended.&#10;Then I can play again with the light loose sand on the place here,&#10;and whirl the dust over the land and through the air. All is&#10;dust!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Dryad felt a terror like a woman who has cut asunder&#10;her pulse-artery in the bath, but is filled again with the love of&#10;life, even while she is bleeding to death. She raised herself,&#10;tottered forward a few steps, and sank down again at the entrance&#10;to a little church. The gate stood open, lights were burning upon&#10;the altar, and the organ sounded.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;What music! Such notes the Dryad had never yet heard; and&#10;yet it seemed to her as if she recognized a number of well-known&#10;voices among them. They came deep from the heart of all creation.&#10;She thought she heard the stories of the old clergyman, of great&#10;deeds, and of the celebrated names, and of the gifts that the&#10;creatures of God must bestow upon posterity, if they would live on&#10;in the world.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The tones of the organ swelled, and in their song there&#10;sounded these words:&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Thy wishing and thy longing have torn thee, with thy&#10;roots, from the place which God appointed for thee. That was thy&#10;destruction, thou poor Dryad!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The notes became soft and gentle, and seemed to die away&#10;in a wail.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the sky the clouds showed themselves with a ruddy&#10;gleam. The Wind sighed:&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Pass away, ye dead! now the sun is going to&#10;rise!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The first ray fell on the Dryad. Her form was irradiated&#10;in changing colors, like the soap-bubble when it is bursting and&#10;becomes a drop of water; like a tear that falls and passes away&#10;like a vapor.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Poor Dryad! Only a dew-drop, only a tear, poured upon the&#10;earth, and vanished away! &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode(''), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;FAR in the interior of the country lay an old baronial&#10;hall, and in it lived an old proprietor, who had two sons, which&#10;two young men thought themselves too clever by half. They wanted to&#10;go out and woo the King&#39;s daughter; for the maiden in question had&#10;publicly announced that she would choose for her husband that youth&#10;who could arrange his words best.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;So these two geniuses prepared themselves a full week for&#10;the wooing&#8212;this was the longest time that could be granted them;&#10;but it was enough, for they had had much preparatory information,&#10;and everybody knows how useful that is. One of them knew the whole&#10;Latin dictionary by heart, and three whole years of the daily paper&#10;of the little town into the bargain, and so well, indeed, that he&#10;could repeat it all either backwards or forwards, just as he chose.&#10;The other was deeply read in the corporation laws, and knew by&#10;heart what every corporation ought to know; and accordingly he&#10;thought he could talk of affairs of state, and put his spoke in the&#10;wheel in the council. And he knew one thing more: he could&#10;embroider suspenders with roses and other flowers, and with&#10;arabesques, for he was a tasty, light-fingered fellow.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I shall win the Princess!&#34; So cried both of them.&#10;Therefore their old papa gave to each of them a handsome horse. The&#10;youth who knew the dictionary and newspaper by heart had a black&#10;horse, and he who knew all about the corporation laws received a&#10;milk-white steed. Then they rubbed the corners of their mouths with&#10;fish-oil, so that they might become very smooth and glib. All the&#10;servants stood below in the courtyard, and looked on while they&#10;mounted their horses; and just by chance the third son came up. For&#10;the proprietor had really three sons, though nobody counted the&#10;third with his brothers, because he was not so learned as they, and&#10;indeed he was generally known as &#34;Jack the Dullard.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Hallo!&#34; said Jack the Dullard, &#34;where are you going? I&#10;declare you have put on your Sunday clothes!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;We&#39;re going to the King&#39;s court, as suitors to the King&#39;s&#10;daughter. Don&#39;t you know the announcement that has been made all&#10;through the country?&#34; And they told him all about it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;My word! I&#39;ll be in it too!&#34; cried Jack the Dullard; and&#10;his two brothers burst out laughing at him, and rode&#10;away.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Father, dear,&#34; said Jack, &#34;I must have a horse too. I do&#10;feel so desperately inclined to marry! If she accepts me, she&#10;accepts me; and if she won&#39;t have me, I&#39;ll have her; but she shall&#10;be mine!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Don&#39;t talk nonsense,&#34; replied the old gentleman. &#34;You&#10;shall have no horse from me. You don&#39;t know how to speak&#8212;you can&#39;t&#10;arrange your words. Your brothers are very different fellows from&#10;you.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Well,&#34; quoth Jack the Dullard, &#34;If I can&#39;t have a horse,&#10;I&#39;ll take the Billy-goat, who belongs to me, and he can carry me&#10;very well!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And so said, so done. He mounted the Billy-goat, pressed&#10;his heels into its sides, and galloped down the high street like a&#10;hurricane.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Hei, houp! that was a ride! Here I come!&#34; shouted Jack&#10;the Dullard, and he sang till his voice echoed far and&#10;wide.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But his brothers rode slowly on in advance of him. They&#10;spoke not a word, for they were thinking about the fine extempore&#10;speeches they would have to bring out, and these had to be cleverly&#10;prepared beforehand.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Hallo!&#34; shouted Jack the Dullard. &#34;Here am I! Look what I&#10;have found on the high road.&#34; And he showed them what it was, and&#10;it was a dead crow.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Dullard!&#34; exclaimed the brothers, &#34;what are you going to&#10;do with that?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;With the crow? why, I am going to give it to the&#10;Princess.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, do so,&#34; said they; and they laughed, and rode&#10;on.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Hallo, here I am again! just see what I have found now:&#10;you don&#39;t find that on the high road every day!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the brothers turned round to see what he could have&#10;found now.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Dullard!&#34; they cried, &#34;that is only an old wooden shoe,&#10;and the upper part is missing into the bargain; are you going to&#10;give that also to the Princess?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Most certainly I shall,&#34; replied Jack the Dullard; and&#10;again the brothers laughed and rode on, and thus they got far in&#10;advance of him; but&#8212;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Hallo&#8212;hop rara!&#34; and there was Jack the Dullard again.&#10;&#34;It is getting better and better,&#34; he cried. &#34;Hurrah! it is quite&#10;famous.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Why, what have you found this time?&#34; inquired the&#10;brothers.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh,&#34; said Jack the Dullard, &#34;I can hardly tell you. How&#10;glad the Princess will be!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Bah!&#34; said the brothers; &#34;that is nothing but clay out of&#10;the ditch.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, certainly it is,&#34; said Jack the Dullard; &#34;and clay&#10;of the finest sort. See, it is so wet, it runs through one&#39;s&#10;fingers.&#34; And he filled his pocket with the clay.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But his brothers galloped on till the sparks flew, and&#10;consequently they arrived a full hour earlier at the town gate than&#10;could Jack. Now at the gate each suitor was provided with a number,&#10;and all were placed in rows immediately on their arrival, six in&#10;each row, and so closely packed together that they could not move&#10;their arms; and that was a prudent arrangement, for they would&#10;certainly have come to blows, had they been able, merely because&#10;one of them stood before the other.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;All the inhabitants of the country round about stood in&#10;great crowds around the castle, almost under the very windows, to&#10;see the Princess receive the suitors; and as each stepped into the&#10;hall, his power of speech seemed to desert him, like the light of a&#10;candle that is blown out. Then the Princess would say, &#34;He is of no&#10;use! Away with him out of the hall!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;At last the turn came for that brother who knew the&#10;dictionary by heart; but he did not know it now; he had absolutely&#10;forgotten it altogether; and the boards seemed to re-echo with his&#10;footsteps, and the ceiling of the hall was made of looking-glass,&#10;so that he saw himself standing on his head; and at the window&#10;stood three clerks and a head clerk, and every one of them was&#10;writing down every single word that was uttered, so that it might&#10;be printed in the newspapers, and sold for a penny at the street&#10;corners. It was a terrible ordeal, and they had, moreover, made&#10;such a fire in the stove, that the room seemed quite red&#10;hot.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It is dreadfully hot here!&#34; observed the first&#10;brother.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes,&#34; replied the Princess, &#34;my father is going to roast&#10;young pullets today.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Baa!&#34; there he stood like a baa-lamb. He had not been&#10;prepared for a speech of this kind, and had not a word to say,&#10;though he intended to say something witty. &#34;Baa!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;He is of no use!&#34; said the Princess. &#34;Away with&#10;him!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And he was obliged to go accordingly. And now the second&#10;brother came in.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It is terribly warm here!&#34; he observed.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, we&#39;re roasting pullets to-day,&#34; replied the&#10;Princess.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What&#8212;what were you&#8212;were you pleased to ob-&#34; stammered&#10;he&#8212;and all the clerks wrote down, &#34;pleased to ob-&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;He is of no use!&#34; said the Princess. &#34;Away with&#10;him!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Now came the turn of Jack the Dullard. He rode into the&#10;hall on his goat.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Well, it&#39;s most abominably hot here.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, because I&#39;m roasting young pullets,&#34; replied the&#10;Princess.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ah, that&#39;s lucky!&#34; exclaimed Jack the Dullard, &#34;for I&#10;suppose you&#39;ll let me roast my crow at the same time?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;With the greatest pleasure,&#34; said the Princess. &#34;But have&#10;you anything you can roast it in? for I have neither pot nor&#10;pan.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Certainly I have!&#34; said Jack. &#34;Here&#39;s a cooking utensil&#10;with a tin handle.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And he brought out the old wooden shoe, and put the crow&#10;into it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Well, that is a famous dish!&#34; said the Princess. &#34;But&#10;what shall we do for sauce?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, I have that in my pocket,&#34; said Jack; &#34;I have so much&#10;of it that I can afford to throw some away;&#34; and he poured some of&#10;the clay out of his pocket.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I like that!&#34; said the Princess. &#34;You can give an answer,&#10;and you have something to say for yourself, and so you shall be my&#10;husband. But are you aware that every word we speak is being taken&#10;down, and will be published in the paper to-morrow? Look yonder,&#10;and you will see in every window three clerks and a head clerk; and&#10;the old head clerk is the worst of all, for he can&#39;t understand&#10;anything.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But she only said this to frighten Jack the Dullard; and&#10;the clerks gave a great crow of delight, and each one spurted a&#10;blot out of his pen on to the floor.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, those are the gentlemen, are they?&#34; said Jack; &#34;then&#10;I will give the best I have to the head clerk.&#34; And he turned out&#10;his pockets, and flung the wet clay full in the head clerk&#39;s&#10;face.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That was very cleverly done,&#34; observed the Princess. &#34;I&#10;could not have done that; but I shall learn in time.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And accordingly Jack the Dullard was made a king, and&#10;received a crown and a wife, and sat upon a throne. And this report&#10;we have wet from the press of the head clerk and the corporation of&#10;printers&#8212;but they are not to be depended upon in the least.&#10;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode(''), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;IN the high-road which led through a wood stood a solitary&#10;farm-house; the road, in fact, ran right through its yard. The sun&#10;was shining and all the windows were open; within the house people&#10;were very busy. In the yard, in an arbour formed by lilac bushes in&#10;full bloom, stood an open coffin; thither they had carried a dead&#10;man, who was to be buried that very afternoon. Nobody shed a tear&#10;over him; his face was covered over with a white cloth, under his&#10;head they had placed a large thick book, the leaves of which&#10;consisted of folded sheets of blotting-paper, and withered flowers&#10;lay between them; it was the herbarium which he had gathered in&#10;various places and was to be buried with him, according to his own&#10;wish. Every one of the flowers in it was connected with some&#10;chapter of his life.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Who is the dead man?&#34; we asked.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The old student,&#34; was the reply. &#34;They say that he was&#10;once an energetic young man, that he studied the dead languages,&#10;and sang and even composed many songs; then something had happened&#10;to him, and in consequence of this he gave himself up to drink,&#10;body and mind. When at last he had ruined his health, they brought&#10;him into the country, where someone paid for his board and&#10;residence. He was gentle as a child as long as the sullen mood did&#10;not come over him; but when it came he was fierce, became as strong&#10;as a giant, and ran about in the wood like a chased deer. But when&#10;we succeeded in bringing him home, and prevailed upon him to open&#10;the book with the dried-up plants in it, he would sometimes sit for&#10;a whole day looking at this or that plant, while frequently the&#10;tears rolled over his cheeks. God knows what was in his mind; but&#10;he requested us to put the book into his coffin, and now he lies&#10;there. In a little while the lid will be placed upon the coffin,&#10;and he will have sweet rest in the grave!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The cloth which covered his face was lifted up; the dead&#10;man&#39;s face expressed peace&#8212;a sunbeam fell upon it. A swallow flew&#10;with the swiftness of an arrow into the arbour, turning in its&#10;flight, and twittered over the dead man&#39;s head.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;What a strange feeling it is&#8212;surely we all know it&#8212;to look&#10;through old letters of our young days; a different life rises up&#10;out of the past, as it were, with all its hopes and sorrows. How&#10;many of the people with whom in those days we used to be on&#10;intimate terms appear to us as if dead, and yet they are still&#10;alive&#8212;only we have not thought of them for such a long time, whom&#10;we imagined we should retain in our memories for ever, and share&#10;every joy and sorrow with them.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The withered oak leaf in the book here recalled the&#10;friend, the schoolfellow, who was to be his friend for life. He&#10;fixed the leaf to the student&#39;s cap in the green wood, when they&#10;vowed eternal friendship. Where does he dwell now? The leaf is&#10;kept, but the friendship does no longer exist. Here is a foreign&#10;hothouse plant, too tender for the gardens of the North. It is&#10;almost as if its leaves still smelt sweet! She gave it to him out&#10;of her own garden&#8212;a nobleman&#39;s daughter.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Here is a water-lily that he had plucked himself, and&#10;watered with salt tears&#8212;a lily of sweet water. And here is a&#10;nettle: what may its leaves tell us? What might he have thought&#10;when he plucked and kept it? Here is a little snowdrop out of the&#10;solitary wood; here is an evergreen from the flower-pot at the&#10;tavern; and here is a simple blade of grass.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The lilac bends its fresh fragrant flowers over the dead&#10;man&#39;s head; the swallow passes again&#8212;&#34;twit, twit;&#34; now the men come&#10;with hammer and nails, the lid is placed over the dead man, while&#10;his head rests on the dumb book&#8212;so long cherished, now closed for&#10;ever! &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')

He was&#10;such a little wee thing, that no human eye could see him. Behind&#10;each leaf of the rose he had a sleeping chamber. He was as well&#10;formed and as beautiful as a little child could be, and had wings&#10;that reached from his shoulders to his feet. Oh, what sweet&#10;fragrance there was in his chambers! and how clean and beautiful&#10;were the walls! for they were the blushing leaves of the&#10;rose.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;During the whole day he enjoyed himself in the warm&#10;sunshine, flew from flower to flower, and danced on the wings of&#10;the flying butterflies. Then he took it into his head to measure&#10;how many steps he would have to go through the roads and&#10;cross-roads that are on the leaf of a linden-tree. What we call the&#10;veins on a leaf, he took for roads; ay, and very long roads they&#10;were for him; for before he had half finished his task, the sun&#10;went down: he had commenced his work too late. It became very cold,&#10;the dew fell, and the wind blew; so he thought the best thing he&#10;could do would be to return home. He hurried himself as much as he&#10;could; but he found the roses all closed up, and he could not get&#10;in; not a single rose stood open. The poor little elf was very much&#10;frightened. He had never before been out at night, but had always&#10;slumbered secretly behind the warm rose-leaves. Oh, this would&#10;certainly be his death. At the other end of the garden, he knew&#10;there was an arbor, overgrown with beautiful honey-suckles. The&#10;blossoms looked like large painted horns; and he thought to&#10;himself, he would go and sleep in one of these till the morning. He&#10;flew thither; but &#34;hush!&#34; two people were in the arbor,&#8212;a handsome&#10;young man and a beautiful lady. They sat side by side, and wished&#10;that they might never be obliged to part. They loved each other&#10;much more than the best child can love its father and&#10;mother.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But we must part,&#34; said the young man; &#34;your brother does&#10;not like our engagement, and therefore he sends me so far away on&#10;business, over mountains and seas. Farewell, my sweet bride; for so&#10;you are to me.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And then they kissed each other, and the girl wept, and&#10;gave him a rose; but before she did so, she pressed a kiss upon it&#10;so fervently that the flower opened. Then the little elf flew in,&#10;and leaned his head on the delicate, fragrant walls. Here he could&#10;plainly hear them say, &#34;Farewell, farewell;&#34; and he felt that the&#10;rose had been placed on the young man&#39;s breast. Oh, how his heart&#10;did beat! The little elf could not go to sleep, it thumped so&#10;loudly. The young man took it out as he walked through the dark&#10;wood alone, and kissed the flower so often and so violently, that&#10;the little elf was almost crushed. He could feel through the leaf&#10;how hot the lips of the young man were, and the rose had opened, as&#10;if from the heat of the noonday sun.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;There came another man, who looked gloomy and wicked. He&#10;was the wicked brother of the beautiful maiden. He drew out a sharp&#10;knife, and while the other was kissing the rose, the wicked man&#10;stabbed him to death; then he cut off his head, and buried it with&#10;the body in the soft earth under the linden-tree.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Now he is gone, and will soon be forgotten,&#34; thought the&#10;wicked brother; &#34;he will never come back again. He was going on a&#10;long journey over mountains and seas; it is easy for a man to lose&#10;his life in such a journey. My sister will suppose he is dead; for&#10;he cannot come back, and she will not dare to question me about&#10;him.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then he scattered the dry leaves over the light earth with&#10;his foot, and went home through the darkness; but he went not&#10;alone, as he thought,&#8212;the little elf accompanied him. He sat in a&#10;dry rolled-up linden-leaf, which had fallen from the tree on to the&#10;wicked man&#39;s head, as he was digging the grave. The hat was on the&#10;head now, which made it very dark, and the little elf shuddered&#10;with fright and indignation at the wicked deed.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was the dawn of morning before the wicked man reached&#10;home; he took off his hat, and went into his sister&#39;s room. There&#10;lay the beautiful, blooming girl, dreaming of him whom she loved&#10;so, and who was now, she supposed, travelling far away over&#10;mountain and sea. Her wicked brother stopped over her, and laughed&#10;hideously, as fiends only can laugh. The dry leaf fell out of his&#10;hair upon the counterpane; but he did not notice it, and went to&#10;get a little sleep during the early morning hours. But the elf&#10;slipped out of the withered leaf, placed himself by the ear of the&#10;sleeping girl, and told her, as in a dream, of the horrid murder;&#10;described the place where her brother had slain her lover, and&#10;buried his body; and told her of the linden-tree, in full blossom,&#10;that stood close by.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That you may not think this is only a dream that I have&#10;told you,&#34; he said, &#34;you will find on your bed a withered&#10;leaf.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then she awoke, and found it there. Oh, what bitter tears&#10;she shed! and she could not open her heart to any one for&#10;relief.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The window stood open the whole day, and the little elf&#10;could easily have reached the roses, or any of the flowers; but he&#10;could not find it in his heart to leave one so afflicted. In the&#10;window stood a bush bearing monthly roses. He seated himself in one&#10;of the flowers, and gazed on the poor girl. Her brother often came&#10;into the room, and would be quite cheerful, in spite of his base&#10;conduct; so she dare not say a word to him of her heart&#39;s&#10;grief.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;As soon as night came on, she slipped out of the house,&#10;and went into the wood, to the spot where the linden-tree stood;&#10;and after removing the leaves from the earth, she turned it up, and&#10;there found him who had been murdered. Oh, how she wept and prayed&#10;that she also might die! Gladly would she have taken the body home&#10;with her; but that was impossible; so she took up the poor head&#10;with the closed eyes, kissed the cold lips, and shook the mould out&#10;of the beautiful hair.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I will keep this,&#34; said she; and as soon as she had&#10;covered the body again with the earth and leaves, she took the head&#10;and a little sprig of jasmine that bloomed in the wood, near the&#10;spot where he was buried, and carried them home with her. As soon&#10;as she was in her room, she took the largest flower-pot she could&#10;find, and in this she placed the head of the dead man, covered it&#10;up with earth, and planted the twig of jasmine in it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Farewell, farewell,&#34; whispered the little elf. He could&#10;not any longer endure to witness all this agony of grief, he&#10;therefore flew away to his own rose in the garden. But the rose was&#10;faded; only a few dry leaves still clung to the green hedge behind&#10;it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Alas! how soon all that is good and beautiful passes&#10;away,&#34; sighed the elf.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;After a while he found another rose, which became his&#10;home, for among its delicate fragrant leaves he could dwell in&#10;safety. Every morning he flew to the window of the poor girl, and&#10;always found her weeping by the flower pot. The bitter tears fell&#10;upon the jasmine twig, and each day, as she became paler and paler,&#10;the sprig appeared to grow greener and fresher. One shoot after&#10;another sprouted forth, and little white buds blossomed, which the&#10;poor girl fondly kissed. But her wicked brother scolded her, and&#10;asked her if she was going mad. He could not imagine why she was&#10;weeping over that flower-pot, and it annoyed him. He did not know&#10;whose closed eyes were there, nor what red lips were fading beneath&#10;the earth. And one day she sat and leaned her head against the&#10;flower-pot, and the little elf of the rose found her asleep. Then&#10;he seated himself by her ear, talked to her of that evening in the&#10;arbor, of the sweet perfume of the rose, and the loves of the&#10;elves. Sweetly she dreamed, and while she dreamt, her life passed&#10;away calmly and gently, and her spirit was with him whom she loved,&#10;in heaven. And the jasmine opened its large white bells, and spread&#10;forth its sweet fragrance; it had no other way of showing its grief&#10;for the dead. But the wicked brother considered the beautiful&#10;blooming plant as his own property, left to him by his sister, and&#10;he placed it in his sleeping room, close by his bed, for it was&#10;very lovely in appearance, and the fragrance sweet and delightful.&#10;The little elf of the rose followed it, and flew from flower to&#10;flower, telling each little spirit that dwelt in them the story of&#10;the murdered young man, whose head now formed part of the earth&#10;beneath them, and of the wicked brother and the poor sister. &#34;We&#10;know it,&#34; said each little spirit in the flowers, &#34;we know it, for&#10;have we not sprung from the eyes and lips of the murdered one. We&#10;know it, we know it,&#34; and the flowers nodded with their heads in a&#10;peculiar manner. The elf of the rose could not understand how they&#10;could rest so quietly in the matter, so he flew to the bees, who&#10;were gathering honey, and told them of the wicked brother. And the&#10;bees told it to their queen, who commanded that the next morning&#10;they should go and kill the murderer. But during the night, the&#10;first after the sister&#39;s death, while the brother was sleeping in&#10;his bed, close to where he had placed the fragrant jasmine, every&#10;flower cup opened, and invisibly the little spirits stole out,&#10;armed with poisonous spears. They placed themselves by the ear of&#10;the sleeper, told him dreadful dreams and then flew across his&#10;lips, and pricked his tongue with their poisoned spears. &#34;Now have&#10;we revenged the dead,&#34; said they, and flew back into the white&#10;bells of the jasmine flowers. When the morning came, and as soon as&#10;the window was opened, the rose elf, with the queen bee, and the&#10;whole swarm of bees, rushed in to kill him. But he was already&#10;dead. People were standing round the bed, and saying that the scent&#10;of the jasmine had killed him. Then the elf of the rose understood&#10;the revenge of the flowers, and explained it to the queen bee, and&#10;she, with the whole swarm, buzzed about the flower-pot. The bees&#10;could not be driven away. Then a man took it up to remove it, and&#10;one of the bees stung him in the hand, so that he let the&#10;flower-pot fall, and it was broken to pieces. Then every one saw&#10;the whitened skull, and they knew the dead man in the bed was a&#10;murderer. And the queen bee hummed in the air, and sang of the&#10;revenge of the flowers, and of the elf of the rose and said that&#10;behind the smallest leaf dwells One, who can discover evil deeds,&#10;and punish them also. &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode(''), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A FEW large lizards were running nimbly about in the&#10;clefts of an old tree; they could understand one another very well,&#10;for they spoke the lizard language.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What a buzzing and a rumbling there is in the elfin&#10;hill,&#34; said one of the lizards; &#34;I have not been able to close my&#10;eyes for two nights on account of the noise; I might just as well&#10;have had the toothache, for that always keeps me awake.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;There is something going on within there,&#34; said the other&#10;lizard; &#34;they propped up the top of the hill with four red posts,&#10;till cock-crow this morning, so that it is thoroughly aired, and&#10;the elfin girls have learnt new dances; there is&#10;something.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I spoke about it to an earth-worm of my acquaintance,&#34;&#10;said a third lizard; &#34;the earth-worm had just come from the elfin&#10;hill, where he has been groping about in the earth day and night.&#10;He has heard a great deal; although he cannot see, poor miserable&#10;creature, yet he understands very well how to wriggle and lurk&#10;about. They expect friends in the elfin hill, grand company, too;&#10;but who they are the earth-worm would not say, or, perhaps, he&#10;really did not know. All the will-o&#39;-the-wisps are ordered to be&#10;there to hold a torch dance, as it is called. The silver and gold&#10;which is plentiful in the hill will be polished and placed out in&#10;the moonlight.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Who can the strangers be?&#34; asked the lizards; &#34;what can&#10;the matter be? Hark, what a buzzing and humming there&#10;is!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Just at this moment the elfin hill opened, and an old&#10;elfin maiden, hollow behind, came tripping out; she was the old elf&#10;king&#39;s housekeeper, and a distant relative of the family; therefore&#10;she wore an amber heart on the middle of her forehead. Her feet&#10;moved very fast, &#34;trip, trip;&#34; good gracious, how she could trip&#10;right down to the sea to the night-raven.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You are invited to the elf hill for this evening,&#34; said&#10;she; &#34;but will you do me a great favor and undertake the&#10;invitations? you ought to do something, for you have no&#10;housekeeping to attend to as I have. We are going to have some very&#10;grand people, conjurors, who have always something to say; and&#10;therefore the old elf king wishes to make a great&#10;display.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Who is to be invited?&#34; asked the raven.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;All the world may come to the great ball, even human&#10;beings, if they can only talk in their sleep, or do something after&#10;our fashion. But for the feast the company must be carefully&#10;selected; we can only admit persons of high rank; I have had a&#10;dispute myself with the elf king, as he thought we could not admit&#10;ghosts. The merman and his daughter must be invited first, although&#10;it may not be agreeable to them to remain so long on dry land, but&#10;they shall have a wet stone to sit on, or perhaps something better;&#10;so I think they will not refuse this time. We must have all the old&#10;demons of the first class, with tails, and the hobgoblins and imps;&#10;and then I think we ought not to leave out the death-horse, or the&#10;grave-pig, or even the church dwarf, although they do belong to the&#10;clergy, and are not reckoned among our people; but that is merely&#10;their office, they are nearly related to us, and visit us very&#10;frequently.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Croak,&#34; said the night-raven as he flew away with the&#10;invitations.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The elfin maidens we&#39;re already dancing on the elf hill,&#10;and they danced in shawls woven from moonshine and mist, which look&#10;very pretty to those who like such things. The large hall within&#10;the elf hill was splendidly decorated; the floor had been washed&#10;with moonshine, and the walls had been rubbed with magic ointment,&#10;so that they glowed like tulip-leaves in the light. In the kitchen&#10;were frogs roasting on the spit, and dishes preparing of snail&#10;skins, with children&#39;s fingers in them, salad of mushroom seed,&#10;hemlock, noses and marrow of mice, beer from the marsh woman&#39;s&#10;brewery, and sparkling salt-petre wine from the grave cellars.&#10;These were all substantial food. Rusty nails and church-window&#10;glass formed the dessert. The old elf king had his gold crown&#10;polished up with powdered slate-pencil; it was like that used by&#10;the first form, and very difficult for an elf king to obtain. In&#10;the bedrooms, curtains were hung up and fastened with the slime of&#10;snails; there was, indeed, a buzzing and humming&#10;everywhere.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Now we must fumigate the place with burnt horse-hair and&#10;pig&#39;s bristles, and then I think I shall have done my part,&#34; said&#10;the elf man-servant.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Father, dear,&#34; said the youngest daughter, &#34;may I now&#10;hear who our high-born visitors are?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Well, I suppose I must tell you now,&#34; he replied; &#34;two of&#10;my daughters must prepare themselves to be married, for the&#10;marriages certainly will take place. The old goblin from Norway,&#10;who lives in the ancient Dovre mountains, and who possesses many&#10;castles built of rock and freestone, besides a gold mine, which is&#10;better than all, so it is thought, is coming with his two sons, who&#10;are both seeking a wife. The old goblin is a true-hearted, honest,&#10;old Norwegian graybeard; cheerful and straightforward. I knew him&#10;formerly, when we used to drink together to our good fellowship: he&#10;came here once to fetch his wife, she is dead now. She was the&#10;daughter of the king of the chalk-hills at Moen. They say he took&#10;his wife from chalk; I shall be delighted to see him again. It is&#10;said that the boys are ill-bred, forward lads, but perhaps that is&#10;not quite correct, and they will become better as they grow older.&#10;Let me see that you know how to teach them good&#10;manners.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And when are they coming?&#34; asked the daughter.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That depends upon wind and weather,&#34; said the elf king;&#10;&#34;they travel economically. They will come when there is the chance&#10;of a ship. I wanted them to come over to Sweden, but the old man&#10;was not inclined to take my advice. He does not go forward with the&#10;times, and that I do not like.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Two will-o&#39;-the-wisps came jumping in, one quicker than&#10;the other, so of course, one arrived first. &#34;They are coming! they&#10;are coming!&#34; he cried.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Give me my crown,&#34; said the elf king, &#34;and let me stand&#10;in the moonshine.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The daughters drew on their shawls and bowed down to the&#10;ground. There stood the old goblin from the Dovre mountains, with&#10;his crown of hardened ice and polished fir-cones. Besides this, he&#10;wore a bear-skin, and great, warm boots, while his sons went with&#10;their throats bare and wore no braces, for they were strong&#10;men.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Is that a hill?&#34; said the youngest of the boys, pointing&#10;to the elf hill, &#34;we should call it a hole in Norway.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Boys,&#34; said the old man, &#34;a hole goes in, and a hill&#10;stands out; have you no eyes in your heads?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Another thing they wondered at was, that they were able&#10;without trouble to understand the language.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Take care,&#34; said the old man, &#34;or people will think you&#10;have not been well brought up.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then they entered the elfin hill, where the select and&#10;grand company were assembled, and so quickly had they appeared that&#10;they seemed to have been blown together. But for each guest the&#10;neatest and pleasantest arrangement had been made. The sea folks&#10;sat at table in great water-tubs, and they said it was just like&#10;being at home. All behaved themselves properly excepting the two&#10;young northern goblins; they put their legs on the table and&#10;thought they were all right.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Feet off the table-cloth!&#34; said the old goblin. They&#10;obeyed, but not immediately. Then they tickled the ladies who&#10;waited at table, with the fir-cones, which they carried in their&#10;pockets. They took off their boots, that they might be more at&#10;ease, and gave them to the ladies to hold. But their father, the&#10;old goblin, was very different; he talked pleasantly about the&#10;stately Norwegian rocks, and told fine tales of the waterfalls&#10;which dashed over them with a clattering noise like thunder or the&#10;sound of an organ, spreading their white foam on every side. He&#10;told of the salmon that leaps in the rushing waters, while the&#10;water-god plays on his golden harp. He spoke of the bright winter&#10;nights, when the sledge bells are ringing, and the boys run with&#10;burning torches across the smooth ice, which is so transparent that&#10;they can see the fishes dart forward beneath their feet. He&#10;described everything so clearly, that those who listened could see&#10;it all; they could see the saw-mills going, the men-servants and&#10;the maidens singing songs, and dancing a rattling dance,&#8212;when all&#10;at once the old goblin gave the old elfin maiden a kiss, such a&#10;tremendous kiss, and yet they were almost strangers to each&#10;other.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the elfin girls had to dance, first in the usual way,&#10;and then with stamping feet, which they performed very well; then&#10;followed the artistic and solo dance. Dear me, how they did throw&#10;their legs about! No one could tell where the dance begun, or where&#10;it ended, nor indeed which were legs and which were arms, for they&#10;were all flying about together, like the shavings in a saw-pit! And&#10;then they spun round so quickly that the death-horse and the&#10;grave-pig became sick and giddy, and were obliged to leave the&#10;table.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Stop!&#34; cried the old goblin,&#34; is that the only&#10;house-keeping they can perform? Can they do anything more than&#10;dance and throw about their legs, and make a whirlwind?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You shall soon see what they can do,&#34; said the elf king.&#10;And then he called his youngest daughter to him. She was slender&#10;and fair as moonlight, and the most graceful of all the sisters.&#10;She took a white chip in her mouth, and vanished instantly; this&#10;was her accomplishment. But the old goblin said he should not like&#10;his wife to have such an accomplishment, and thought his boys would&#10;have the same objection. Another daughter could make a figure like&#10;herself follow her, as if she had a shadow, which none of the&#10;goblin folk ever had. The third was of quite a different sort; she&#10;had learnt in the brew-house of the moor witch how to lard elfin&#10;puddings with glow-worms.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;She will make a good housewife,&#34; said the old goblin, and&#10;then saluted her with his eyes instead of drinking her health; for&#10;he did not drink much.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Now came the fourth daughter, with a large harp to play&#10;upon; and when she struck the first chord, every one lifted up the&#10;left leg (for the goblins are left-legged), and at the second chord&#10;they found they must all do just what she wanted.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That is a dangerous woman,&#34; said the old goblin; and the&#10;two sons walked out of the hill; they had had enough of it. &#34;And&#10;what can the next daughter do?&#34; asked the old goblin.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I have learnt everything that is Norwegian,&#34; said she;&#10;&#34;and I will never marry, unless I can go to Norway.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then her youngest sister whispered to the old goblin,&#10;&#34;That is only because she has heard, in a Norwegian song, that when&#10;the world shall decay, the cliffs of Norway will remain standing&#10;like monuments; and she wants to get there, that she may be safe;&#10;for she is so afraid of sinking.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ho! ho!&#34; said the old goblin, &#34;is that what she means?&#10;Well, what can the seventh and last do?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The sixth comes before the seventh,&#34; said the elf king,&#10;for he could reckon; but the sixth would not come&#10;forward.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I can only tell people the truth,&#34; said she. &#34;No one&#10;cares for me, nor troubles himself about me; and I have enough to&#10;do to sew my grave clothes.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;So the seventh and last came; and what could she do? Why,&#10;she could tell stories, as many as you liked, on any&#10;subject.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Here are my five fingers,&#34; said the old goblin; &#34;now tell&#10;me a story for each of them.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;So she took him by the wrist, and he laughed till he&#10;nearly choked; and when she came to the fourth finger, there was a&#10;gold ring on it, as if it knew there was to be a betrothal. Then&#10;the old goblin said, &#34;Hold fast what you have: this hand is yours;&#10;for I will have you for a wife myself.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the elfin girl said that the stories about the&#10;ring-finger and little Peter Playman had not yet been&#10;told.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;We will hear them in the winter,&#34; said the old goblin,&#10;&#34;and also about the fir and the birch-trees, and the ghost stories,&#10;and of the tingling frost. You shall tell your tales, for no one&#10;over there can do it so well; and we will sit in the stone rooms,&#10;where the pine logs are burning, and drink mead out of the golden&#10;drinking-horn of the old Norwegian kings. The water-god has given&#10;me two; and when we sit there, Nix comes to pay us a visit, and&#10;will sing you all the songs of the mountain shepherdesses. How&#10;merry we shall be! The salmon will be leaping in the waterfalls,&#10;and dashing against the stone walls, but he will not be able to&#10;come in. It is indeed very pleasant to live in old Norway. But&#10;where are the lads?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Where indeed were they? Why, running about the fields, and&#10;blowing out the will-o&#39;-the-wisps, who so good-naturedly came and&#10;brought their torches.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What tricks have you been playing?&#34; said the old goblin.&#10;&#34;I have taken a mother for you, and now you may take one of your&#10;aunts.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But the youngsters said they would rather make a speech&#10;and drink to their good fellowship; they had no wish to marry. Then&#10;they made speeches and drank toasts, and tipped their glasses, to&#10;show that they were empty. Then they took off their coats, and lay&#10;down on the table to sleep; for they made themselves quite at home.&#10;But the old goblin danced about the room with his young bride, and&#10;exchanged boots with her, which is more fashionable than exchanging&#10;rings.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The cock is crowing,&#34; said the old elfin maiden who acted&#10;as housekeeper; now we must close the shutters, that the sun may&#10;not scorch us.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the hill closed up. But the lizards continued to run&#10;up and down the riven tree; and one said to the other, &#34;Oh, how&#10;much I was pleased with the old goblin!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The boys pleased me better,&#34; said the earth-worm. But&#10;then the poor miserable creature could not see.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode(''), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;MANY, many years ago lived an emperor, who thought so much&#10;of new clothes that he spent all his money in order to obtain them;&#10;his only ambition was to be always well dressed. He did not care&#10;for his soldiers, and the theatre did not amuse him; the only&#10;thing, in fact, he thought anything of was to drive out and show a&#10;new suit of clothes. He had a coat for every hour of the day; and&#10;as one would say of a king &#34;He is in his cabinet,&#34; so one could say&#10;of him, &#34;The emperor is in his dressing-room.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The great city where he resided was very gay; every day&#10;many strangers from all parts of the globe arrived. One day two&#10;swindlers came to this city; they made people believe that they&#10;were weavers, and declared they could manufacture the finest cloth&#10;to be imagined. Their colours and patterns, they said, were not&#10;only exceptionally beautiful, but the clothes made of their&#10;material possessed the wonderful quality of being invisible to any&#10;man who was unfit for his office or unpardonably stupid.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That must be wonderful cloth,&#34; thought the emperor. &#34;If I&#10;were to be dressed in a suit made of this cloth I should be able to&#10;find out which men in my empire were unfit for their places, and I&#10;could distinguish the clever from the stupid. I must have this&#10;cloth woven for me without delay.&#34; And he gave a large sum of money&#10;to the swindlers, in advance, that they should set to work without&#10;any loss of time. They set up two looms, and pretended to be very&#10;hard at work, but they did nothing whatever on the looms. They&#10;asked for the finest silk and the most precious gold-cloth; all&#10;they got they did away with, and worked at the empty looms till&#10;late at night.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I should very much like to know how they are getting on&#10;with the cloth,&#34; thought the emperor. But he felt rather uneasy&#10;when he remembered that he who was not fit for his office could not&#10;see it. Personally, he was of opinion that he had nothing to fear,&#10;yet he thought it advisable to send somebody else first to see how&#10;matters stood. Everybody in the town knew what a remarkable quality&#10;the stuff possessed, and all were anxious to see how bad or stupid&#10;their neighbours were.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I shall send my honest old minister to the weavers,&#34;&#10;thought the emperor. &#34;He can judge best how the stuff looks, for he&#10;is intelligent, and nobody understands his office better than&#10;he.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The good old minister went into the room where the&#10;swindlers sat before the empty looms. &#34;Heaven preserve us!&#34; he&#10;thought, and opened his eyes wide, &#34;I cannot see anything at all,&#34;&#10;but he did not say so. Both swindlers requested him to come near,&#10;and asked him if he did not admire the exquisite pattern and the&#10;beautiful colours, pointing to the empty looms. The poor old&#10;minister tried his very best, but he could see nothing, for there&#10;was nothing to be seen. &#34;Oh dear,&#34; he thought, &#34;can I be so stupid?&#10;I should never have thought so, and nobody must know it! Is it&#10;possible that I am not fit for my office? No, no, I cannot say that&#10;I was unable to see the cloth.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Now, have you got nothing to say?&#34; said one of the&#10;swindlers, while he pretended to be busily weaving.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, it is very pretty, exceedingly beautiful,&#34; replied&#10;the old minister looking through his glasses. &#34;What a beautiful&#10;pattern, what brilliant colours! I shall tell the emperor that I&#10;like the cloth very much.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;We are pleased to hear that,&#34; said the two weavers, and&#10;described to him the colours and explained the curious pattern. The&#10;old minister listened attentively, that he might relate to the&#10;emperor what they said; and so he did.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Now the swindlers asked for more money, silk and&#10;gold-cloth, which they required for weaving. They kept everything&#10;for themselves, and not a thread came near the loom, but they&#10;continued, as hitherto, to work at the empty looms.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Soon afterwards the emperor sent another honest courtier&#10;to the weavers to see how they were getting on, and if the cloth&#10;was nearly finished. Like the old minister, he looked and looked&#10;but could see nothing, as there was nothing to be seen.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Is it not a beautiful piece of cloth?&#34; asked the two&#10;swindlers, showing and explaining the magnificent pattern, which,&#10;however, did not exist.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I am not stupid,&#34; said the man. &#34;It is therefore my good&#10;appointment for which I am not fit. It is very strange, but I must&#10;not let any one know it;&#34; and he praised the cloth, which he did&#10;not see, and expressed his joy at the beautiful colours and the&#10;fine pattern. &#34;It is very excellent,&#34; he said to the&#10;emperor.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Everybody in the whole town talked about the precious&#10;cloth. At last the emperor wished to see it himself, while it was&#10;still on the loom. With a number of courtiers, including the two&#10;who had already been there, he went to the two clever swindlers,&#10;who now worked as hard as they could, but without using any&#10;thread.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Is it not magnificent?&#34; said the two old statesmen who&#10;had been there before. &#34;Your Majesty must admire the colours and&#10;the pattern.&#34; And then they pointed to the empty looms, for they&#10;imagined the others could see the cloth.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What is this?&#34; thought the emperor, &#34;I do not see&#10;anything at all. That is terrible! Am I stupid? Am I unfit to be&#10;emperor? That would indeed be the most dreadful thing that could&#10;happen to me.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Really,&#34; he said, turning to the weavers, &#34;your cloth has&#10;our most gracious approval;&#34; and nodding contentedly he looked at&#10;the empty loom, for he did not like to say that he saw nothing. All&#10;his attendants, who were with him, looked and looked, and although&#10;they could not see anything more than the others, they said, like&#10;the emperor, &#34;It is very beautiful.&#34; And all advised him to wear&#10;the new magnificent clothes at a great procession which was soon to&#10;take place. &#34;It is magnificent, beautiful, excellent,&#34; one heard&#10;them say; everybody seemed to be delighted, and the emperor&#10;appointed the two swindlers &#34;Imperial Court weavers.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The whole night previous to the day on which the&#10;procession was to take place, the swindlers pretended to work, and&#10;burned more than sixteen candles. People should see that they were&#10;busy to finish the emperor&#39;s new suit. They pretended to take the&#10;cloth from the loom, and worked about in the air with big scissors,&#10;and sewed with needles without thread, and said at last: &#34;The&#10;emperor&#39;s new suit is ready now.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The emperor and all his barons then came to the hall; the&#10;swindlers held their arms up as if they held something in their&#10;hands and said: &#34;These are the trousers!&#34; &#34;This is the coat!&#34; and&#10;&#34;Here is the cloak!&#34; and so on. &#34;They are all as light as a cobweb,&#10;and one must feel as if one had nothing at all upon the body; but&#10;that is just the beauty of them.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Indeed!&#34; said all the courtiers; but they could not see&#10;anything, for there was nothing to be seen.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Does it please your Majesty now to graciously undress,&#34;&#10;said the swindlers, &#34;that we may assist your Majesty in putting on&#10;the new suit before the large looking-glass?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The emperor undressed, and the swindlers pretended to put&#10;the new suit upon him, one piece after another; and the emperor&#10;looked at himself in the glass from every side.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;How well they look! How well they fit!&#34; said all. &#34;What a&#10;beautiful pattern! What fine colours! That is a magnificent suit of&#10;clothes!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The master of the ceremonies announced that the bearers of&#10;the canopy, which was to be carried in the procession, were&#10;ready.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I am ready,&#34; said the emperor. &#34;Does not my suit fit me&#10;marvellously?&#34; Then he turned once more to the looking-glass, that&#10;people should think he admired his garments.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The chamberlains, who were to carry the train, stretched&#10;their hands to the ground as if they lifted up a train, and&#10;pretended to hold something in their hands; they did not like&#10;people to know that they could not see anything.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The emperor marched in the procession under the beautiful&#10;canopy, and all who saw him in the street and out of the windows&#10;exclaimed: &#34;Indeed, the emperor&#39;s new suit is incomparable! What a&#10;long train he has! How well it fits him!&#34; Nobody wished to let&#10;others know he saw nothing, for then he would have been unfit for&#10;his office or too stupid. Never emperor&#39;s clothes were more&#10;admired.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But he has nothing on at all,&#34; said a little child at&#10;last. &#34;Good heavens! listen to the voice of an innocent child,&#34;&#10;said the father, and one whispered to the other what the child had&#10;said. &#34;But he has nothing on at all,&#34; cried at last the whole&#10;people. That made a deep impression upon the emperor, for it seemed&#10;to him that they were right; but he thought to himself, &#34;Now I must&#10;bear up to the end.&#34; And the chamberlains walked with still greater&#10;dignity, as if they carried the train which did not exist.&#10;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode(''), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;FAR down in the forest, where the warm sun and the fresh&#10;air made a sweet resting-place, grew a pretty little fir-tree; and&#10;yet it was not happy, it wished so much to be tall like its&#10;companions&#8212;the pines and firs which grew around it. The sun shone,&#10;and the soft air fluttered its leaves, and the little peasant&#10;children passed by, prattling merrily, but the fir-tree heeded them&#10;not. Sometimes the children would bring a large basket of&#10;raspberries or strawberries, wreathed on a straw, and seat&#10;themselves near the fir-tree, and say, &#34;Is it not a pretty little&#10;tree?&#34; which made it feel more unhappy than before. And yet all&#10;this while the tree grew a notch or joint taller every year; for by&#10;the number of joints in the stem of a fir-tree we can discover its&#10;age. Still, as it grew, it complained, &#34;Oh! how I wish I were as&#10;tall as the other trees, then I would spread out my branches on&#10;every side, and my top would over-look the wide world. I should&#10;have the birds building their nests on my boughs, and when the wind&#10;blew, I should bow with stately dignity like my tall companions.&#34;&#10;The tree was so discontented, that it took no pleasure in the warm&#10;sunshine, the birds, or the rosy clouds that floated over it&#10;morning and evening. Sometimes, in winter, when the snow lay white&#10;and glittering on the ground, a hare would come springing along,&#10;and jump right over the little tree; and then how mortified it&#10;would feel! Two winters passed, and when the third arrived, the&#10;tree had grown so tall that the hare was obliged to run round it.&#10;Yet it remained unsatisfied, and would exclaim, &#34;Oh, if I could but&#10;keep on growing tall and old! There is nothing else worth caring&#10;for in the world!&#34; In the autumn, as usual, the wood-cutters came&#10;and cut down several of the tallest trees, and the young fir-tree,&#10;which was now grown to its full height, shuddered as the noble&#10;trees fell to the earth with a crash. After the branches were&#10;lopped off, the trunks looked so slender and bare, that they could&#10;scarcely be recognized. Then they were placed upon wagons, and&#10;drawn by horses out of the forest. &#34;Where were they going? What&#10;would become of them?&#34; The young fir-tree wished very much to know;&#10;so in the spring, when the swallows and the storks came, it asked,&#10;&#34;Do you know where those trees were taken? Did you meet&#10;them?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The swallows knew nothing, but the stork, after a little&#10;reflection, nodded his head, and said, &#34;Yes, I think I do. I met&#10;several new ships when I flew from Egypt, and they had fine masts&#10;that smelt like fir. I think these must have been the trees; I&#10;assure you they were stately, very stately.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, how I wish I were tall enough to go on the sea,&#34; said&#10;the fir-tree. &#34;What is the sea, and what does it look&#10;like?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It would take too much time to explain,&#34; said the stork,&#10;flying quickly away.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Rejoice in thy youth,&#34; said the sunbeam; &#34;rejoice in thy&#10;fresh growth, and the young life that is in thee.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the wind kissed the tree, and the dew watered it with&#10;tears; but the fir-tree regarded them not.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Christmas-time drew near, and many young trees were cut&#10;down, some even smaller and younger than the fir-tree who enjoyed&#10;neither rest nor peace with longing to leave its forest home. These&#10;young trees, which were chosen for their beauty, kept their&#10;branches, and were also laid on wagons and drawn by horses out of&#10;the forest.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Where are they going?&#34; asked the fir-tree. &#34;They are not&#10;taller than I am: indeed, one is much less; and why are the&#10;branches not cut off? Where are they going?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;We know, we know,&#34; sang the sparrows; &#34;we have looked in&#10;at the windows of the houses in the town, and we know what is done&#10;with them. They are dressed up in the most splendid manner. We have&#10;seen them standing in the middle of a warm room, and adorned with&#10;all sorts of beautiful things,&#8212;honey cakes, gilded apples,&#10;playthings, and many hundreds of wax tapers.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And then,&#34; asked the fir-tree, trembling through all its&#10;branches, &#34;and then what happens?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;We did not see any more,&#34; said the sparrows; &#34;but this&#10;was enough for us.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I wonder whether anything so brilliant will ever happen&#10;to me,&#34; thought the fir-tree. &#34;It would be much better than&#10;crossing the sea. I long for it almost with pain. Oh! when will&#10;Christmas be here? I am now as tall and well grown as those which&#10;were taken away last year. Oh! that I were now laid on the wagon,&#10;or standing in the warm room, with all that brightness and splendor&#10;around me! Something better and more beautiful is to come after, or&#10;the trees would not be so decked out. Yes, what follows will be&#10;grander and more splendid. What can it be? I am weary with longing.&#10;I scarcely know how I feel.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Rejoice with us,&#34; said the air and the sunlight. &#34;Enjoy&#10;thine own bright life in the fresh air.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But the tree would not rejoice, though it grew taller&#10;every day; and, winter and summer, its dark-green foliage might be&#10;seen in the forest, while passers by would say, &#34;What a beautiful&#10;tree!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A short time before Christmas, the discontented fir-tree&#10;was the first to fall. As the axe cut through the stem, and divided&#10;the pith, the tree fell with a groan to the earth, conscious of&#10;pain and faintness, and forgetting all its anticipations of&#10;happiness, in sorrow at leaving its home in the forest. It knew&#10;that it should never again see its dear old companions, the trees,&#10;nor the little bushes and many-colored flowers that had grown by&#10;its side; perhaps not even the birds. Neither was the journey at&#10;all pleasant. The tree first recovered itself while being unpacked&#10;in the courtyard of a house, with several other trees; and it heard&#10;a man say, &#34;We only want one, and this is the&#10;prettiest.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then came two servants in grand livery, and carried the&#10;fir-tree into a large and beautiful apartment. On the walls hung&#10;pictures, and near the great stove stood great china vases, with&#10;lions on the lids. There were rocking chairs, silken sofas, large&#10;tables, covered with pictures, books, and playthings, worth a great&#10;deal of money,&#8212;at least, the children said so. Then the fir-tree&#10;was placed in a large tub, full of sand; but green baize hung all&#10;around it, so that no one could see it was a tub, and it stood on a&#10;very handsome carpet. How the fir-tree trembled! &#34;What was going to&#10;happen to him now?&#34; Some young ladies came, and the servants helped&#10;them to adorn the tree. On one branch they hung little bags cut out&#10;of colored paper, and each bag was filled with sweetmeats; from&#10;other branches hung gilded apples and walnuts, as if they had grown&#10;there; and above, and all round, were hundreds of red, blue, and&#10;white tapers, which were fastened on the branches. Dolls, exactly&#10;like real babies, were placed under the green leaves,&#8212;the tree had&#10;never seen such things before,&#8212;and at the very top was fastened a&#10;glittering star, made of tinsel. Oh, it was very&#10;beautiful!&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;This evening,&#34; they all exclaimed, &#34;how bright it will&#10;be!&#34; &#34;Oh, that the evening were come,&#34; thought the tree, &#34;and the&#10;tapers lighted! then I shall know what else is going to happen.&#10;Will the trees of the forest come to see me? I wonder if the&#10;sparrows will peep in at the windows as they fly? shall I grow&#10;faster here, and keep on all these ornaments summer and winter?&#34;&#10;But guessing was of very little use; it made his bark ache, and&#10;this pain is as bad for a slender fir-tree, as headache is for us.&#10;At last the tapers were lighted, and then what a glistening blaze&#10;of light the tree presented! It trembled so with joy in all its&#10;branches, that one of the candles fell among the green leaves and&#10;burnt some of them. &#34;Help! help!&#34; exclaimed the young ladies, but&#10;there was no danger, for they quickly extinguished the fire. After&#10;this, the tree tried not to tremble at all, though the fire&#10;frightened him; he was so anxious not to hurt any of the beautiful&#10;ornaments, even while their brilliancy dazzled him. And now the&#10;folding doors were thrown open, and a troop of children rushed in&#10;as if they intended to upset the tree; they were followed more&#10;silently by their elders. For a moment the little ones stood silent&#10;with astonishment, and then they shouted for joy, till the room&#10;rang, and they danced merrily round the tree, while one present&#10;after another was taken from it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What are they doing? What will happen next?&#34; thought the&#10;fir. At last the candles burnt down to the branches and were put&#10;out. Then the children received permission to plunder the&#10;tree.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Oh, how they rushed upon it, till the branches cracked,&#10;and had it not been fastened with the glistening star to the&#10;ceiling, it must have been thrown down. The children then danced&#10;about with their pretty toys, and no one noticed the tree, except&#10;the children&#39;s maid who came and peeped among the branches to see&#10;if an apple or a fig had been forgotten.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;A story, a story,&#34; cried the children, pulling a little&#10;fat man towards the tree.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Now we shall be in the green shade,&#34; said the man, as he&#10;seated himself under it, &#34;and the tree will have the pleasure of&#10;hearing also, but I shall only relate one story; what shall it be?&#10;Ivede-Avede, or Humpty Dumpty, who fell down stairs, but soon got&#10;up again, and at last married a princess.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ivede-Avede,&#34; cried some. &#34;Humpty Dumpty,&#34; cried others,&#10;and there was a fine shouting and crying out. But the fir-tree&#10;remained quite still, and thought to himself, &#34;Shall I have&#10;anything to do with all this?&#34; but he had already amused them as&#10;much as they wished. Then the old man told them the story of Humpty&#10;Dumpty, how he fell down stairs, and was raised up again, and&#10;married a princess. And the children clapped their hands and cried,&#10;&#34;Tell another, tell another,&#34; for they wanted to hear the story of&#10;&#34;Ivede-Avede;&#34; but they only had &#34;Humpty Dumpty.&#34; After this the&#10;fir-tree became quite silent and thoughtful; never had the birds in&#10;the forest told such tales as &#34;Humpty Dumpty,&#34; who fell down&#10;stairs, and yet married a princess.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ah! yes, so it happens in the world,&#34; thought the&#10;fir-tree; he believed it all, because it was related by such a nice&#10;man. &#34;Ah! well,&#34; he thought, &#34;who knows? perhaps I may fall down&#10;too, and marry a princess;&#34; and he looked forward joyfully to the&#10;next evening, expecting to be again decked out with lights and&#10;playthings, gold and fruit. &#34;To-morrow I will not tremble,&#34; thought&#10;he; &#34;I will enjoy all my splendor, and I shall hear the story of&#10;Humpty Dumpty again, and perhaps Ivede-Avede.&#34; And the tree&#10;remained quiet and thoughtful all night. In the morning the&#10;servants and the housemaid came in. &#34;Now,&#34; thought the fir, &#34;all my&#10;splendor is going to begin again.&#34; But they dragged him out of the&#10;room and up stairs to the garret, and threw him on the floor, in a&#10;dark corner, where no daylight shone, and there they left him.&#10;&#34;What does this mean?&#34; thought the tree, &#34;what am I to do here? I&#10;can hear nothing in a place like this,&#34; and he had time enough to&#10;think, for days and nights passed and no one came near him, and&#10;when at last somebody did come, it was only to put away large boxes&#10;in a corner. So the tree was completely hidden from sight as if it&#10;had never existed. &#34;It is winter now,&#34; thought the tree, &#34;the&#10;ground is hard and covered with snow, so that people cannot plant&#10;me. I shall be sheltered here, I dare say, until spring comes. How&#10;thoughtful and kind everybody is to me! Still I wish this place&#10;were not so dark, as well as lonely, with not even a little hare to&#10;look at. How pleasant it was out in the forest while the snow lay&#10;on the ground, when the hare would run by, yes, and jump over me&#10;too, although I did not like it then. Oh! it is terrible lonely&#10;here.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Squeak, squeak,&#34; said a little mouse, creeping cautiously&#10;towards the tree; then came another; and they both sniffed at the&#10;fir-tree and crept between the branches.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, it is very cold,&#34; said the little mouse, &#34;or else we&#10;should be so comfortable here, shouldn&#39;t we, you old&#10;fir-tree?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I am not old,&#34; said the fir-tree, &#34;there are many who are&#10;older than I am.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Where do you come from? and what do you know?&#34; asked the&#10;mice, who were full of curiosity. &#34;Have you seen the most beautiful&#10;places in the world, and can you tell us all about them? and have&#10;you been in the storeroom, where cheeses lie on the shelf, and hams&#10;hang from the ceiling? One can run about on tallow candles there,&#10;and go in thin and come out fat.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I know nothing of that place,&#34; said the fir-tree, &#34;but I&#10;know the wood where the sun shines and the birds sing.&#34; And then&#10;the tree told the little mice all about its youth. They had never&#10;heard such an account in their lives; and after they had listened&#10;to it attentively, they said, &#34;What a number of things you have&#10;seen? you must have been very happy.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Happy!&#34; exclaimed the fir-tree, and then as he reflected&#10;upon what he had been telling them, he said, &#34;Ah, yes! after all&#10;those were happy days.&#34; But when he went on and related all about&#10;Christmas-eve, and how he had been dressed up with cakes and&#10;lights, the mice said, &#34;How happy you must have been, you old&#10;fir-tree.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I am not old at all,&#34; replied the tree, &#34;I only came from&#10;the forest this winter, I am now checked in my growth.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What splendid stories you can relate,&#34; said the little&#10;mice. And the next night four other mice came with them to hear&#10;what the tree had to tell. The more he talked the more he&#10;remembered, and then he thought to himself, &#34;Those were happy days,&#10;but they may come again. Humpty Dumpty fell down stairs, and yet he&#10;married the princess; perhaps I may marry a princess too.&#34; And the&#10;fir-tree thought of the pretty little birch-tree that grew in the&#10;forest, which was to him a real beautiful princess.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Who is Humpty Dumpty?&#34; asked the little mice. And then&#10;the tree related the whole story; he could remember every single&#10;word, and the little mice was so delighted with it, that they were&#10;ready to jump to the top of the tree. The next night a great many&#10;more mice made their appearance, and on Sunday two rats came with&#10;them; but they said, it was not a pretty story at all, and the&#10;little mice were very sorry, for it made them also think less of&#10;it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Do you know only one story?&#34; asked the rats.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Only one,&#34; replied the fir-tree; &#34;I heard it on the&#10;happiest evening of my life; but I did not know I was so happy at&#10;the time.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;We think it is a very miserable story,&#34; said the rats.&#10;&#34;Don&#39;t you know any story about bacon, or tallow in the&#10;storeroom.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No,&#34; replied the tree.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Many thanks to you then,&#34; replied the rats, and they&#10;marched off.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The little mice also kept away after this, and the tree&#10;sighed, and said, &#34;It was very pleasant when the merry little mice&#10;sat round me and listened while I talked. Now that is all passed&#10;too. However, I shall consider myself happy when some one comes to&#10;take me out of this place.&#34; But would this ever happen? Yes; one&#10;morning people came to clear out the garret, the boxes were packed&#10;away, and the tree was pulled out of the corner, and thrown roughly&#10;on the garret floor; then the servant dragged it out upon the&#10;staircase where the daylight shone. &#34;Now life is beginning again,&#34;&#10;said the tree, rejoicing in the sunshine and fresh air. Then it was&#10;carried down stairs and taken into the courtyard so quickly, that&#10;it forgot to think of itself, and could only look about, there was&#10;so much to be seen. The court was close to a garden, where&#10;everything looked blooming. Fresh and fragrant roses hung over the&#10;little palings. The linden-trees were in blossom; while the&#10;swallows flew here and there, crying, &#34;Twit, twit, twit, my mate is&#10;coming,&#34;&#8212;but it was not the fir-tree they meant. &#34;Now I shall&#10;live,&#34; cried the tree, joyfully spreading out its branches; but&#10;alas! they were all withered and yellow, and it lay in a corner&#10;amongst weeds and nettles. The star of gold paper still stuck in&#10;the top of the tree and glittered in the sunshine. In the same&#10;courtyard two of the merry children were playing who had danced&#10;round the tree at Christmas, and had been so happy. The youngest&#10;saw the gilded star, and ran and pulled it off the tree. &#34;Look what&#10;is sticking to the ugly old fir-tree,&#34; said the child, treading on&#10;the branches till they crackled under his boots. And the tree saw&#10;all the fresh bright flowers in the garden, and then looked at&#10;itself, and wished it had remained in the dark corner of the&#10;garret. It thought of its fresh youth in the forest, of the merry&#10;Christmas evening, and of the little mice who had listened to the&#10;story of &#34;Humpty Dumpty.&#34; &#34;Past! past!&#34; said the old tree; &#34;Oh, had&#10;I but enjoyed myself while I could have done so! but now it is too&#10;late.&#34; Then a lad came and chopped the tree into small pieces, till&#10;a large bundle lay in a heap on the ground. The pieces were placed&#10;in a fire under the copper, and they quickly blazed up brightly,&#10;while the tree sighed so deeply that each sigh was like a&#10;pistol-shot. Then the children, who were at play, came and seated&#10;themselves in front of the fire, and looked at it and cried, &#34;Pop,&#10;pop.&#34; But at each &#34;pop,&#34; which was a deep sigh, the tree was&#10;thinking of a summer day in the forest; and of Christmas evening,&#10;and of &#34;Humpty Dumpty,&#34; the only story it had ever heard or knew&#10;how to relate, till at last it was consumed. The boys still played&#10;in the garden, and the youngest wore the golden star on his breast,&#10;with which the tree had been adorned during the happiest evening of&#10;its existence. Now all was past; the tree&#39;s life was past, and the&#10;story also,&#8212;for all stories must come to an end at last.&#10;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode(''), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;THE flax was in full bloom; it had pretty little blue&#10;flowers as delicate as the wings of a moth, or even more so. The&#10;sun shone, and the showers watered it; and this was just as good&#10;for the flax as it is for little children to be washed and then&#10;kissed by their mother. They look much prettier for it, and so did&#10;the flax.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;People say that I look exceedingly well,&#34; said the flax,&#10;&#34;and that I am so fine and long that I shall make a beautiful piece&#10;of linen. How fortunate I am; it makes me so happy, it is such a&#10;pleasant thing to know that something can be made of me. How the&#10;sunshine cheers me, and how sweet and refreshing is the rain; my&#10;happiness overpowers me, no one in the world can feel happier than&#10;I am.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ah, yes, no doubt,&#34; said the fern, &#34;but you do not know&#10;the world yet as well as I do, for my sticks are knotty;&#34; and then&#10;it sung quite mournfully&#8212;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Snip, snap, snurre,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Basse lurre:&#60;br /&#62;&#10;The song is ended.&#34;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No, it is not ended,&#34; said the flax. &#34;To-morrow the sun&#10;will shine, or the rain descend. I feel that I am growing. I feel&#10;that I am in full blossom. I am the happiest of all&#10;creatures.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Well, one day some people came, who took hold of the flax,&#10;and pulled it up by the roots; this was painful; then it was laid&#10;in water as if they intended to drown it; and, after that, placed&#10;near a fire as if it were to be roasted; all this was very&#10;shocking. &#34;We cannot expect to be happy always,&#34; said the flax; &#34;by&#10;experiencing evil as well as good, we become wise.&#34; And certainly&#10;there was plenty of evil in store for the flax. It was steeped, and&#10;roasted, and broken, and combed; indeed, it scarcely knew what was&#10;done to it. At last it was put on the spinning wheel. &#34;Whirr,&#10;whirr,&#34; went the wheel so quickly that the flax could not collect&#10;its thoughts. &#34;Well, I have been very happy,&#34; he thought in the&#10;midst of his pain, &#34;and must be contented with the past;&#34; and&#10;contented he remained till he was put on the loom, and became a&#10;beautiful piece of white linen. All the flax, even to the last&#10;stalk, was used in making this one piece. &#34;Well, this is quite&#10;wonderful; I could not have believed that I should be so favored by&#10;fortune. The fern was not wrong with its song of&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#39;Snip, snap, snurre,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Basse lurre.&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But the song is not ended yet, I am sure; it is only just&#10;beginning. How wonderful it is, that after all I have suffered, I&#10;am made something of at last; I am the luckiest person in the&#10;world&#8212;so strong and fine; and how white, and what a length! This is&#10;something different to being a mere plant and bearing flowers. Then&#10;I had no attention, nor any water unless it rained; now, I am&#10;watched and taken care of. Every morning the maid turns me over,&#10;and I have a shower-bath from the watering-pot every evening. Yes,&#10;and the clergyman&#39;s wife noticed me, and said I was the best piece&#10;of linen in the whole parish. I cannot be happier than I am&#10;now.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;After some time, the linen was taken into the house,&#10;placed under the scissors, and cut and torn into pieces, and then&#10;pricked with needles. This certainly was not pleasant; but at last&#10;it was made into twelve garments of that kind which people do not&#10;like to name, and yet everybody should wear one. &#34;See, now, then,&#34;&#10;said the flax; &#34;I have become something of importance. This was my&#10;destiny; it is quite a blessing. Now I shall be of some use in the&#10;world, as everyone ought to be; it is the only way to be happy. I&#10;am now divided into twelve pieces, and yet we are all one and the&#10;same in the whole dozen. It is most extraordinary good&#10;fortune.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Years passed away, and at last the linen was so worn it&#10;could scarcely hold together. &#34;It must end very soon,&#34; said the&#10;pieces to each other; &#34;we would gladly have held together a little&#10;longer, but it is useless to expect impossibilities.&#34; And at length&#10;they fell into rags and tatters, and thought it was all over with&#10;them, for they were torn to shreds, and steeped in water, and made&#10;into a pulp, and dried, and they knew not what besides, till all at&#10;once they found themselves beautiful white paper. &#34;Well, now, this&#10;is a surprise; a glorious surprise too,&#34; said the paper. &#34;I am now&#10;finer than ever, and I shall be written upon, and who can tell what&#10;fine things I may have written upon me. This is wonderful luck!&#34;&#10;And sure enough the most beautiful stories and poetry were written&#10;upon it, and only once was there a blot, which was very fortunate.&#10;Then people heard the stories and poetry read, and it made them&#10;wiser and better; for all that was written had a good and sensible&#10;meaning, and a great blessing was contained in the words on this&#10;paper.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I never imagined anything like this,&#34; said the paper,&#10;&#34;when I was only a little blue flower, growing in the fields. How&#10;could I fancy that I should ever be the means of bringing knowledge&#10;and joy to man? I cannot understand it myself, and yet it is really&#10;so. Heaven knows that I have done nothing myself, but what I was&#10;obliged to do with my weak powers for my own preservation; and yet&#10;I have been promoted from one joy and honor to another. Each time I&#10;think that the song is ended; and then something higher and better&#10;begins for me. I suppose now I shall be sent on my travels about&#10;the world, so that people may read me. It cannot be otherwise;&#10;indeed, it is more than probable; for I have more splendid thoughts&#10;written upon me, than I had pretty flowers in olden times. I am&#10;happier than ever.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But the paper did not go on its travels; it was sent to&#10;the printer, and all the words written upon it were set up in type,&#10;to make a book, or rather, many hundreds of books; for so many more&#10;persons could derive pleasure and profit from a printed book, than&#10;from the written paper; and if the paper had been sent around the&#10;world, it would have been worn out before it had got half through&#10;its journey.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;This is certainly the wisest plan,&#34; said the written&#10;paper; &#34;I really did not think of that. I shall remain at home, and&#10;be held in honor, like some old grandfather, as I really am to all&#10;these new books. They will do some good. I could not have wandered&#10;about as they do. Yet he who wrote all this has looked at me, as&#10;every word flowed from his pen upon my surface. I am the most&#10;honored of all.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the paper was tied in a bundle with other papers, and&#10;thrown into a tub that stood in the washhouse.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;After work, it is well to rest,&#34; said the paper, &#34;and a&#10;very good opportunity to collect one&#39;s thoughts. Now I am able, for&#10;the first time, to think of my real condition; and to know one&#39;s&#10;self is true progress. What will be done with me now, I wonder? No&#10;doubt I shall still go forward. I have always progressed hitherto,&#10;as I know quite well.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Now it happened one day that all the paper in the tub was&#10;taken out, and laid on the hearth to be burnt. People said it could&#10;not be sold at the shop, to wrap up butter and sugar, because it&#10;had been written upon. The children in the house stood round the&#10;stove; for they wanted to see the paper burn, because it flamed up&#10;so prettily, and afterwards, among the ashes, so many red sparks&#10;could be seen running one after the other, here and there, as quick&#10;as the wind. They called it seeing the children come out of school,&#10;and the last spark was the schoolmaster. They often thought the&#10;last spark had come; and one would cry, &#34;There goes the&#10;schoolmaster;&#34; but the next moment another spark would appear,&#10;shining so beautifully. How they would like to know where the&#10;sparks all went to! Perhaps we shall find out some day, but we&#10;don&#39;t know now.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The whole bundle of paper had been placed on the fire, and&#10;was soon alight. &#34;Ugh,&#34; cried the paper, as it burst into a bright&#10;flame; &#34;ugh.&#34; It was certainly not very pleasant to be burning; but&#10;when the whole was wrapped in flames, the flames mounted up into&#10;the air, higher than the flax had ever been able to raise its&#10;little blue flower, and they glistened as the white linen never&#10;could have glistened. All the written letters became quite red in a&#10;moment, and all the words and thoughts turned to fire.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Now I am mounting straight up to the sun,&#34; said a voice&#10;in the flames; and it was as if a thousand voices echoed the words;&#10;and the flames darted up through the chimney, and went out at the&#10;top. Then a number of tiny beings, as many in number as the flowers&#10;on the flax had been, and invisible to mortal eyes, floated above&#10;them. They were even lighter and more delicate than the flowers&#10;from which they were born; and as the flames were extinguished, and&#10;nothing remained of the paper but black ashes, these little beings&#10;danced upon it; and whenever they touched it, bright red sparks&#10;appeared.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The children are all out of school, and the schoolmaster&#10;was the last of all,&#34; said the children. It was good fun, and they&#10;sang over the dead ashes,&#8212;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Snip, snap, snurre,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Basse lure:&#60;br /&#62;&#10;The song is ended.&#34;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But the little invisible beings said, &#34;The song is never&#10;ended; the most beautiful is yet to come.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But the children could neither hear nor understand this,&#10;nor should they; for children must not know everything.&#10;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode(''), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;THERE was once a merchant who was so rich that he could&#10;have paved the whole street with gold, and would even then have had&#10;enough for a small alley. But he did not do so; he knew the value&#10;of money better than to use it in this way. So clever was he, that&#10;every shilling he put out brought him a crown; and so he continued&#10;till he died. His son inherited his wealth, and he lived a merry&#10;life with it; he went to a masquerade every night, made kites out&#10;of five pound notes, and threw pieces of gold into the sea instead&#10;of stones, making ducks and drakes of them. In this manner he soon&#10;lost all his money. At last he had nothing left but a pair of&#10;slippers, an old dressing-gown, and four shillings. And now all his&#10;friends deserted him, they could not walk with him in the streets;&#10;but one of them, who was very good-natured, sent him an old trunk&#10;with this message, &#34;Pack up!&#34; &#34;Yes,&#34; he said, &#34;it is all very well&#10;to say &#39;pack up,&#39; &#34;but he had nothing left to pack up, therefore he&#10;seated himself in the trunk. It was a very wonderful trunk; no&#10;sooner did any one press on the lock than the trunk could fly. He&#10;shut the lid and pressed the lock, when away flew the trunk up the&#10;chimney with the merchant&#39;s son in it, right up into the clouds.&#10;Whenever the bottom of the trunk cracked, he was in a great fright,&#10;for if the trunk fell to pieces he would have made a tremendous&#10;somerset over the trees. However, he got safely in his trunk to the&#10;land of Turkey. He hid the trunk in the wood under some dry leaves,&#10;and then went into the town: he could so this very well, for the&#10;Turks always go about dressed in dressing-gowns and slippers, as he&#10;was himself. He happened to meet a nurse with a little child. &#34;I&#10;say, you Turkish nurse,&#34; cried he, &#34;what castle is that near the&#10;town, with the windows placed so high?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The king&#39;s daughter lives there,&#34; she replied; &#34;it has&#10;been prophesied that she will be very unhappy about a lover, and&#10;therefore no one is allowed to visit her, unless the king and queen&#10;are present.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Thank you,&#34; said the merchant&#39;s son. So he went back to&#10;the wood, seated himself in his trunk, flew up to the roof of the&#10;castle, and crept through the window into the princess&#39;s room. She&#10;lay on the sofa asleep, and she was so beautiful that the&#10;merchant&#39;s son could not help kissing her. Then she awoke, and was&#10;very much frightened; but he told her he was a Turkish angel, who&#10;had come down through the air to see her, which pleased her very&#10;much. He sat down by her side and talked to her: he said her eyes&#10;were like beautiful dark lakes, in which the thoughts swam about&#10;like little mermaids, and he told her that her forehead was a snowy&#10;mountain, which contained splendid halls full of pictures. And then&#10;he related to her about the stork who brings the beautiful children&#10;from the rivers. These were delightful stories; and when he asked&#10;the princess if she would marry him, she consented&#10;immediately.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But you must come on Saturday,&#34; she said; &#34;for then the&#10;king and queen will take tea with me. They will be very proud when&#10;they find that I am going to marry a Turkish angel; but you must&#10;think of some very pretty stories to tell them, for my parents like&#10;to hear stories better than anything. My mother prefers one that is&#10;deep and moral; but my father likes something funny, to make him&#10;laugh.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Very well,&#34; he replied; &#34;I shall bring you no other&#10;marriage portion than a story,&#34; and so they parted. But the&#10;princess gave him a sword which was studded with gold coins, and&#10;these he could use.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then he flew away to the town and bought a new&#10;dressing-gown, and afterwards returned to the wood, where he&#10;composed a story, so as to be ready for Saturday, which was no easy&#10;matter. It was ready however by Saturday, when he went to see the&#10;princess. The king, and queen, and the whole court, were at tea&#10;with the princess; and he was received with great&#10;politeness.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Will you tell us a story?&#34; said the queen,&#8212;&#34;one that is&#10;instructive and full of deep learning.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, but with something in it to laugh at,&#34; said the&#10;king.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Certainly,&#34; he replied, and commenced at once, asking&#10;them to listen attentively. &#34;There was once a bundle of matches&#10;that were exceedingly proud of their high descent. Their&#10;genealogical tree, that is, a large pine-tree from which they had&#10;been cut, was at one time a large, old tree in the wood. The&#10;matches now lay between a tinder-box and an old iron saucepan, and&#10;were talking about their youthful days. &#39;Ah! then we grew on the&#10;green boughs, and were as green as they; every morning and evening&#10;we were fed with diamond drops of dew. Whenever the sun shone, we&#10;felt his warm rays, and the little birds would relate stories to us&#10;as they sung. We knew that we were rich, for the other trees only&#10;wore their green dress in summer, but our family were able to array&#10;themselves in green, summer and winter. But the wood-cutter came,&#10;like a great revolution, and our family fell under the axe. The&#10;head of the house obtained a situation as mainmast in a very fine&#10;ship, and can sail round the world when he will. The other branches&#10;of the family were taken to different places, and our office now is&#10;to kindle a light for common people. This is how such high-born&#10;people as we came to be in a kitchen.&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;Mine has been a very different fate,&#39; said the iron pot,&#10;which stood by the matches; &#39;from my first entrance into the world&#10;I have been used to cooking and scouring. I am the first in this&#10;house, when anything solid or useful is required. My only pleasure&#10;is to be made clean and shining after dinner, and to sit in my&#10;place and have a little sensible conversation with my neighbors.&#10;All of us, excepting the water-bucket, which is sometimes taken&#10;into the courtyard, live here together within these four walls. We&#10;get our news from the market-basket, but he sometimes tells us very&#10;unpleasant things about the people and the government. Yes, and one&#10;day an old pot was so alarmed, that he fell down and was broken to&#10;pieces. He was a liberal, I can tell you.&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;You are talking too much,&#39; said the tinder-box, and the&#10;steel struck against the flint till some sparks flew out, crying,&#10;&#39;We want a merry evening, don&#39;t we?&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;Yes, of course,&#39; said the matches, &#39;let us talk about&#10;those who are the highest born.&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;No, I don&#39;t like to be always talking of what we are,&#39;&#10;remarked the saucepan; &#39;let us think of some other amusement; I&#10;will begin. We will tell something that has happened to ourselves;&#10;that will be very easy, and interesting as well. On the Baltic Sea,&#10;near the Danish shore&#39;&#8212;&#34;&#39;What a pretty commencement!&#39; said the&#10;plates; &#39;we shall all like that story, I am sure.&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;Yes; well in my youth, I lived in a quiet family, where&#10;the furniture was polished, the floors scoured, and clean curtains&#10;put up every fortnight,&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;What an interesting way you have of relating a story,&#39;&#10;said the carpet-broom; &#39;it is easy to perceive that you have been a&#10;great deal in women&#39;s society, there is something so pure runs&#10;through what you say.&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;That is quite true,&#39; said the water-bucket; and he made&#10;a spring with joy, and splashed some water on the floor.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Then the saucepan went on with his story, and the end was&#10;as good as the beginning.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The plates rattled with pleasure, and the carpet-broom&#10;brought some green parsley out of the dust-hole and crowned the&#10;saucepan, for he knew it would vex the others; and he thought, &#39;If&#10;I crown him to-day he will crown me to-morrow.&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;Now, let us have a dance,&#39; said the fire-tongs; and then&#10;how they danced and stuck up one leg in the air. The chair-cushion&#10;in the corner burst with laughter when she saw it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;Shall I be crowned now?&#39; asked the fire-tongs; so the&#10;broom found another wreath for the tongs.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;They were only common people after all,&#39; thought the&#10;matches. The tea-urn was now asked to sing, but she said she had a&#10;cold, and could not sing without boiling heat. They all thought&#10;this was affectation, and because she did not wish to sing&#10;excepting in the parlor, when on the table with the grand&#10;people.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;In the window sat an old quill-pen, with which the maid&#10;generally wrote. There was nothing remarkable about the pen,&#10;excepting that it had been dipped too deeply in the ink, but it was&#10;proud of that.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;If the tea-urn won&#39;t sing,&#39; said the pen, &#39;she can leave&#10;it alone; there is a nightingale in a cage who can sing; she has&#10;not been taught much, certainly, but we need not say anything this&#10;evening about that.&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;I think it highly improper,&#39; said the tea-kettle, who&#10;was kitchen singer, and half-brother to the tea-urn, &#39;that a rich&#10;foreign bird should be listened to here. Is it patriotic? Let the&#10;market-basket decide what is right.&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;I certainly am vexed,&#39; said the basket; &#39;inwardly vexed,&#10;more than any one can imagine. Are we spending the evening&#10;properly? Would it not be more sensible to put the house in order?&#10;If each were in his own place I would lead a game; this would be&#10;quite another thing.&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;Let us act a play,&#39; said they all. At the same moment&#10;the door opened, and the maid came in. Then not one stirred; they&#10;all remained quite still; yet, at the same time, there was not a&#10;single pot amongst them who had not a high opinion of himself, and&#10;of what he could do if he chose.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;Yes, if we had chosen,&#39; they each thought, &#39;we might&#10;have spent a very pleasant evening.&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The maid took the matches and lighted them; dear me, how&#10;they sputtered and blazed up!&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;Now then,&#39; they thought, &#39;every one will see that we are&#10;the first. How we shine; what a light we give!&#39; Even while they&#10;spoke their light went out.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What a capital story,&#34; said the queen, &#34;I feel as if I&#10;were really in the kitchen, and could see the matches; yes, you&#10;shall marry our daughter.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Certainly,&#34; said the king, &#34;thou shalt have our&#10;daughter.&#34; The king said thou to him because he was going to be one&#10;of the family. The wedding-day was fixed, and, on the evening&#10;before, the whole city was illuminated. Cakes and sweetmeats were&#10;thrown among the people. The street boys stood on tiptoe and&#10;shouted &#34;hurrah,&#34; and whistled between their fingers; altogether it&#10;was a very splendid affair.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I will give them another treat,&#34; said the merchant&#39;s son.&#10;So he went and bought rockets and crackers, and all sorts of&#10;fire-works that could be thought of, packed them in his trunk, and&#10;flew up with it into the air. What a whizzing and popping they made&#10;as they went off! The Turks, when they saw such a sight in the air,&#10;jumped so high that their slippers flew about their ears. It was&#10;easy to believe after this that the princess was really going to&#10;marry a Turkish angel.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;As soon as the merchant&#39;s son had come down in his flying&#10;trunk to the wood after the fireworks, he thought, &#34;I will go back&#10;into the town now, and hear what they think of the entertainment.&#34;&#10;It was very natural that he should wish to know. And what strange&#10;things people did say, to be sure! every one whom he questioned had&#10;a different tale to tell, though they all thought it very&#10;beautiful.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;I saw the Turkish angel myself,&#34; said one; &#34;he had eyes&#10;like glittering stars, and a head like foaming water.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;He flew in a mantle of fire,&#34; cried another, &#34;and lovely&#10;little cherubs peeped out from the folds.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;He heard many more fine things about himself, and that the&#10;next day he was to be married. After this he went back to the&#10;forest to rest himself in his trunk. It had disappeared! A spark&#10;from the fireworks which remained had set it on fire; it was burnt&#10;to ashes! So the merchant&#39;s son could not fly any more, nor go to&#10;meet his bride. She stood all day on the roof waiting for him, and&#10;most likely she is waiting there still; while he wanders through&#10;the world telling fairy tales, but none of them so amusing as the&#10;one he related about the matches. &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode(''), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;THE little dwelling in which we lived was of clay, but the&#10;door-posts were columns of fluted marble, found near the spot on&#10;which it stood. The roof sloped nearly to the ground. It was at&#10;this time dark, brown, and ugly, but had originally been formed of&#10;blooming olive and laurel branches, brought from beyond the&#10;mountains. The house was situated in a narrow gorge, whose rocky&#10;walls rose to a perpendicular height, naked and black, while round&#10;their summits clouds often hung, looking like white living figures.&#10;Not a singing bird was ever heard there, neither did men dance to&#10;the sound of the pipe. The spot was one sacred to olden times; even&#10;its name recalled a memory of the days when it was called &#34;Delphi.&#34;&#10;Then the summits of the dark, sacred mountains were covered with&#10;snow, and the highest, mount Parnassus, glowed longest in the red&#10;evening light. The brook which rolled from it near our house, was&#10;also sacred. How well I can remember every spot in that deep,&#10;sacred solitude! A fire had been kindled in the midst of the hut,&#10;and while the hot ashes lay there red and glowing, the bread was&#10;baked in them. At times the snow would be piled so high around our&#10;hut as almost to hide it, and then my mother appeared most&#10;cheerful. She would hold my head between her hands, and sing the&#10;songs she never sang at other times, for the Turks, our masters,&#10;would not allow it. She sang,&#8212;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;On the summit of mount Olympus, in a forest of dwarf&#10;firs, lay an old stag. His eyes were heavy with tears, and&#10;glittering with colors like dewdrops; and there came by a roebuck,&#10;and said, &#39;What ailest thee, that thou weepest blue and red tears?&#39;&#10;And the stag answered, &#39;The Turk has come to our city; he has wild&#10;dogs for the chase, a goodly pack.&#39; &#39;I will drive them away across&#10;the islands!&#39; cried the young roebuck; &#39;I will drive them away&#10;across the islands into the deep sea.&#39; But before evening the&#10;roebuck was slain, and before night the hunted stag was&#10;dead.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And when my mother sang thus, her eyes would become moist;&#10;and on the long eyelashes were tears, but she concealed them and&#10;watched the black bread baking in the ashes. Then I would clench my&#10;fist, and cry, &#34;We will kill these Turks!&#34; But she repeated the&#10;words of the song, &#34;I will drive them across the islands to the&#10;deep sea; but before evening came the roebuck was slain, and before&#10;the night the hunted stag was dead.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;We had been lonely in our hut for several days and nights&#10;when my father came home. I knew he would bring me some shells from&#10;the gulf of Lepanto, or perhaps a knife with a shining blade. This&#10;time he brought, under his sheep-skin cloak, a little child, a&#10;little half-naked girl. She was wrapped in a fur; but when this was&#10;taken off, and she lay in my mother&#39;s lap, three silver coins were&#10;found fastened in her dark hair; they were all her possessions. My&#10;father told us that the child&#39;s parents had been killed by the&#10;Turks, and he talked so much about them that I dreamed of Turks all&#10;night. He himself had been wounded, and my mother bound up his arm.&#10;It was a deep wound, and the thick sheep-skin cloak was stiff with&#10;congealed blood. The little maiden was to be my sister. How pretty&#10;and bright she looked: even my mother&#39;s eyes were not more gentle&#10;than hers. Anastasia, as she was called, was to be my sister,&#10;because her father had been united to mine by an old custom, which&#10;we still follow. They had sworn brotherhood in their youth, and the&#10;most beautiful and virtuous maiden in the neighborhood was chosen&#10;to perform the act of consecration upon this bond of friendship. So&#10;now this little girl was my sister. She sat in my lap, and I&#10;brought her flowers, and feathers from the birds of the mountain.&#10;We drank together of the waters of Parnassus, and dwelt for many&#10;years beneath the laurel roof of the hut, while, winter after&#10;winter, my mother sang her song of the stag who shed red tears. But&#10;as yet I did not understand that the sorrows of my own countrymen&#10;were mirrored in those tears.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;One day there came to our hut Franks, men from a far&#10;country, whose dress was different to ours. They had tents and beds&#10;with them, carried by horses; and they were accompanied by more&#10;than twenty Turks, all armed with swords and muskets. These Franks&#10;were friends of the Pacha, and had letters from him, commanding an&#10;escort for them. They only came to see our mountain, to ascend&#10;Parnassus amid the snow and clouds, and to look at the strange&#10;black rocks which raised their steep sides near our hut. They could&#10;not find room in the hut, nor endure the smoke that rolled along&#10;the ceiling till it found its way out at the low door; so they&#10;pitched their tents on a small space outside our dwelling. Roasted&#10;lambs and birds were brought forth, and strong, sweet wine, of&#10;which the Turks are forbidden to partake.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;When they departed, I accompanied them for some distance,&#10;carrying my little sister Anastasia, wrapped in a goat-skin, on my&#10;back. One of the Frankish gentlemen made me stand in front of a&#10;rock, and drew us both as we stood there, so that we looked like&#10;one creature. I did not think of it then, but Anastasia and I were&#10;really one. She was always sitting on my lap, or riding in the&#10;goat-skin on my back; and in my dreams she always appeared to&#10;me.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Two nights after this, other men, armed with knives and&#10;muskets, came into our tent. They were Albanians, brave men, my&#10;mother told me. They only stayed a short time. My sister Anastasia&#10;sat on the knee of one of them; and when they were gone, she had&#10;not three, but two silver coins in her hair&#8212;one had disappeared.&#10;They wrapped tobacco in strips of paper, and smoked it; and I&#10;remember they were uncertain as to the road they ought to take. But&#10;they were obliged to go at last, and my father went with them. Soon&#10;after, we heard the sound of firing. The noise continued, and&#10;presently soldiers rushed into our hut, and took my mother and&#10;myself and Anastasia prisoners. They declared that we had&#10;entertained robbers, and that my father had acted as their guide,&#10;and therefore we must now go with them. The corpses of the robbers,&#10;and my father&#39;s corpse, were brought into the hut. I saw my poor&#10;dead father, and cried till I fell asleep. When I awoke, I found&#10;myself in a prison; but the room was not worse than our own in the&#10;hut. They gave me onions and musty wine from a tarred cask; but we&#10;were not accustomed to much better fare at home. How long we were&#10;kept in prison, I do not know; but many days and nights passed by.&#10;We were set free about Easter-time. I carried Anastasia on my back,&#10;and we walked very slowly; for my mother was very weak, and it is a&#10;long way to the sea, to the Gulf of Lepanto.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;On our arrival, we entered a church, in which there were&#10;beautiful pictures in golden frames. They were pictures of angels,&#10;fair and bright; and yet our little Anastasia looked equally&#10;beautiful, as it seemed to me. In the centre of the floor stood a&#10;coffin filled with roses. My mother told me it was the Lord Jesus&#10;Christ who was represented by these roses. Then the priest&#10;announced, &#34;Christ is risen,&#34; and all the people greeted each&#10;other. Each one carried a burning taper in his hand, and one was&#10;given to me, as well as to little Anastasia. The music sounded, and&#10;the people left the church hand-in-hand, with joy and gladness.&#10;Outside, the women were roasting the paschal lamb. We were invited&#10;to partake; and as I sat by the fire, a boy, older than myself, put&#10;his arms round my neck, and kissed me, and said, &#34;Christ is risen.&#34;&#10;And thus it was that for the first time I met&#10;Aphtanides.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;My mother could make fishermen&#39;s nets, for which there was&#10;a great demand here in the bay; and we lived a long time by the&#10;side of the sea, the beautiful sea, that had a taste like tears,&#10;and in its colors reminded me of the stag that wept red tears; for&#10;sometimes its waters were red, and sometimes green or blue.&#10;Aphtanides knew how to manage our boat, and I often sat in it, with&#10;my little Anastasia, while it glided on through the water, swift as&#10;a bird flying through the air. Then, when the sun set, how&#10;beautifully, deeply blue, would be the tint on the mountains, one&#10;rising above the other in the far distance, and the summit of mount&#10;Parnassus rising above them all like a glorious crown. Its top&#10;glittered in the evening rays like molten gold, and it seemed as if&#10;the light came from within it; for long after the sun had sunk&#10;beneath the horizon, the mountain-top would glow in the clear, blue&#10;sky. The white aquatic birds skimmed the surface of the water in&#10;their flight, and all was calm and still as amid the black rocks at&#10;Delphi. I lay on my back in the boat, Anastasia leaned against me,&#10;while the stars above us glittered more brightly than the lamps in&#10;our church. They were the same stars, and in the same position over&#10;me as when I used to sit in front of our hut at Delphi, and I had&#10;almost begun to fancy I was still there, when suddenly there was a&#10;splash in the water&#8212;Anastasia had fallen in; but in a moment&#10;Aphtanides has sprung in after her, and was now holding her up to&#10;me. We dried her clothes as well as we were able, and remained on&#10;the water till they were dry; for we did not wish it to be known&#10;what a fright we had had, nor the danger which our little adopted&#10;sister had incurred, in whose life Aphtanides had now a&#10;part.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The summer came, and the burning heat of the sun tinted&#10;the leaves of the trees with lines of gold. I thought of our cool&#10;mountain-home, and the fresh water that flowed near it; my mother,&#10;too, longed for if, and one evening we wandered towards home. How&#10;peaceful and silent it was as we walked on through the thick, wild&#10;thyme, still fragrant, though the sun had scorched the leaves. Not&#10;a single herdsman did we meet, not a solitary hut did we pass;&#10;everything appeared lonely and deserted&#8212;only a shooting star showed&#10;that in the heavens there was yet life. I know not whether the&#10;clear, blue atmosphere gleamed with its own light, or if the&#10;radiance came from the stars; but we could distinguish quite&#10;plainly the outline of the mountains. My mother lighted a fire, and&#10;roasted some roots she had brought with her, and I and my little&#10;sister slept among the bushes, without fear of the ugly smidraki,&#10;from whose throat issues fire, or of the wolf and the jackal; for&#10;my mother sat by us, and I considered her presence sufficient&#10;protection.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;We reached our old home; but the cottage was in ruins, and&#10;we had to build a new one. With the aid of some neighbors, chiefly&#10;women, the walls were in a few days erected, and very soon covered&#10;with a roof of olive-branches. My mother obtained a living by&#10;making bottle-cases of bark and skins, and I kept the sheep&#10;belonging to the priests, who were sometimes peasants, while I had&#10;for my playfellows Anastasia and the turtles.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Once our beloved Aphtanides paid us a visit. He said he&#10;had been longing to see us so much; and he remained with us two&#10;whole happy days. A month afterwards he came again to wish us&#10;good-bye, and brought with him a large fish for my mother. He told&#10;us he was going in a ship to Corfu and Patras, and could relate a&#10;great many stories, not only about the fishermen who lived near the&#10;gulf of Lepanto, but also of kings and heroes who had once&#10;possessed Greece, just as the Turks possess it now.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;I have seen a bud on a rose-bush gradually, in the course&#10;of a few weeks, unfold its leaves till it became a rose in all its&#10;beauty; and, before I was aware of it, I beheld it blooming in rosy&#10;loveliness. The same thing had happened to Anastasia. Unnoticed by&#10;me, she had gradually become a beautiful maiden, and I was now also&#10;a stout, strong youth. The wolf-skins that covered the bed in which&#10;my mother and Anastasia slept, had been taken from wolves which I&#10;had myself shot.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Years had gone by when, one evening, Aphtanides came in.&#10;He had grown tall and slender as a reed, with strong limbs, and a&#10;dark, brown skin. He kissed us all, and had so much to tell of what&#10;he had seen of the great ocean, of the fortifications at Malta, and&#10;of the marvellous sepulchres of Egypt, that I looked up to him with&#10;a kind of veneration. His stories were as strange as the legends of&#10;the priests of olden times.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;How much you know!&#34; I exclaimed, &#34;and what wonders you&#10;can relate?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I think what you once told me, the finest of all,&#34; he&#10;replied; &#34;you told me of a thing that has never been out of my&#10;thoughts&#8212;of the good old custom of &#39;the bond of friendship,&#39;&#8212;a&#10;custom I should like to follow. Brother, let you and I go to&#10;church, as your father and Anastasia&#39;s father once did. Your sister&#10;Anastasia is the most beautiful and most innocent of maidens, and&#10;she shall consecrate the deed. No people have such grand old&#10;customs as we Greeks.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Anastasia blushed like a young rose, and my mother kissed&#10;Aphtanides.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;At about two miles from our cottage, where the earth on&#10;the hill is sheltered by a few scattered trees, stood the little&#10;church, with a silver lamp hanging before the altar. I put on my&#10;best clothes, and the white tunic fell in graceful folds over my&#10;hips. The red jacket fitted tight and close, the tassel on my Fez&#10;cap was of silver, and in my girdle glittered a knife and my&#10;pistols. Aphtanides was clad in the blue dress worn by the Greek&#10;sailors; on his breast hung a silver medal with the figure of the&#10;Virgin Mary, and his scarf was as costly as those worn by rich&#10;lords. Every one could see that we were about to perform a solemn&#10;ceremony. When we entered the little, unpretending church, the&#10;evening sunlight streamed through the open door on the burning&#10;lamp, and glittered on the golden picture frames. We knelt down&#10;together on the altar steps, and Anastasia drew near and stood&#10;beside us. A long, white garment fell in graceful folds over her&#10;delicate form, and on her white neck and bosom hung a chain&#10;entwined with old and new coins, forming a kind of collar. Her&#10;black hair was fastened into a knot, and confined by a headdress&#10;formed of gold and silver coins which had been found in an ancient&#10;temple. No Greek girl had more beautiful ornaments than these. Her&#10;countenance glowed, and her eyes were like two stars. We all three&#10;offered a silent prayer, and then she said to us, &#34;Will you be&#10;friends in life and in death?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes,&#34; we replied.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Will you each remember to say, whatever may happen, &#39;My&#10;brother is a part of myself; his secret is my secret, my happiness&#10;is his; self-sacrifice, patience, everything belongs to me as they&#10;do to him?&#39;&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And we again answered, &#34;Yes.&#34; Then she joined out hands&#10;and kissed us on the forehead, and we again prayed silently. After&#10;this a priest came through a door near the altar, and blessed us&#10;all three. Then a song was sung by other holy men behind the&#10;altar-screen, and the bond of eternal friendship was confirmed.&#10;When we arose, I saw my mother standing by the church door,&#10;weeping.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;How cheerful everything seemed now in our little cottage&#10;by the Delphian springs! On the evening before his departure,&#10;Aphtanides sat thoughtfully beside me on the slopes of the&#10;mountain. His arm was flung around me, and mine was round his neck.&#10;We spoke of the sorrows of Greece, and of the men of the country&#10;who could be trusted. Every thought of our souls lay clear before&#10;us. Presently I seized his hand: &#34;Aphtanides,&#34; I exclaimed, &#34;there&#10;is one thing still that you must know,&#8212;one thing that till now has&#10;been a secret between myself and Heaven. My whole soul is filled&#10;with love,&#8212;with a love stronger than the love I bear to my mother&#10;and to thee.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And whom do you love?&#34; asked Aphtanides. And his face and&#10;neck grew red as fire.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I love Anastasia,&#34; I replied.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then his hand trembled in mine, and he became pale as a&#10;corpse. I saw it, I understood the cause, and I believe my hand&#10;trembled too. I bent towards him, I kissed his forehead, and&#10;whispered, &#34;I have never spoken of this to her, and perhaps she&#10;does not love me. Brother, think of this; I have seen her daily,&#10;she has grown up beside me, and has become a part of my&#10;soul.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And she shall be thine,&#34; he exclaimed; &#34;thine! I may not&#10;wrong thee, nor will I do so. I also love her, but tomorrow I&#10;depart. In a year we will see each other again, but then you will&#10;be married; shall it not be so? I have a little gold of my own, it&#10;shall be yours. You must and shall take it.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;We wandered silently homeward across the mountains. It was&#10;late in the evening when we reached my mother&#39;s door. Anastasia&#10;held the lamp as we entered; my mother was not there. She looked at&#10;Aphtanides with a sweet but mournful expression on her face.&#10;&#34;To-morrow you are going to leave us,&#34; she said. &#34;I am very&#10;sorry.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Sorry!&#34; he exclaimed, and his voice was troubled with a&#10;grief as deep as my own. I could not speak; but he seized her hand&#10;and said, &#34;Our brother yonder loves you, and is he not dear to you?&#10;His very silence now proves his affection.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Anastasia trembled, and burst into tears. Then I saw no&#10;one, thought of none, but her. I threw my arms round her, and&#10;pressed my lips to hers. As she flung her arms round my neck, the&#10;lamp fell to the ground, and we were in darkness, dark as the heart&#10;of poor Aphtanides.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Before daybreak he rose, kissed us all, and said&#10;&#34;Farewell,&#34; and went away. He had given all his money to my mother&#10;for us. Anastasia was betrothed to me, and in a few days afterwards&#10;she became my wife. &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode(''), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;THERE was once a girl who trod on a loaf to avoid soiling&#10;her shoes, and the misfortunes that happened to her in consequence&#10;are well known. Her name was Inge; she was a poor child, but proud&#10;and presuming, and with a bad and cruel disposition. When quite a&#10;little child she would delight in catching flies, and tearing off&#10;their wings, so as to make creeping things of them. When older, she&#10;would take cockchafers and beetles, and stick pins through them.&#10;Then she pushed a green leaf, or a little scrap of paper towards&#10;their feet, and when the poor creatures would seize it and hold it&#10;fast, and turn over and over in their struggles to get free from&#10;the pin, she would say, &#34;The cockchafer is reading; see how he&#10;turns over the leaf.&#34; She grew worse instead of better with years,&#10;and, unfortunately, she was pretty, which caused her to be excused,&#10;when she should have been sharply reproved.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Your headstrong will requires severity to conquer it,&#34;&#10;her mother often said to her. &#34;As a little child you used to&#10;trample on my apron, but one day I fear you will trample on my&#10;heart.&#34; And, alas! this fear was realized.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Inge was taken to the house of some rich people, who lived&#10;at a distance, and who treated her as their own child, and dressed&#10;her so fine that her pride and arrogance increased.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;When she had been there about a year, her patroness said&#10;to her, &#34;You ought to go, for once, and see your parents,&#10;Inge.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;So Inge started to go and visit her parents; but she only&#10;wanted to show herself in her native place, that the people might&#10;see how fine she was. She reached the entrance of the village, and&#10;saw the young laboring men and maidens standing together chatting,&#10;and her own mother amongst them. Inge&#39;s mother was sitting on a&#10;stone to rest, with a fagot of sticks lying before her, which she&#10;had picked up in the wood. Then Inge turned back; she who was so&#10;finely dressed she felt ashamed of her mother, a poorly clad woman,&#10;who picked up wood in the forest. She did not turn back out of pity&#10;for her mother&#39;s poverty, but from pride.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Another half-year went by, and her mistress said, &#34;you&#10;ought to go home again, and visit your parents, Inge, and I will&#10;give you a large wheaten loaf to take to them, they will be glad to&#10;see you, I am sure.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;So Inge put on her best clothes, and her new shoes, drew&#10;her dress up around her, and set out, stepping very carefully, that&#10;she might be clean and neat about the feet, and there was nothing&#10;wrong in doing so. But when she came to the place where the&#10;footpath led across the moor, she found small pools of water, and a&#10;great deal of mud, so she threw the loaf into the mud, and trod&#10;upon it, that she might pass without wetting her feet. But as she&#10;stood with one foot on the loaf and the other lifted up to step&#10;forward, the loaf began to sink under her, lower and lower, till&#10;she disappeared altogether, and only a few bubbles on the surface&#10;of the muddy pool remained to show where she had sunk. And this is&#10;the story.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But where did Inge go? She sank into the ground, and went&#10;down to the Marsh Woman, who is always brewing there.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Marsh Woman is related to the elf maidens, who are&#10;well-known, for songs are sung and pictures painted about them. But&#10;of the Marsh Woman nothing is known, excepting that when a mist&#10;arises from the meadows, in summer time, it is because she is&#10;brewing beneath them. To the Marsh Woman&#39;s brewery Inge sunk down&#10;to a place which no one can endure for long. A heap of mud is a&#10;palace compared with the Marsh Woman&#39;s brewery; and as Inge fell&#10;she shuddered in every limb, and soon became cold and stiff as&#10;marble. Her foot was still fastened to the loaf, which bowed her&#10;down as a golden ear of corn bends the stem.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;An evil spirit soon took possession of Inge, and carried&#10;her to a still worse place, in which she saw crowds of unhappy&#10;people, waiting in a state of agony for the gates of mercy to be&#10;opened to them, and in every heart was a miserable and eternal&#10;feeling of unrest. It would take too much time to describe the&#10;various tortures these people suffered, but Inge&#39;s punishment&#10;consisted in standing there as a statue, with her foot fastened to&#10;the loaf. She could move her eyes about, and see all the misery&#10;around her, but she could not turn her head; and when she saw the&#10;people looking at her she thought they were admiring her pretty&#10;face and fine clothes, for she was still vain and proud. But she&#10;had forgotten how soiled her clothes had become while in the Marsh&#10;Woman&#39;s brewery, and that they were covered with mud; a snake had&#10;also fastened itself in her hair, and hung down her back, while&#10;from each fold in her dress a great toad peeped out and croaked&#10;like an asthmatic poodle. Worse than all was the terrible hunger&#10;that tormented her, and she could not stoop to break off a piece of&#10;the loaf on which she stood. No; her back was too stiff, and her&#10;whole body like a pillar of stone. And then came creeping over her&#10;face and eyes flies without wings; she winked and blinked, but they&#10;could not fly away, for their wings had been pulled off; this,&#10;added to the hunger she felt, was horrible torture.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;If this lasts much longer,&#34; she said, &#34;I shall not be&#10;able to bear it.&#34; But it did last, and she had to bear it, without&#10;being able to help herself.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A tear, followed by many scalding tears, fell upon her&#10;head, and rolled over her face and neck, down to the loaf on which&#10;she stood. Who could be weeping for Inge? She had a mother in the&#10;world still, and the tears of sorrow which a mother sheds for her&#10;child will always find their way to the child&#39;s heart, but they&#10;often increase the torment instead of being a relief. And Inge&#10;could hear all that was said about her in the world she had left,&#10;and every one seemed cruel to her. The sin she had committed in&#10;treading on the loaf was known on earth, for she had been seen by&#10;the cowherd from the hill, when she was crossing the marsh and had&#10;disappeared.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;When her mother wept and exclaimed, &#34;Ah, Inge! what grief&#10;thou hast caused thy mother&#34; she would say, &#34;Oh that I had never&#10;been born! My mother&#39;s tears are useless now.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And then the words of the kind people who had adopted her&#10;came to her ears, when they said, &#34;Inge was a sinful girl, who did&#10;not value the gifts of God, but trampled them under her&#10;feet.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ah,&#34; thought Inge, &#34;they should have punished me, and&#10;driven all my naughty tempers out of me.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A song was made about &#34;The girl who trod on a loaf to keep&#10;her shoes from being soiled,&#34; and this song was sung everywhere.&#10;The story of her sin was also told to the little children, and they&#10;called her &#34;wicked Inge,&#34; and said she was so naughty that she&#10;ought to be punished. Inge heard all this, and her heart became&#10;hardened and full of bitterness.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But one day, while hunger and grief were gnawing in her&#10;hollow frame, she heard a little, innocent child, while listening&#10;to the tale of the vain, haughty Inge, burst into tears and&#10;exclaim, &#34;But will she never come up again?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And she heard the reply, &#34;No, she will never come up&#10;again.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But if she were to say she was sorry, and ask pardon, and&#10;promise never to do so again?&#34; asked the little one.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, then she might come; but she will not beg pardon,&#34;&#10;was the answer.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, I wish she would!&#34; said the child, who was quite&#10;unhappy about it. &#34;I should be so glad. I would give up my doll and&#10;all my playthings, if she could only come here again. Poor Inge! it&#10;is so dreadful for her.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;These pitying words penetrated to Inge&#39;s inmost heart, and&#10;seemed to do her good. It was the first time any one had said,&#10;&#34;Poor Inge!&#34; without saying something about her faults. A little&#10;innocent child was weeping, and praying for mercy for her. It made&#10;her feel quite strange, and she would gladly have wept herself, and&#10;it added to her torment to find she could not do so. And while she&#10;thus suffered in a place where nothing changed, years passed away&#10;on earth, and she heard her name less frequently mentioned. But one&#10;day a sigh reached her ear, and the words, &#34;Inge! Inge! what a&#10;grief thou hast been to me! I said it would be so.&#34; It was the last&#10;sigh of her dying mother.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;After this, Inge heard her kind mistress say, &#34;Ah, poor&#10;Inge! shall I ever see thee again? Perhaps I may, for we know not&#10;what may happen in the future.&#34; But Inge knew right well that her&#10;mistress would never come to that dreadful place.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Time-passed&#8212;a long bitter time&#8212;then Inge heard her name&#10;pronounced once more, and saw what seemed two bright stars shining&#10;above her. They were two gentle eyes closing on earth. Many years&#10;had passed since the little girl had lamented and wept about &#34;poor&#10;Inge.&#34; That child was now an old woman, whom God was taking to&#10;Himself. In the last hour of existence the events of a whole life&#10;often appear before us; and this hour the old woman remembered how,&#10;when a child, she had shed tears over the story of Inge, and she&#10;prayed for her now. As the eyes of the old woman closed to earth,&#10;the eyes of the soul opened upon the hidden things of eternity, and&#10;then she, in whose last thoughts Inge had been so vividly present,&#10;saw how deeply the poor girl had sunk. She burst into tears at the&#10;sight, and in heaven, as she had done when a little child on earth,&#10;she wept and prayed for poor Inge. Her tears and her prayers echoed&#10;through the dark void that surrounded the tormented captive soul,&#10;and the unexpected mercy was obtained for it through an angel&#39;s&#10;tears. As in thought Inge seemed to act over again every sin she&#10;had committed on earth, she trembled, and tears she had never yet&#10;been able to weep rushed to her eyes. It seemed impossible that the&#10;gates of mercy could ever be opened to her; but while she&#10;acknowledged this in deep penitence, a beam of radiant light shot&#10;suddenly into the depths upon her. More powerful than the sunbeam&#10;that dissolves the man of snow which the children have raised, more&#10;quickly than the snowflake melts and becomes a drop of water on the&#10;warm lips of a child, was the stony form of Inge changed, and as a&#10;little bird she soared, with the speed of lightning, upward to the&#10;world of mortals. A bird that felt timid and shy to all things&#10;around it, that seemed to shrink with shame from meeting any living&#10;creature, and hurriedly sought to conceal itself in a dark corner&#10;of an old ruined wall; there it sat cowering and unable to utter a&#10;sound, for it was voiceless. Yet how quickly the little bird&#10;discovered the beauty of everything around it. The sweet, fresh&#10;air; the soft radiance of the moon, as its light spread over the&#10;earth; the fragrance which exhaled from bush and tree, made it feel&#10;happy as it sat there clothed in its fresh, bright plumage. All&#10;creation seemed to speak of beneficence and love. The bird wanted&#10;to give utterance to thoughts that stirred in his breast, as the&#10;cuckoo and the nightingale in the spring, but it could not. Yet in&#10;heaven can be heard the song of praise, even from a worm; and the&#10;notes trembling in the breast of the bird were as audible to Heaven&#10;even as the psalms of David before they had fashioned themselves&#10;into words and song.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Christmas-time drew near, and a peasant who dwelt close by&#10;the old wall stuck up a pole with some ears of corn fastened to the&#10;top, that the birds of heaven might have feast, and rejoice in the&#10;happy, blessed time. And on Christmas morning the sun arose and&#10;shone upon the ears of corn, which were quickly surrounded by a&#10;number of twittering birds. Then, from a hole in the wall, gushed&#10;forth in song the swelling thoughts of the bird as he issued from&#10;his hiding place to perform his first good deed on earth,&#8212;and in&#10;heaven it was well known who that bird was.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The winter was very hard; the ponds were covered with ice,&#10;and there was very little food for either the beasts of the field&#10;or the birds of the air. Our little bird flew away into the public&#10;roads, and found here and there, in the ruts of the sledges, a&#10;grain of corn, and at the halting places some crumbs. Of these he&#10;ate only a few, but he called around him the other birds and the&#10;hungry sparrows, that they too might have food. He flew into the&#10;towns, and looked about, and wherever a kind hand had strewed bread&#10;on the window-sill for the birds, he only ate a single crumb&#10;himself, and gave all the rest to the rest of the other birds. In&#10;the course of the winter the bird had in this way collected many&#10;crumbs and given them to other birds, till they equalled the weight&#10;of the loaf on which Inge had trod to keep her shoes clean; and&#10;when the last bread-crumb had been found and given, the gray wings&#10;of the bird became white, and spread themselves out for&#10;flight.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;See, yonder is a sea-gull!&#34; cried the children, when they&#10;saw the white bird, as it dived into the sea, and rose again into&#10;the clear sunlight, white and glittering. But no one could tell&#10;whither it went then although some declared it flew straight to the&#10;sun. &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode(''), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;THERE was once a regular student, who lived in a garret,&#10;and had no possessions. And there was also a regular huckster, to&#10;whom the house belonged, and who occupied the ground floor. A&#10;goblin lived with the huckster, because at Christmas he always had&#10;a large dish full of jam, with a great piece of butter in the&#10;middle. The huckster could afford this; and therefore the goblin&#10;remained with the huckster, which was very cunning of&#10;him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;One evening the student came into the shop through the&#10;back door to buy candles and cheese for himself, he had no one to&#10;send, and therefore he came himself; he obtained what he wished,&#10;and then the huckster and his wife nodded good evening to him, and&#10;she was a woman who could do more than merely nod, for she had&#10;usually plenty to say for herself. The student nodded in return as&#10;he turned to leave, then suddenly stopped, and began reading the&#10;piece of paper in which the cheese was wrapped. It was a leaf torn&#10;out of an old book, a book that ought not to have been torn up, for&#10;it was full of poetry.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yonder lies some more of the same sort,&#34; said the&#10;huckster: &#34;I gave an old woman a few coffee berries for it; you&#10;shall have the rest for sixpence, if you will.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Indeed I will,&#34; said the student; &#34;give me the book&#10;instead of the cheese; I can eat my bread and butter without&#10;cheese. It would be a sin to tear up a book like this. You are a&#10;clever man; and a practical man; but you understand no more about&#10;poetry than that cask yonder.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;This was a very rude speech, especially against the cask;&#10;but the huckster and the student both laughed, for it was only said&#10;in fun. But the goblin felt very angry that any man should venture&#10;to say such things to a huckster who was a householder and sold the&#10;best butter. As soon as it was night, and the shop closed, and&#10;every one in bed except the student, the goblin stepped softly into&#10;the bedroom where the huckster&#39;s wife slept, and took away her&#10;tongue, which of course, she did not then want. Whatever object in&#10;the room he placed his tongue upon immediately received voice and&#10;speech, and was able to express its thoughts and feelings as&#10;readily as the lady herself could do. It could only be used by one&#10;object at a time, which was a good thing, as a number speaking at&#10;once would have caused great confusion. The goblin laid the tongue&#10;upon the cask, in which lay a quantity of old&#10;newspapers.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Is it really true,&#34; he asked, that you do not know what&#10;poetry is?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Of course I know,&#34; replied the cask: &#34;poetry is something&#10;that always stand in the corner of a newspaper, and is sometimes&#10;cut out; and I may venture to affirm that I have more of it in me&#10;than the student has, and I am only a poor tub of the&#10;huckster&#39;s.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the goblin placed the tongue on the coffee mill; and&#10;how it did go to be sure! Then he put it on the butter tub and the&#10;cash box, and they all expressed the same opinion as the&#10;waste-paper tub; and a majority must always be&#10;respected.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Now I shall go and tell the student,&#34; said the goblin;&#10;and with these words he went quietly up the back stairs to the&#10;garret where the student lived. He had a candle burning still, and&#10;the goblin peeped through the keyhole and saw that he was reading&#10;in the torn book, which he had brought out of the shop. But how&#10;light the room was! From the book shot forth a ray of light which&#10;grew broad and full, like the stem of a tree, from which bright&#10;rays spread upward and over the student&#39;s head. Each leaf was&#10;fresh, and each flower was like a beautiful female head; some with&#10;dark and sparkling eyes, and others with eyes that were wonderfully&#10;blue and clear. The fruit gleamed like stars, and the room was&#10;filled with sounds of beautiful music. The little goblin had never&#10;imagined, much less seen or heard of, any sight so glorious as&#10;this. He stood still on tiptoe, peeping in, till the light went out&#10;in the garret. The student no doubt had blown out his candle and&#10;gone to bed; but the little goblin remained standing there&#10;nevertheless, and listening to the music which still sounded on,&#10;soft and beautiful, a sweet cradle-song for the student, who had&#10;lain down to rest.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;This is a wonderful place,&#34; said the goblin; &#34;I never&#10;expected such a thing. I should like to stay here with the&#10;student;&#34; and the little man thought it over, for he was a sensible&#10;little spirit. At last he sighed, &#34;but the student has no jam!&#34; So&#10;he went down stairs again into the huckster&#39;s shop, and it was a&#10;good thing he got back when he did, for the cask had almost worn&#10;out the lady&#39;s tongue; he had given a description of all that he&#10;contained on one side, and was just about to turn himself over to&#10;the other side to describe what was there, when the goblin entered&#10;and restored the tongue to the lady. But from that time forward,&#10;the whole shop, from the cash box down to the pinewood logs, formed&#10;their opinions from that of the cask; and they all had such&#10;confidence in him, and treated him with so much respect, that when&#10;the huckster read the criticisms on theatricals and art of an&#10;evening, they fancied it must all come from the cask.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But after what he had seen, the goblin could no longer sit&#10;and listen quietly to the wisdom and understanding down stairs; so,&#10;as soon as the evening light glimmered in the garret, he took&#10;courage, for it seemed to him as if the rays of light were strong&#10;cables, drawing him up, and obliging him to go and peep through the&#10;keyhole; and, while there, a feeling of vastness came over him such&#10;as we experience by the ever-moving sea, when the storm breaks&#10;forth; and it brought tears into his eyes. He did not himself know&#10;why he wept, yet a kind of pleasant feeling mingled with his tears.&#10;&#34;How wonderfully glorious it would be to sit with the student under&#10;such a tree;&#34; but that was out of the question, he must be content&#10;to look through the keyhole, and be thankful for even&#10;that.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;There he stood on the old landing, with the autumn wind&#10;blowing down upon him through the trap-door. It was very cold; but&#10;the little creature did not really feel it, till the light in the&#10;garret went out, and the tones of music died away. Then how he&#10;shivered, and crept down stairs again to his warm corner, where it&#10;felt home-like and comfortable. And when Christmas came again, and&#10;brought the dish of jam and the great lump of butter, he liked the&#10;huckster best of all.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Soon after, in the middle of the night, the goblin was&#10;awoke by a terrible noise and knocking against the window shutters&#10;and the house doors, and by the sound of the watchman&#39;s horn; for a&#10;great fire had broken out, and the whole street appeared full of&#10;flames. Was it in their house, or a neighbor&#39;s? No one could tell,&#10;for terror had seized upon all. The huckster&#39;s wife was so&#10;bewildered that she took her gold ear-rings out of her ears and put&#10;them in her pocket, that she might save something at least. The&#10;huckster ran to get his business papers, and the servant resolved&#10;to save her blue silk mantle, which she had managed to buy. Each&#10;wished to keep the best things they had. The goblin had the same&#10;wish; for, with one spring, he was up stairs and in the student&#39;s&#10;room, whom he found standing by the open window, and looking quite&#10;calmly at the fire, which was raging at the house of a neighbor&#10;opposite. The goblin caught up the wonderful book which lay on the&#10;table, and popped it into his red cap, which he held tightly with&#10;both hands. The greatest treasure in the house was saved; and he&#10;ran away with it to the roof, and seated himself on the chimney.&#10;The flames of the burning house opposite illuminated him as he sat,&#10;both hands pressed tightly over his cap, in which the treasure lay;&#10;and then he found out what feelings really reigned in his heart,&#10;and knew exactly which way they tended. And yet, when the fire was&#10;extinguished, and the goblin again began to reflect, he hesitated,&#10;and said at last, &#34;I must divide myself between the two; I cannot&#10;quite give up the huckster, because of the jam.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And this is a representation of human nature. We are like&#10;the goblin; we all go to visit the huckster &#34;because of the jam.&#34;&#10;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode(''), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;THE drummer&#39;s wife went into the church. She saw the new&#10;altar with the painted pictures and the carved angels. Those upon&#10;the canvas and in the glory over the altar were just as beautiful&#10;as the carved ones; and they were painted and gilt into the&#10;bargain. Their hair gleamed golden in the sunshine, lovely to&#10;behold; but the real sunshine was more beautiful still. It shone&#10;redder, clearer through the dark trees, when the sun went down. It&#10;was lovely thus to look at the sunshine of heaven. And she looked&#10;at the red sun, and she thought about it so deeply, and thought of&#10;the little one whom the stork was to bring, and the wife of the&#10;drummer was very cheerful, and looked and looked, and wished that&#10;the child might have a gleam of sunshine given to it, so that it&#10;might at least become like one of the shining angels over the&#10;altar.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And when she really had the little child in her arms, and&#10;held it up to its father, then it was like one of the angels in the&#10;church to behold, with hair like gold&#8212;the gleam of the setting sun&#10;was upon it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;My golden treasure, my riches, my sunshine!&#34; said the&#10;mother; and she kissed the shining locks, and it sounded like music&#10;and song in the room of the drummer; and there was joy, and life,&#10;and movement. The drummer beat a roll&#8212;a roll of joy. And the Drum&#10;said&#8212;the Fire-drum, that was beaten when there was a fire in the&#10;town:&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Red hair! the little fellow has red hair! Believe the&#10;drum, and not what your mother says! Rub-a dub, rub-a&#10;dub!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the town repeated what the Fire-drum had&#10;said.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The boy was taken to church, the boy was christened. There&#10;was nothing much to be said about his name; he was called Peter.&#10;The whole town, and the Drum too, called him Peter the drummer&#39;s&#10;boy with the red hair; but his mother kissed his red hair, and&#10;called him her golden treasure.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the hollow way in the clayey bank, many had scratched&#10;their names as a remembrance.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Celebrity is always something!&#34; said the drummer; and so&#10;he scratched his own name there, and his little son&#39;s name&#10;likewise.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the swallows came. They had, on their long journey,&#10;seen more durable characters engraven on rocks, and on the walls of&#10;the temples in Hindostan, mighty deeds of great kings, immortal&#10;names, so old that no one now could read or speak them. Remarkable&#10;celebrity!&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the clayey bank the martens built their nest. They&#10;bored holes in the deep declivity, and the splashing rain and the&#10;thin mist came and crumbled and washed the names away, and the&#10;drummer&#39;s name also, and that of his little son.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Peter&#39;s name will last a full year and a half longer!&#34;&#10;said the father.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Fool!&#34; thought the Fire-drum; but it only said, &#34;Dub,&#10;dub, dub, rub-a-dub!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;He was a boy full of life and gladness, this drummer&#39;s son&#10;with the red hair. He had a lovely voice. He could sing, and he&#10;sang like a bird in the woodland. There was melody, and yet no&#10;melody.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;He must become a chorister boy,&#34; said his mother. &#34;He&#10;shall sing in the church, and stand among the beautiful gilded&#10;angels who are like him!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Fiery cat!&#34; said some of the witty ones of the&#10;town.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Drum heard that from the neighbors&#39; wives.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Don&#39;t go home, Peter,&#34; cried the street boys. &#34;If you&#10;sleep in the garret, there&#39;ll be a fire in the house, and the&#10;fire-drum will have to be beaten.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Look out for the drumsticks,&#34; replied Peter; and, small&#10;as he was, he ran up boldly, and gave the foremost such a punch in&#10;the body with his fist, that the fellow lost his legs and tumbled&#10;over, and the others took their legs off with themselves very&#10;rapidly.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The town musician was very genteel and fine. He was the&#10;son of the royal plate-washer. He was very fond of Peter, and would&#10;sometimes take him to his home; and he gave him a violin, and&#10;taught him to play it. It seemed as if the whole art lay in the&#10;boy&#39;s fingers; and he wanted to be more than a drummer&#8212;he wanted to&#10;become musician to the town.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I&#39;ll be a soldier,&#34; said Peter; for he was still quite a&#10;little lad, and it seemed to him the finest thing in the world to&#10;carry a gun, and to be able to march one, two&#8212;one, two, and to wear&#10;a uniform and a sword.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ah, you learn to long for the drum-skin, drum, dum, dum!&#34;&#10;said the Drum.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, if he could only march his way up to be a general!&#34;&#10;observed his father; &#34;but before he can do that, there must be&#10;war.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Heaven forbid!&#34; said his mother.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;We have nothing to lose,&#34; remarked the father.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, we have my boy,&#34; she retorted.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But suppose he came back a general!&#34; said the&#10;father.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Without arms and legs!&#34; cried the mother. &#34;No, I would&#10;rather keep my golden treasure with me.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Drum, dum, dum!&#34; The Fire-drum and all the other drums&#10;were beating, for war had come. The soldiers all set out, and the&#10;son of the drummer followed them. &#34;Red-head. Golden&#10;treasure!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The mother wept; the father in fancy saw him &#34;famous;&#34; the&#10;town musician was of opinion that he ought not to go to war, but&#10;should stay at home and learn music.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Red-head,&#34; said the soldiers, and little Peter laughed;&#10;but when one of them sometimes said to another, &#34;Foxey,&#34; he would&#10;bite his teeth together and look another way&#8212;into the wide world.&#10;He did not care for the nickname.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The boy was active, pleasant of speech, and good-humored;&#10;that is the best canteen, said his old comrades.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And many a night he had to sleep under the open sky, wet&#10;through with the driving rain or the falling mist; but his good&#10;humor never forsook him. The drum-sticks sounded, &#34;Rub-a-dub, all&#10;up, all up!&#34; Yes, he was certainly born to be a drummer.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The day of battle dawned. The sun had not yet risen, but&#10;the morning was come. The air was cold, the battle was hot; there&#10;was mist in the air, but still more gunpowder-smoke. The bullets&#10;and shells flew over the soldiers&#39; heads, and into their heads&#8212;into&#10;their bodies and limbs; but still they pressed forward. Here or&#10;there one or other of them would sink on his knees, with bleeding&#10;temples and a face as white as chalk. The little drummer still kept&#10;his healthy color; he had suffered no damage; he looked cheerfully&#10;at the dog of the regiment, which was jumping along as merrily as&#10;if the whole thing had been got up for his amusement, and as if the&#10;bullets were only flying about that he might have a game of play&#10;with them.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;March! Forward! March!&#34; This, was the word of command for&#10;the drum. The word had not yet been given to fall back, though they&#10;might have done so, and perhaps there would have been much sense in&#10;it; and now at last the word &#34;Retire&#34; was given; but our little&#10;drummer beat &#34;Forward! march!&#34; for he had understood the command&#10;thus, and the soldiers obeyed the sound of the drum. That was a&#10;good roll, and proved the summons to victory for the men, who had&#10;already begun to give way.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Life and limb were lost in the battle. Bombshells tore&#10;away the flesh in red strips; bombshells lit up into a terrible&#10;glow the strawheaps to which the wounded had dragged themselves, to&#10;lie untended for many hours, perhaps for all the hours they had to&#10;live.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It&#39;s no use thinking of it; and yet one cannot help&#10;thinking of it, even far away in the peaceful town. The drummer and&#10;his wife also thought of it, for Peter was at the war.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Now, I&#39;m tired of these complaints,&#34; said the&#10;Fire-drum.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Again the day of battle dawned; the sun had not yet risen,&#10;but it was morning. The drummer and his wife were asleep. They had&#10;been talking about their son, as, indeed, they did almost every&#10;night, for he was out yonder in God&#39;s hand. And the father dreamt&#10;that the war was over, that the soldiers had returned home, and&#10;that Peter wore a silver cross on his breast. But the mother dreamt&#10;that she had gone into the church, and had seen the painted&#10;pictures and the carved angels with the gilded hair, and her own&#10;dear boy, the golden treasure of her heart, who was standing among&#10;the angels in white robes, singing so sweetly, as surely only the&#10;angels can sing; and that he had soared up with them into the&#10;sunshine, and nodded so kindly at his mother.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;My golden treasure!&#34; she cried out; and she awoke. &#34;Now&#10;the good God has taken him to Himself!&#34; She folded her hands, and&#10;hid her face in the cotton curtains of the bed, and wept. &#34;Where&#10;does he rest now? among the many in the big grave that they have&#10;dug for the dead? Perhaps he&#39;s in the water in the marsh! Nobody&#10;knows his grave; no holy words have been read over it!&#34; And the&#10;Lord&#39;s Prayer went inaudibly over her lips; she bowed her head, and&#10;was so weary that she went to sleep.&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the days went by, in life as in dreams!&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was evening. Over the battle-field a rainbow spread,&#10;which touched the forest and the deep marsh.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It has been said, and is preserved in popular belief, that&#10;where the rainbow touches the earth a treasure lies buried, a&#10;golden treasure; and here there was one. No one but his mother&#10;thought of the little drummer, and therefore she dreamt of&#10;him.&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the days went by, in life as in dreams!&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Not a hair of his head had been hurt, not a golden&#10;hair.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Drum-ma-rum! drum-ma-rum! there he is!&#34; the Drum might&#10;have said, and his mother might have sung, if she had seen or&#10;dreamt it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;With hurrah and song, adorned with green wreaths of&#10;victory, they came home, as the war was at an end, and peace had&#10;been signed. The dog of the regiment sprang on in front with large&#10;bounds, and made the way three times as long for himself as it&#10;really was.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And days and weeks went by, and Peter came into his&#10;parents&#39; room. He was as brown as a wild man, and his eyes were&#10;bright, and his face beamed like sunshine. And his mother held him&#10;in her arms; she kissed his lips, his forehead, and his red hair.&#10;She had her boy back again; he had not a silver cross on his&#10;breast, as his father had dreamt, but he had sound limbs, a thing&#10;the mother had not dreamt. And what a rejoicing was there! They&#10;laughed and they wept; and Peter embraced the old&#10;Fire-drum.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;There stands the old skeleton still!&#34; he said.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the father beat a roll upon it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;One would think that a great fire had broken out here,&#34;&#10;said the Fire-drum. &#34;Bright day! fire in the heart! golden&#10;treasure! skrat! skr-r-at! skr-r-r-r-at!&#34;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And what then? What then!&#8212;Ask the town&#10;musician.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Peter&#39;s far outgrowing the drum,&#34; he said. &#34;Peter will be&#10;greater than I.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And yet he was the son of a royal plate-washer; but all&#10;that he had learned in half a lifetime, Peter learned in half a&#10;year.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;There was something so merry about him, something so truly&#10;kind-hearted. His eyes gleamed, and his hair gleamed too&#8212;there was&#10;no denying that!&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;He ought to have his hair dyed,&#34; said the neighbor&#39;s&#10;wife. &#34;That answered capitally with the policeman&#39;s daughter, and&#10;she got a husband.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But her hair turned as green as duckweed, and was always&#10;having to be colored up.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;She knows how to manage for herself,&#34; said the neighbors,&#10;&#34;and so can Peter. He comes to the most genteel houses, even to the&#10;burgomaster&#39;s where he gives Miss Charlotte piano-forte&#10;lessons.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;He could play! He could play, fresh out of his heart, the&#10;most charming pieces, that had never been put upon music-paper. He&#10;played in the bright nights, and in the dark nights, too. The&#10;neighbors declared it was unbearable, and the Fire-drum was of the&#10;same opinion.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;He played until his thoughts soared up, and burst forth in&#10;great plans for the future:&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;To be famous!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And burgomaster&#39;s Charlotte sat at the piano. Her delicate&#10;fingers danced over the keys, and made them ring into Peter&#39;s&#10;heart. It seemed too much for him to bear; and this happened not&#10;once, but many times; and at last one day he seized the delicate&#10;fingers and the white hand, and kissed it, and looked into her&#10;great brown eyes. Heaven knows what he said; but we may be allowed&#10;to guess at it. Charlotte blushed to guess at it. She reddened from&#10;brow to neck, and answered not a single word; and then strangers&#10;came into the room, and one of them was the state councillor&#39;s son.&#10;He had a lofty white forehead, and carried it so high that it&#10;seemed to go back into his neck. And Peter sat by her a long time,&#10;and she looked at him with gentle eyes.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;At home that evening he spoke of travel in the wide world,&#10;and of the golden treasure that lay hidden for him in his&#10;violin.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;To be famous!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Tum-me-lum, tum-me-lum, tum-me-lum!&#34; said the Fire-drum.&#10;&#34;Peter has gone clear out of his wits. I think there must be a fire&#10;in the house.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Next day the mother went to market.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Shall I tell you news, Peter?&#34; she asked when she came&#10;home. &#34;A capital piece of news. Burgomaster&#39;s Charlotte has engaged&#10;herself to the state councillor&#39;s son; the betrothal took place&#10;yesterday evening.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No!&#34; cried Peter, and he sprang up from his chair. But&#10;his mother persisted in saying &#34;Yes.&#34; She had heard it from the&#10;baker&#39;s wife, whose husband had it from the burgomaster&#39;s own&#10;mouth&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And Peter became as pale as death, and sat down&#10;again.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Good Heaven! what&#39;s the matter with you?&#34; asked his&#10;mother.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Nothing, nothing; only leave me to myself,&#34; he answered&#10;but the tears were running down his cheeks.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;My sweet child, my golden treasure!&#34; cried the mother,&#10;and she wept; but the Fire-drum sang, not out loud, but&#10;inwardly.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Charlotte&#39;s gone! Charlotte&#39;s gone! and now the song is&#10;done.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But the song was not done; there were many more verses in&#10;it, long verses, the most beautiful verses, the golden treasures of&#10;a life.&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;She behaves like a mad woman,&#34; said the neighbor&#39;s wife.&#10;&#34;All the world is to see the letters she gets from her golden&#10;treasure, and to read the words that are written in the papers&#10;about his violin playing. And he sends her money too, and that&#39;s&#10;very useful to her since she has been a widow.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;He plays before emperors and kings,&#34; said the town&#10;musician. &#34;I never had that fortune, but he&#39;s my pupil, and he does&#10;not forget his old master.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And his mother said,&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;His father dreamt that Peter came home from the war with&#10;a silver cross. He did not gain one in the war, but it is still&#10;more difficult to gain one in this way. Now he has the cross of&#10;honor. If his father had only lived to see it!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;He&#39;s grown famous!&#34; said the Fire-drum, and all his&#10;native town said the same thing, for the drummer&#39;s son, Peter with&#10;the red hair&#8212;Peter whom they had known as a little boy, running&#10;about in wooden shoes, and then as a drummer, playing for the&#10;dancers&#8212;was become famous!&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;He played at our house before he played in the presence&#10;of kings,&#34; said the burgomaster&#39;s wife. &#34;At that time he was quite&#10;smitten with Charlotte. He was always of an aspiring turn. At that&#10;time he was saucy and an enthusiast. My husband laughed when he&#10;heard of the foolish affair, and now our Charlotte is a state&#10;councillor&#39;s wife.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A golden treasure had been hidden in the heart and soul of&#10;the poor child, who had beaten the roll as a drummer&#8212;a roll of&#10;victory for those who had been ready to retreat. There was a golden&#10;treasure in his bosom, the power of sound; it burst forth on his&#10;violin as if the instrument had been a complete organ, and as if&#10;all the elves of a midsummer night were dancing across the strings.&#10;In its sounds were heard the piping of the thrush and the full&#10;clear note of the human voice; therefore the sound brought rapture&#10;to every heart, and carried his name triumphant through the land.&#10;That was a great firebrand&#8212;the firebrand of inspiration.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And then he looks so splendid!&#34; said the young ladies and&#10;the old ladies too; and the oldest of all procured an album for&#10;famous locks of hair, wholly and solely that she might beg a lock&#10;of his rich splendid hair, that treasure, that golden&#10;treasure.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the son came into the poor room of the drummer,&#10;elegant as a prince, happier than a king. His eyes were as clear&#10;and his face was as radiant as sunshine; and he held his mother in&#10;his arms, and she kissed his mouth, and wept as blissfully as any&#10;one can weep for joy; and he nodded at every old piece of furniture&#10;in the room, at the cupboard with the tea-cups, and at the&#10;flower-vase. He nodded at the sleeping-bench, where he had slept as&#10;a little boy; but the old Fire-drum he brought out, and dragged it&#10;into the middle of the room, and said to it and to his&#10;mother:&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;My father would have beaten a famous roll this evening.&#10;Now I must do it!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And he beat a thundering roll-call on the instrument, and&#10;the Drum felt so highly honored that the parchment burst with&#10;exultation.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;He has a splendid touch!&#34; said the Drum. &#34;I&#39;ve a&#10;remembrance of him now that will last. I expect that the same thing&#10;will happen to his mother, from pure joy over her golden&#10;treasure.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And this is the story of the Golden Treasure.&#10;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('A Beginning'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;IN a house in Copenhagen, not far from the king&#39;s new&#10;market, a very large party had assembled, the host and his family&#10;expecting, no doubt, to receive invitations in return. One half of&#10;the company were already seated at the card-tables, the other half&#10;seemed to be waiting the result of their hostess&#39;s question, &#34;Well,&#10;how shall we amuse ourselves?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Conversation followed, which, after a while, began to&#10;prove very entertaining. Among other subjects, it turned upon the&#10;events of the middle ages, which some persons maintained were more&#10;full of interest than our own times. Counsellor Knapp defended this&#10;opinion so warmly that the lady of the house immediately went over&#10;to his side, and both exclaimed against Oersted&#39;s Essays on Ancient&#10;and Modern Times, in which the preference is given to our own. The&#10;counsellor considered the times of the Danish king, Hans, as the&#10;noblest and happiest.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The conversation on this topic was only interrupted for a&#10;moment by the arrival of a newspaper, which did not, however,&#10;contain much worth reading, and while it is still going on we will&#10;pay a visit to the ante-room, in which cloaks, sticks, and goloshes&#10;were carefully placed. Here sat two maidens, one young, and the&#10;other old, as if they had come and were waiting to accompany their&#10;mistresses home; but on looking at them more closely, it could&#10;easily be seen that they were no common servants. Their shapes were&#10;too graceful, their complexions too delicate, and the cut of their&#10;dresses much too elegant. They were two fairies. The younger was&#10;not Fortune herself, but the chambermaid of one of Fortune&#39;s&#10;attendants, who carries about her more trifling gifts. The elder&#10;one, who was named Care, looked rather gloomy; she always goes&#10;about to perform her own business in person; for then she knows it&#10;is properly done. They were telling each other where they had been&#10;during the day. The messenger of Fortune had only transacted a few&#10;unimportant matters; for instance, she had preserved a new bonnet&#10;from a shower of rain, and obtained for an honest man a bow from a&#10;titled nobody, and so on; but she had something extraordinary to&#10;relate, after all.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I must tell you,&#34; said she, &#34;that to-day is my birthday;&#10;and in honor of it I have been intrusted with a pair of goloshes,&#10;to introduce amongst mankind. These goloshes have the property of&#10;making every one who puts them on imagine himself in any place he&#10;wishes, or that he exists at any period. Every wish is fulfilled at&#10;the moment it is expressed, so that for once mankind have the&#10;chance of being happy.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;No,&#34; replied Care; &#34;you may depend upon it that whoever&#10;puts on those goloshes will be very unhappy, and bless the moment&#10;in which he can get rid of them.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What are you thinking of?&#34; replied the other. &#34;Now see; I&#10;will place them by the door; some one will take them instead of his&#10;own, and he will be the happy man.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;This was the end of their conversation.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('What Happened to the Counsellor'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;IT was late when Counsellor Knapp, lost in thought about&#10;the times of King Hans, desired to return home; and fate so ordered&#10;it that he put on the goloshes of Fortune instead of his own, and&#10;walked out into the East Street. Through the magic power of the&#10;goloshes, he was at once carried back three hundred years, to the&#10;times of King Hans, for which he had been longing when he put them&#10;on. Therefore he immediately set his foot into the mud and mire of&#10;the street, which in those days possessed no pavement.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Why, this is horrible; how dreadfully dirty it is!&#34; said&#10;the counsellor; and the whole pavement has vanished, and the lamps&#10;are all out.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The moon had not yet risen high enough to penetrate the&#10;thick foggy air, and all the objects around him were confused&#10;together in the darkness. At the nearest corner, a lamp hung before&#10;a picture of the Madonna; but the light it gave was almost useless,&#10;for he only perceived it when he came quite close and his eyes fell&#10;on the painted figures of the Mother and Child.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That is most likely a museum of art,&#34; thought he, &#34;and&#10;they have forgotten to take down the sign.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Two men, in the dress of olden times, passed by&#10;him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What odd figures!&#34; thought he; &#34;they must be returning&#10;from some masquerade.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Suddenly he heard the sound of a drum and fifes, and then&#10;a blazing light from torches shone upon him. The counsellor stared&#10;with astonishment as he beheld a most strange procession pass&#10;before him. First came a whole troop of drummers, beating their&#10;drums very cleverly; they were followed by life-guards, with&#10;longbows and crossbows. The principal person in the procession was&#10;a clerical-looking gentleman. The astonished counsellor asked what&#10;it all meant, and who the gentleman might be.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That is the bishop of Zealand.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Good gracious!&#34; he exclaimed; &#34;what in the world has&#10;happened to the bishop? what can he be thinking about?&#34; Then he&#10;shook his head and said, &#34;It cannot possibly be the bishop&#10;himself.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;While musing on this strange affair, and without looking&#10;to the right or left, he walked on through East Street and over&#10;Highbridge Place. The bridge, which he supposed led to Palace&#10;Square, was nowhere to be found; but instead, he saw a bank and&#10;some shallow water, and two people, who sat in a boat.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Does the gentleman wish to be ferried over the Holm?&#34;&#10;asked one.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;To the Holm!&#34; exclaimed the counsellor, not knowing in&#10;what age he was now existing; &#34;I want to go to Christian&#39;s Haven,&#10;in Little Turf Street.&#34; The men stared at him. &#34;Pray tell me where&#10;the bridge is!&#34; said he. &#34;It is shameful that the lamps are not&#10;lighted here, and it is as muddy as if one were walking in a&#10;marsh.&#34; But the more he talked with the boatmen the less they could&#10;understand each other.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I don&#39;t understand your outlandish talk,&#34; he cried at&#10;last, angrily turning his back upon them. He could not, however,&#10;find the bridge nor any railings.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What a scandalous condition this place is in,&#34; said he;&#10;never, certainly, had he found his own times so miserable as on&#10;this evening. &#34;I think it will be better for me to take a coach;&#10;but where are they?&#34; There was not one to be seen! &#34;I shall be&#10;obliged to go back to the king&#39;s new market,&#34; said he, &#34;where there&#10;are plenty of carriages standing, or I shall never reach&#10;Christian&#39;s Haven.&#34; Then he went towards East Street, and had&#10;nearly passed through it, when the moon burst forth from a&#10;cloud.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Dear me, what have they been erecting here?&#34; he cried, as&#10;he caught sight of the East gate, which in olden times used to&#10;stand at the end of East Street. However, he found an opening&#10;through which he passed, and came out upon where he expected to&#10;find the new market. Nothing was to be seen but an open meadow,&#10;surrounded by a few bushes, through which ran a broad canal or&#10;stream. A few miserable-looking wooden booths, for the&#10;accommodation of Dutch watermen, stood on the opposite&#10;shore.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Either I behold a fata morgana, or I must be tipsy,&#34;&#10;groaned the counsellor. &#34;What can it be? What is the matter with&#10;me?&#34; He turned back in the full conviction that he must be ill. In&#10;walking through the street this time, he examined the houses more&#10;closely; he found that most of them were built of lath and plaster,&#10;and many had only a thatched roof.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I am certainly all wrong,&#34; said he, with a sigh; and yet&#10;I only drank one glass of punch. But I cannot bear even that, and&#10;it was very foolish to give us punch and hot salmon; I shall speak&#10;about it to our hostess, the agent&#39;s lady. Suppose I were to go&#10;back now and say how ill I feel, I fear it would look so&#10;ridiculous, and it is not very likely that I should find any one&#10;up.&#34; Then he looked for the house, but it was not in&#10;existence.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;This is really frightful; I cannot even recognize East&#10;Street. Not a shop to be seen; nothing but old, wretched,&#10;tumble-down houses, just as if I were at Roeskilde or Ringstedt.&#10;Oh, I really must be ill! It is no use to stand upon ceremony. But&#10;where in the world is the agent&#39;s house. There is a house, but it&#10;is not his; and people still up in it, I can hear. Oh dear! I&#10;certainly am very queer.&#34; As he reached the half-open door, he saw&#10;a light and went in. It was a tavern of the olden times, and seemed&#10;a kind of beershop. The room had the appearance of a Dutch&#10;interior. A number of people, consisting of seamen, Copenhagen&#10;citizens, and a few scholars, sat in deep conversation over their&#10;mugs, and took very little notice of the new comer.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Pardon me,&#34; said the counsellor, addressing the landlady,&#10;&#34;I do not feel quite well, and I should be much obliged if you will&#10;send for a fly to take me to Christian&#39;s Haven.&#34; The woman stared&#10;at him and shook her head. Then she spoke to him in German. The&#10;counsellor supposed from this that she did not understand Danish;&#10;he therefore repeated his request in German. This, as well as his&#10;singular dress, convinced the woman that he was a foreigner. She&#10;soon understood, however, that he did not find himself quite well,&#10;and therefore brought him a mug of water. It had something of the&#10;taste of seawater, certainly, although it had been drawn from the&#10;well outside. Then the counsellor leaned his head on his hand, drew&#10;a deep breath, and pondered over all the strange things that had&#10;happened to him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Is that to-day&#39;s number of the Day?&#34; he asked, quite&#10;mechanically, as he saw the woman putting by a large piece of&#10;paper. She did not understand what he meant, but she handed him the&#10;sheet; it was a woodcut, representing a meteor, which had appeared&#10;in the town of Cologne.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That is very old,&#34; said the counsellor, becoming quite&#10;cheerful at the sight of this antique drawing. &#34;Where did you get&#10;this singular sheet? It is very interesting, although the whole&#10;affair is a fable. Meteors are easily explained in these days; they&#10;are northern lights, which are often seen, and are no doubt caused&#10;by electricity.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Those who sat near him, and heard what he said, looked at&#10;him in great astonishment, and one of them rose, took off his hat&#10;respectfully, and said in a very serious manner, &#34;You must&#10;certainly be a very learned man, monsieur.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh no,&#34; replied the counsellor; &#34;I can only discourse on&#10;topics which every one should understand.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Modestia is a beautiful virtue,&#34; said the man. &#34;Moreover,&#10;I must add to your speech mihi secus videtur; yet in this case I&#10;would suspend my judicium.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;May I ask to whom I have the pleasure of&#10;speaking?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I am a Bachelor of Divinity,&#34; said the man. This answer&#10;satisfied the counsellor. The title agreed with the&#10;dress.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;This is surely,&#34; thought he, &#34;an old village&#10;schoolmaster, a perfect original, such as one meets with sometimes&#10;even in Jutland.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;This is not certainly a locus docendi,&#34; began the man;&#10;&#34;still I must beg you to continue the conversation. You must be&#10;well read in ancient lore.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh yes,&#34; replied the counsellor; &#34;I am very fond of&#10;reading useful old books, and modern ones as well, with the&#10;exception of every-day stories, of which we really have more than&#10;enough.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Every-day stories?&#34; asked the bachelor.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, I mean the new novels that we have at the present&#10;day.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh,&#34; replied the man, with a smile; &#34;and yet they are&#10;very witty, and are much read at Court. The king likes especially&#10;the romance of Messeurs Iffven and Gaudian, which describes King&#10;Arthur and his knights of the round table. He has joked about it&#10;with the gentlemen of his Court.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Well, I have certainly not read that,&#34; replied the&#10;counsellor. &#34;I suppose it is quite new, and published by&#10;Heiberg.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No,&#34; answered the man, &#34;it is not by Heiberg; Godfred von&#10;Gehman brought it out.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, is he the publisher? That is a very old name,&#34; said&#10;the counsellor; &#34;was it not the name of the first publisher in&#10;Denmark?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes; and he is our first printer and publisher now,&#34;&#10;replied the scholar.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;So far all had passed off very well; but now one of the&#10;citizens began to speak of a terrible pestilence which had been&#10;raging a few years before, meaning the plague of 1484. The&#10;counsellor thought he referred to the cholera, and they could&#10;discuss this without finding out the mistake. The war in 1490 was&#10;spoken of as quite recent. The English pirates had taken some ships&#10;in the Channel in 1801, and the counsellor, supposing they referred&#10;to these, agreed with them in finding fault with the English. The&#10;rest of the talk, however, was not so agreeable; every moment one&#10;contradicted the other. The good bachelor appeared very ignorant,&#10;for the simplest remark of the counsellor seemed to him either too&#10;bold or too fantastic. They stared at each other, and when it&#10;became worse the bachelor spoke in Latin, in the hope of being&#10;better understood; but it was all useless.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;How are you now?&#34; asked the landlady, pulling the&#10;counsellor&#39;s sleeve.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then his recollection returned to him. In the course of&#10;conversation he had forgotten all that had happened&#10;previously.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Goodness me! where am I?&#34; said he. It bewildered him as&#10;he thought of it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;We will have some claret, or mead, or Bremen beer,&#34; said&#10;one of the guests; &#34;will you drink with us?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Two maids came in. One of them had a cap on her head of&#10;two colors. They poured out the wine, bowed their heads, and&#10;withdrew.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The counsellor felt a cold shiver run all over him. &#34;What&#10;is this? what does it mean?&#34; said he; but he was obliged to drink&#10;with them, for they overpowered the good man with their politeness.&#10;He became at last desperate; and when one of them said he was&#10;tipsy, he did not doubt the man&#39;s word in the least&#8212;only begged&#10;them to get a droschky; and then they thought he was speaking the&#10;Muscovite language. Never before had he been in such rough and&#10;vulgar company. &#34;One might believe that the country was going back&#10;to heathenism,&#34; he observed. &#34;This is the most terrible moment of&#10;my life.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Just then it came into his mind that he would stoop under&#10;the table, and so creep to the door. He tried it; but before he&#10;reached the entry, the rest discovered what he was about, and&#10;seized him by the feet, when, luckily for him, off came the&#10;goloshes, and with them vanished the whole enchantment. The&#10;counsellor now saw quite plainly a lamp, and a large building&#10;behind it; everything looked familiar and beautiful. He was in East&#10;Street, as it now appears; he lay with his legs turned towards a&#10;porch, and just by him sat the watchman asleep.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Is it possible that I have been lying here in the street&#10;dreaming?&#34; said he. &#34;Yes, this is East Street; how beautifully&#10;bright and gay it looks! It is quite shocking that one glass of&#10;punch should have upset me like this.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Two minutes afterwards he sat in a droschky, which was to&#10;drive him to Christian&#39;s Haven. He thought of all the terror and&#10;anxiety which he had undergone, and felt thankful from his heart&#10;for the reality and comfort of modern times, which, with all their&#10;errors, were far better than those in which he so lately found&#10;himself.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('The Watchman&#39;s Adventures'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Well, I declare, there lies a pair of goloshes,&#34; said the&#10;watchman. &#34;No doubt, they belong to the lieutenant who lives up&#10;stairs. They are lying just by his door.&#34; Gladly would the honest&#10;man have rung, and given them in, for a light was still burning,&#10;but he did not wish to disturb the other people in the house; so he&#10;let them lie. &#34;These things must keep the feet very warm,&#34; said he;&#10;&#34;they are of such nice soft leather.&#34; Then he tried them on, and&#10;they fitted his feet exactly. &#34;Now,&#34; said he, &#34;how droll things are&#10;in this world! There&#39;s that man can lie down in his warm bed, but&#10;he does not do so. There he goes pacing up and down the room. He&#10;ought to be a happy man. He has neither wife nor children, and he&#10;goes out into company every evening. Oh, I wish I were he; then I&#10;should be a happy man.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;As he uttered this wish, the goloshes which he had put on&#10;took effect, and the watchman at once became the lieutenant. There&#10;he stood in his room, holding a little piece of pink paper between&#10;his fingers, on which was a poem,&#8212;a poem written by the lieutenant&#10;himself. Who has not had, for once in his life, a moment of poetic&#10;inspiration? and at such a moment, if the thoughts are written&#10;down, they flow in poetry. The following verses were written on the&#10;pink paper:&#8212;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;OH WERE I RICH!&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh were I rich! How oft, in youth&#39;s bright hour,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;When youthful pleasures banish every care,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;I longed for riches but to gain a power,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;The sword and plume and uniform to wear!&#60;br /&#62;&#10;The riches and the honor came for me;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Yet still my greatest wealth was poverty:&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Ah, help and pity me!&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#34;Once in my youthful hours, when gay and free,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;A maiden loved me; and her gentle kiss,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Rich in its tender love and purity,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Taught me, alas! too much of earthly bliss.&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Dear child! She only thought of youthful glee;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;She loved no wealth, but fairy tales and me.&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Thou knowest: ah, pity me!&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh were I rich! again is all my prayer:&#60;br /&#62;&#10;That child is now a woman, fair and free,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;As good and beautiful as angels are.&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Oh, were I rich in lovers&#39; poetry,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;To tell my fairy tale, love&#39;s richest lore!&#60;br /&#62;&#10;But no; I must be silent&#8212;I am poor.&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Ah, wilt thou pity me?&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh were I rich in truth and peace below,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;I need not then my poverty bewail.&#60;br /&#62;&#10;To thee I dedicate these lines of woe;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Wilt thou not understand the mournful tale?&#60;br /&#62;&#10;A leaf on which my sorrows I relate-&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Dark story of a darker night of fate.&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Ah, bless and pity me!&#34;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Well, yes; people write poems when they are in love, but&#10;a wise man will not print them. A lieutenant in love, and poor.&#10;This is a triangle, or more properly speaking, the half of the&#10;broken die of fortune.&#34; The lieutenant felt this very keenly, and&#10;therefore leaned his head against the window-frame, and sighed&#10;deeply. &#34;The poor watchman in the street,&#34; said he, &#34;is far happier&#10;than I am. He knows not what I call poverty. He has a home, a wife&#10;and children, who weep at his sorrow and rejoice at his joy. Oh,&#10;how much happier I should be could I change my being and position&#10;with him, and pass through life with his humble expectations and&#10;hopes! Yes, he is indeed happier than I am.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;At this moment the watchman again became a watchman; for&#10;having, through the goloshes of Fortune, passed into the existence&#10;of the lieutenant, and found himself less contented than he&#10;expected, he had preferred his former condition, and wished himself&#10;again a watchman. &#34;That was an ugly dream,&#34; said he, &#34;but droll&#10;enough. It seemed to me as if I were the lieutenant up yonder, but&#10;there was no happiness for me. I missed my wife and the little&#10;ones, who are always ready to smother me with kisses.&#34; He sat down&#10;again and nodded, but he could not get the dream out of his&#10;thoughts, and he still had the goloshes on his feet. A falling star&#10;gleamed across the sky. &#34;There goes one!&#34; cried he. &#34;However, there&#10;are quite enough left; I should very much like to examine these a&#10;little nearer, especially the moon, for that could not slip away&#10;under one&#39;s hands. The student, for whom my wife washes, says that&#10;when we die we shall fly from one star to another. If that were&#10;true, it would be very delightful, but I don&#39;t believe it. I wish I&#10;could make a little spring up there now; I would willingly let my&#10;body lie here on the steps.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;There are certain things in the world which should be&#10;uttered very cautiously; doubly so when the speaker has on his feet&#10;the goloshes of Fortune. Now we shall hear what happened to the&#10;watchman.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Nearly every one is acquainted with the great power of&#10;steam; we have proved it by the rapidity with which we can travel,&#10;both on a railroad or in a steamship across the sea. But this speed&#10;is like the movements of the sloth, or the crawling march of the&#10;snail, when compared to the swiftness with which light travels;&#10;light flies nineteen million times faster than the fleetest&#10;race-horse, and electricity is more rapid still. Death is an&#10;electric shock which we receive in our hearts, and on the wings of&#10;electricity the liberated soul flies away swiftly, the light from&#10;the sun travels to our earth ninety-five millions of miles in eight&#10;minutes and a few seconds; but on the wings of electricity, the&#10;mind requires only a second to accomplish the same distance. The&#10;space between the heavenly bodies is, to thought, no farther than&#10;the distance which we may have to walk from one friend&#39;s house to&#10;another in the same town; yet this electric shock obliges us to use&#10;our bodies here below, unless, like the watchman, we have on the&#10;goloshes of Fortune.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In a very few seconds the watchman had travelled more than&#10;two hundred thousand miles to the moon, which is formed of a&#10;lighter material than our earth, and may be said to be as soft as&#10;new fallen snow. He found himself on one of the circular range of&#10;mountains which we see represented in Dr. Madler&#39;s large map of the&#10;moon. The interior had the appearance of a large hollow,&#10;bowl-shaped, with a depth about half a mile from the brim. Within&#10;this hollow stood a large town; we may form some idea of its&#10;appearance by pouring the white of an egg into a glass of water.&#10;The materials of which it was built seemed just as soft, and&#10;pictured forth cloudy turrets and sail-like terraces, quite&#10;transparent, and floating in the thin air. Our earth hung over his&#10;head like a great dark red ball. Presently he discovered a number&#10;of beings, which might certainly be called men, but were very&#10;different to ourselves. A more fantastical imagination than&#10;Herschel&#39;s must have discovered these. Had they been placed in&#10;groups, and painted, it might have been said, &#34;What beautiful&#10;foliage!&#34; They had also a language of their own. No one could have&#10;expected the soul of the watchman to understand it, and yet he did&#10;understand it, for our souls have much greater capabilities then we&#10;are inclined to believe. Do we not, in our dreams, show a wonderful&#10;dramatic talent? each of our acquaintance appears to us then in his&#10;own character, and with his own voice; no man could thus imitate&#10;them in his waking hours. How clearly, too, we are reminded of&#10;persons whom we have not seen for many years; they start up&#10;suddenly to the mind&#39;s eye with all their peculiarities as living&#10;realities. In fact, this memory of the soul is a fearful thing;&#10;every sin, every sinful thought it can bring back, and we may well&#10;ask how we are to give account of &#34;every idle word&#34; that may have&#10;been whispered in the heart or uttered with the lips. The spirit of&#10;the watchman therefore understood very well the language of the&#10;inhabitants of the moon. They were disputing about our earth, and&#10;doubted whether it could be inhabited. The atmosphere, they&#10;asserted, must be too dense for any inhabitants of the moon to&#10;exist there. They maintained that the moon alone was inhabited, and&#10;was really the heavenly body in which the old world people lived.&#10;They likewise talked politics.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But now we will descend to East Street, and see what&#10;happened to the watchman&#39;s body. He sat lifeless on the steps. His&#10;staff had fallen out of his hand, and his eyes stared at the moon,&#10;about which his honest soul was wandering.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What is it o&#39;clock, watchman?&#34; inquired a passenger. But&#10;there was no answer from the watchman.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The man then pulled his nose gently, which caused him to&#10;lose his balance. The body fell forward, and lay at full length on&#10;the ground as one dead.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;All his comrades were very much frightened, for he seemed&#10;quite dead; still they allowed him to remain after they had given&#10;notice of what had happened; and at dawn the body was carried to&#10;the hospital. We might imagine it to be no jesting matter if the&#10;soul of the man should chance to return to him, for most probably&#10;it would seek for the body in East Street without being able to&#10;find it. We might fancy the soul inquiring of the police, or at the&#10;address office, or among the missing parcels, and then at length&#10;finding it at the hospital. But we may comfort ourselves by the&#10;certainty that the soul, when acting upon its own impulses, is&#10;wiser than we are; it is the body that makes it stupid.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;As we have said, the watchman&#39;s body had been taken to the&#10;hospital, and here it was placed in a room to be washed. Naturally,&#10;the first thing done here was to take off the goloshes, upon which&#10;the soul was instantly obliged to return, and it took the direct&#10;road to the body at once, and in a few seconds the man&#39;s life&#10;returned to him. He declared, when he quite recovered himself, that&#10;this had been the most dreadful night he had ever passed; not for a&#10;hundred pounds would he go through such feelings again. However, it&#10;was all over now.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The same day he was allowed to leave, but the goloshes&#10;remained at the hospital.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('The Eventual Moment&#8212;A Most Unusual&#10;Journey'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Every inhabitant of Copenhagen knows what the entrance to&#10;Frederick&#39;s Hospital is like; but as most probably a few of those&#10;who read this little tale may not reside in Copenhagen, we will&#10;give a short description of it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The hospital is separated from the street by an iron&#10;railing, in which the bars stand so wide apart that, it is said,&#10;some very slim patients have squeezed through, and gone to pay&#10;little visits in the town. The most difficult part of the body to&#10;get through was the head; and in this case, as it often happens in&#10;the world, the small heads were the most fortunate. This will serve&#10;as sufficient introduction to our tale. One of the young&#10;volunteers, of whom, physically speaking, it might be said that he&#10;had a great head, was on guard that evening at the hospital. The&#10;rain was pouring down, yet, in spite of these two obstacles, he&#10;wanted to go out just for a quarter of an hour; it was not worth&#10;while, he thought, to make a confidant of the porter, as he could&#10;easily slip through the iron railings. There lay the goloshes,&#10;which the watchman had forgotten. It never occurred to him that&#10;these could be goloshes of Fortune. They would be very serviceable&#10;to him in this rainy weather, so he drew them on. Now came the&#10;question whether he could squeeze through the palings; he certainly&#10;had never tried, so he stood looking at them. &#34;I wish to goodness&#10;my head was through,&#34; said he, and instantly, though it was so&#10;thick and large, it slipped through quite easily. The goloshes&#10;answered that purpose very well, but his body had to follow, and&#10;this was impossible. &#34;I am too fat,&#34; he said; &#34;I thought my head&#10;would be the worst, but I cannot get my body through, that is&#10;certain.&#34; Then he tried to pull his head back again, but without&#10;success; he could move his neck about easily enough, and that was&#10;all. His first feeling was one of anger, and then his spirits sank&#10;below zero. The goloshes of Fortune had placed him in this terrible&#10;position, and unfortunately it never occurred to him to wish&#10;himself free. No, instead of wishing he kept twisting about, yet&#10;did not stir from the spot. The rain poured, and not a creature&#10;could be seen in the street. The porter&#39;s bell he was unable to&#10;reach, and however was he to get loose! He foresaw that he should&#10;have to stay there till morning, and then they must send for a&#10;smith to file away the iron bars, and that would be a work of time.&#10;All the charity children would just be going to school: and all the&#10;sailors who inhabited that quarter of the town would be there to&#10;see him standing in the pillory. What a crowd there would be. &#34;Ha,&#34;&#10;he cried, &#34;the blood is rushing to my head, and I shall go mad. I&#10;believe I am crazy already; oh, I wish I were free, then all these&#10;sensations would pass off.&#34; This is just what he ought to have said&#10;at first. The moment he had expressed the thought his head was&#10;free. He started back, quite bewildered with the fright which the&#10;goloshes of Fortune had caused him. But we must not suppose it was&#10;all over; no, indeed, there was worse to come yet. The night&#10;passed, and the whole of the following day; but no one sent for the&#10;goloshes. In the evening a declamatory performance was to take&#10;place at the amateur theatre in a distant street. The house was&#10;crowded; among the audience was the young volunteer from the&#10;hospital, who seemed to have quite forgotten his adventures of the&#10;previous evening. He had on the goloshes; they had not been sent&#10;for, and as the streets were still very dirty, they were of great&#10;service to him. A new poem, entitled &#34;My Aunt&#39;s Spectacles,&#34; was&#10;being recited. It described these spectacles as possessing a&#10;wonderful power; if any one put them on in a large assembly the&#10;people appeared like cards, and the future events of ensuing years&#10;could be easily foretold by them. The idea struck him that he&#10;should very much like to have such a pair of spectacles; for, if&#10;used rightly, they would perhaps enable him to see into the hearts&#10;of people, which he thought would be more interesting than to know&#10;what was going to happen next year; for future events would be sure&#10;to show themselves, but the hearts of people never. &#34;I can fancy&#10;what I should see in the whole row of ladies and gentlemen on the&#10;first seat, if I could only look into their hearts; that lady, I&#10;imagine, keeps a store for things of all descriptions; how my eyes&#10;would wander about in that collection; with many ladies I should no&#10;doubt find a large millinery establishment. There is another that&#10;is perhaps empty, and would be all the better for cleaning out.&#10;There may be some well stored with good articles. Ah, yes,&#34; he&#10;sighed, &#34;I know one, in which everything is solid, but a servant is&#10;there already, and that is the only thing against it. I dare say&#10;from many I should hear the words, &#39;Please to walk in.&#39; I only wish&#10;I could slip into the hearts like a little tiny thought.&#34; This was&#10;the word of command for the goloshes. The volunteer shrunk up&#10;together, and commenced a most unusual journey through the hearts&#10;of the spectators in the first row. The first heart he entered was&#10;that of a lady, but he thought he must have got into one of the&#10;rooms of an orthopedic institution where plaster casts of deformed&#10;limbs were hanging on the walls, with this difference, that the&#10;casts in the institution are formed when the patient enters, but&#10;here they were formed and preserved after the good people had left.&#10;These were casts of the bodily and mental deformities of the lady&#39;s&#10;female friends carefully preserved. Quickly he passed into another&#10;heart, which had the appearance of a spacious, holy church, with&#10;the white dove of innocence fluttering over the altar. Gladly would&#10;he have fallen on his knees in such a sacred place; but he was&#10;carried on to another heart, still, however, listening to the tones&#10;of the organ, and feeling himself that he had become another and a&#10;better man. The next heart was also a sanctuary, which he felt&#10;almost unworthy to enter; it represented a mean garret, in which&#10;lay a sick mother; but the warm sunshine streamed through the&#10;window, lovely roses bloomed in a little flowerbox on the roof, two&#10;blue birds sang of childlike joys, and the sick mother prayed for a&#10;blessing on her daughter. Next he crept on his hands and knees&#10;through an overfilled butcher&#39;s shop; there was meat, nothing but&#10;meat, wherever he stepped; this was the heart of a rich,&#10;respectable man, whose name is doubtless in the directory. Then he&#10;entered the heart of this man&#39;s wife; it was an old, tumble-down&#10;pigeon-house; the husband&#39;s portrait served as a weather-cock; it&#10;was connected with all the doors, which opened and shut just as the&#10;husband&#39;s decision turned. The next heart was a complete cabinet of&#10;mirrors, such as can be seen in the Castle of Rosenberg. But these&#10;mirrors magnified in an astonishing degree; in the middle of the&#10;floor sat, like the Grand Lama, the insignificant I of the owner,&#10;astonished at the contemplation of his own features. At his next&#10;visit he fancied he must have got into a narrow needlecase, full of&#10;sharp needles: &#34;Oh,&#34; thought he, &#34;this must be the heart of an old&#10;maid;&#34; but such was not the fact; it belonged to a young officer,&#10;who wore several orders, and was said to be a man of intellect and&#10;heart.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The poor volunteer came out of the last heart in the row&#10;quite bewildered. He could not collect his thoughts, and imagined&#10;his foolish fancies had carried him away. &#34;Good gracious!&#34; he&#10;sighed, &#34;I must have a tendency to softening of the brain, and here&#10;it is so exceedingly hot that the blood is rushing to my head.&#34; And&#10;then suddenly recurred to him the strange event of the evening&#10;before, when his head had been fixed between the iron railings in&#10;front of the hospital. &#34;That is the cause of it all!&#34; he exclaimed,&#10;&#34;I must do something in time. A Russian bath would be a very good&#10;thing to begin with. I wish I were lying on one of the highest&#10;shelves.&#34; Sure enough, there he lay on an upper shelf of a vapor&#10;bath, still in his evening costume, with his boots and goloshes on,&#10;and the hot drops from the ceiling falling on his face. &#34;Ho!&#34; he&#10;cried, jumping down and rushing towards the plunging bath. The&#10;attendant stopped him with a loud cry, when he saw a man with all&#10;his clothes on. The volunteer had, however, presence of mind enough&#10;to whisper, &#34;It is for a wager;&#34; but the first thing he did, when&#10;he reached his own room, was to put a large blister on his neck,&#10;and another on his back, that his crazy fit might be cured. The&#10;next morning his back was very sore, which was all he gained by the&#10;goloshes of Fortune.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('The Clerk&#39;s Transformation'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The watchman, whom we of course have not forgotten,&#10;thought, after a while, of the goloshes which he had found and&#10;taken to the hospital; so he went and fetched them. But neither the&#10;lieutenant nor any one in the street could recognize them as their&#10;own, so he gave them up to the police. &#34;They look exactly like my&#10;own goloshes,&#34; said one of the clerks, examining the unknown&#10;articles, as they stood by the side of his own. &#34;It would require&#10;even more than the eye of a shoemaker to know one pair from the&#10;other.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Master clerk,&#34; said a servant who entered with some&#10;papers. The clerk turned and spoke to the man; but when he had done&#10;with him, he turned to look at the goloshes again, and now he was&#10;in greater doubt than ever as to whether the pair on the right or&#10;on the left belonged to him. &#34;Those that are wet must be mine,&#34;&#10;thought he; but he thought wrong, it was just the reverse. The&#10;goloshes of Fortune were the wet pair; and, besides, why should not&#10;a clerk in a police office be wrong sometimes? So he drew them on,&#10;thrust his papers into his pocket, placed a few manuscripts under&#10;his arm, which he had to take with him, and to make abstracts from&#10;at home. Then, as it was Sunday morning and the weather very fine,&#10;he said to himself, &#34;A walk to Fredericksburg will do me good:&#34; so&#10;away he went.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;There could not be a quieter or more steady young man than&#10;this clerk. We will not grudge him this little walk, it was just&#10;the thing to do him good after sitting so much. He went on at first&#10;like a mere automaton, without thought or wish; therefore the&#10;goloshes had no opportunity to display their magic power. In the&#10;avenue he met with an acquaintance, one of our young poets, who&#10;told him that he intended to start on the following day on a summer&#10;excursion. &#34;Are you really going away so soon?&#34; asked the clerk.&#10;&#34;What a free, happy man you are. You can roam about where you will,&#10;while such as we are tied by the foot.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But it is fastened to the bread-tree,&#34; replied the poet.&#10;&#34;You need have no anxiety for the morrow; and when you are old&#10;there is a pension for you.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ah, yes; but you have the best of it,&#34; said the clerk;&#10;&#34;it must be so delightful to sit and write poetry. The whole world&#10;makes itself agreeable to you, and then you are your own master.&#10;You should try how you would like to listen to all the trivial&#10;things in a court of justice.&#34; The poet shook his head, so also did&#10;the clerk; each retained his own opinion, and so they parted. &#34;They&#10;are strange people, these poets,&#34; thought the clerk. &#34;I should like&#10;to try what it is to have a poetic taste, and to become a poet&#10;myself. I am sure I should not write such mournful verses as they&#10;do. This is a splendid spring day for a poet, the air is so&#10;remarkably clear, the clouds are so beautiful, and the green grass&#10;has such a sweet smell. For many years I have not felt as I do at&#10;this moment.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;We perceive, by these remarks, that he had already become&#10;a poet. By most poets what he had said would be considered&#10;common-place, or as the Germans call it, &#34;insipid.&#34; It is a foolish&#10;fancy to look upon poets as different to other men. There are many&#10;who are more the poets of nature than those who are professed&#10;poets. The difference is this, the poet&#39;s intellectual memory is&#10;better; he seizes upon an idea or a sentiment, until he can embody&#10;it, clearly and plainly in words, which the others cannot do. But&#10;the transition from a character of every-day life to one of a more&#10;gifted nature is a great transition; and so the clerk became aware&#10;of the change after a time. &#34;What a delightful perfume,&#34; said he;&#10;&#34;it reminds me of the violets at Aunt Lora&#39;s. Ah, that was when I&#10;was a little boy. Dear me, how long it seems since I thought of&#10;those days! She was a good old maiden lady! she lived yonder,&#10;behind the Exchange. She always had a sprig or a few blossoms in&#10;water, let the winter be ever so severe. I could smell the violets,&#10;even while I was placing warm penny pieces against the frozen panes&#10;to make peep-holes, and a pretty view it was on which I peeped. Out&#10;in the river lay the ships, icebound, and forsaken by their crews;&#10;a screaming crow represented the only living creature on board. But&#10;when the breezes of spring came, everything started into life.&#10;Amidst shouting and cheers the ships were tarred and rigged, and&#10;then they sailed to foreign lands.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I remain here, and always shall remain, sitting at my&#10;post at the police office, and letting others take passports to&#10;distant lands. Yes, this is my fate,&#34; and he sighed deeply.&#10;Suddenly he paused. &#34;Good gracious, what has come over me? I never&#10;felt before as I do now; it must be the air of spring. It is&#10;overpowering, and yet it is delightful.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;He felt in his pockets for some of his papers. &#34;These will&#10;give me something else to think of,&#34; said he. Casting his eyes on&#10;the first page of one, he read, &#34;&#39;Mistress Sigbirth; an original&#10;Tragedy, in Five Acts.&#39; What is this?&#8212;in my own handwriting, too!&#10;Have I written this tragedy?&#34; He read again, &#34;&#39;The Intrigue on the&#10;Promenade; or, the Fast-Day. A Vaudeville.&#39; However did I get all&#10;this? Some one must have put them into my pocket. And here is a&#10;letter!&#34; It was from the manager of a theatre; the pieces were&#10;rejected, not at all in polite terms.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Hem, hem!&#34; said he, sitting down on a bench; his thoughts&#10;were very elastic, and his heart softened strangely. Involuntarily&#10;he seized one of the nearest flowers; it was a little, simple&#10;daisy. All that botanists can say in many lectures was explained in&#10;a moment by this little flower. It spoke of the glory of its birth;&#10;it told of the strength of the sunlight, which had caused its&#10;delicate leaves to expand, and given to it such sweet perfume. The&#10;struggles of life which arouse sensations in the bosom have their&#10;type in the tiny flowers. Air and light are the lovers of the&#10;flowers, but light is the favored one; towards light it turns, and&#10;only when light vanishes does it fold its leaves together, and&#10;sleep in the embraces of the air.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It is light that adorns me,&#34; said the flower.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But the air gives you the breath of life,&#34; whispered the&#10;poet.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Just by him stood a boy, splashing with his stick in a&#10;marshy ditch. The water-drops spurted up among the green twigs, and&#10;the clerk thought of the millions of animalculae which were thrown&#10;into the air with every drop of water, at a height which must be&#10;the same to them as it would be to us if we were hurled beyond the&#10;clouds. As the clerk thought of all these things, and became&#10;conscious of the great change in his own feelings, he smiled, and&#10;said to himself, &#34;I must be asleep and dreaming; and yet, if so,&#10;how wonderful for a dream to be so natural and real, and to know at&#10;the same time too that it is but a dream. I hope I shall be able to&#10;remember it all when I wake tomorrow. My sensations seem most&#10;unaccountable. I have a clear perception of everything as if I were&#10;wide awake. I am quite sure if I recollect all this tomorrow, it&#10;will appear utterly ridiculous and absurd. I have had this happen&#10;to me before. It is with the clever or wonderful things we say or&#10;hear in dreams, as with the gold which comes from under the earth,&#10;it is rich and beautiful when we possess it, but when seen in a&#10;true light it is but as stones and withered leaves.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ah!&#34; he sighed mournfully, as he gazed at the birds&#10;singing merrily, or hopping from branch to branch, &#34;they are much&#10;better off than I. Flying is a glorious power. Happy is he who is&#10;born with wings. Yes, if I could change myself into anything I&#10;would be a little lark.&#34; At the same moment his coat-tails and&#10;sleeves grew together and formed wings, his clothes changed to&#10;feathers, and his goloshes to claws. He felt what was taking place,&#10;and laughed to himself. &#34;Well, now it is evident I must be&#10;dreaming; but I never had such a wild dream as this.&#34; And then he&#10;flew up into the green boughs and sang, but there was no poetry in&#10;the song, for his poetic nature had left him. The goloshes, like&#10;all persons who wish to do a thing thoroughly, could only attend to&#10;one thing at a time. He wished to be a poet, and he became one.&#10;Then he wanted to be a little bird, and in this change he lost the&#10;characteristics of the former one. &#34;Well,&#34; thought he, &#34;this is&#10;charming; by day I sit in a police-office, amongst the dryest law&#10;papers, and at night I can dream that I am a lark, flying about in&#10;the gardens of Fredericksburg. Really a complete comedy could be&#10;written about it.&#34; Then he flew down into the grass, turned his&#10;head about in every direction, and tapped his beak on the bending&#10;blades of grass, which, in proportion to his size, seemed to him as&#10;long as the palm-leaves in northern Africa.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In another moment all was darkness around him. It seemed&#10;as if something immense had been thrown over him. A sailor boy had&#10;flung his large cap over the bird, and a hand came underneath and&#10;caught the clerk by the back and wings so roughly, that he&#10;squeaked, and then cried out in his alarm, &#34;You impudent rascal, I&#10;am a clerk in the police-office!&#34; but it only sounded to the boy&#10;like &#34;tweet, tweet;&#34; so he tapped the bird on the beak, and walked&#10;away with him. In the avenue he met two school-boys, who appeared&#10;to belong to a better class of society, but whose inferior&#10;abilities kept them in the lowest class at school. These boys&#10;bought the bird for eightpence, and so the clerk returned to&#10;Copenhagen. &#34;It is well for me that I am dreaming,&#34; he thought;&#10;&#34;otherwise I should become really angry. First I was a poet, and&#10;now I am a lark. It must have been the poetic nature that changed&#10;me into this little creature. It is a miserable story indeed,&#10;especially now I have fallen into the hands of boys. I wonder what&#10;will be the end of it.&#34; The boys carried him into a very elegant&#10;room, where a stout, pleasant-looking lady received them, but she&#10;was not at all gratified to find that they had brought a lark&#8212;a&#10;common field-bird as she called it. However, she allowed them for&#10;one day to place the bird in an empty cage that hung near the&#10;window. &#34;It will please Polly perhaps,&#34; she said, laughing at a&#10;large gray parrot, who was swinging himself proudly on a ring in a&#10;handsome brass cage. &#34;It is Polly&#39;s birthday,&#34; she added in a&#10;simpering tone, &#34;and the little field-bird has come to offer his&#10;congratulations.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Polly did not answer a single word, he continued to swing&#10;proudly to and fro; but a beautiful canary, who had been brought&#10;from his own warm, fragrant fatherland, the summer previous, began&#10;to sing as loud as he could.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You screamer!&#34; said the lady, throwing a white&#10;handkerchief over the cage.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Tweet, tweet,&#34; sighed he, &#34;what a dreadful snowstorm!&#34;&#10;and then he became silent.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The clerk, or as the lady called him the field-bird, was&#10;placed in a little cage close to the canary, and not far from the&#10;parrot. The only human speech which Polly could utter, and which&#10;she sometimes chattered forth most comically, was &#34;Now let us be&#10;men.&#34; All besides was a scream, quite as unintelligible as the&#10;warbling of the canary-bird, excepting to the clerk, who being now&#10;a bird, could understand his comrades very well.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I flew beneath green palm-trees, and amidst the blooming&#10;almond-trees,&#34; sang the canary. &#34;I flew with my brothers and&#10;sisters over beautiful flowers, and across the clear, bright sea,&#10;which reflected the waving foliage in its glittering depths; and I&#10;have seen many gay parrots, who could relate long and delightful&#10;stories.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;They were wild birds,&#34; answered the parrot, &#34;and totally&#10;uneducated. Now let us be men. Why do you not laugh? If the lady&#10;and her visitors can laugh at this, surely you can. It is a great&#10;failing not to be able to appreciate what is amusing. Now let us be&#10;men.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Do you remember,&#34; said the canary, &#34;the pretty maidens&#10;who used to dance in the tents that were spread out beneath the&#10;sweet blossoms? Do you remember the delicious fruit and the cooling&#10;juice from the wild herbs?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, yes,&#34; said the parrot; &#34;but here I am much better&#10;off. I am well fed, and treated politely. I know that I have a&#10;clever head; and what more do I want? Let us be men now. You have a&#10;soul for poetry. I have deep knowledge and wit. You have genius,&#10;but no discretion. You raise your naturally high notes so much,&#10;that you get covered over. They never serve me so. Oh, no; I cost&#10;them something more than you. I keep them in order with my beak,&#10;and fling my wit about me. Now let us be men.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;O my warm, blooming fatherland,&#34; sang the canary bird, &#34;I&#10;will sing of thy dark-green trees and thy quiet streams, where the&#10;bending branches kiss the clear, smooth water. I will sing of the&#10;joy of my brothers and sisters, as their shining plumage flits&#10;among the dark leaves of the plants which grow wild by the&#10;springs.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Do leave off those dismal strains,&#34; said the parrot;&#10;&#34;sing something to make us laugh; laughter is the sign of the&#10;highest order of intellect. Can a dog or a horse laugh? No, they&#10;can cry; but to man alone is the power of laughter given. Ha! ha!&#10;ha!&#34; laughed Polly, and repeated his witty saying, &#34;Now let us be&#10;men.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You little gray Danish bird,&#34; said the canary, &#34;you also&#10;have become a prisoner. It is certainly cold in your forests, but&#10;still there is liberty there. Fly out! they have forgotten to close&#10;the cage, and the window is open at the top. Fly, fly!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Instinctively, the clerk obeyed, and left the cage; at the&#10;same moment the half-opened door leading into the next room creaked&#10;on its hinges, and, stealthily, with green fiery eyes, the cat&#10;crept in and chased the lark round the room. The canary-bird&#10;fluttered in his cage, and the parrot flapped his wings and cried,&#10;&#34;Let us be men;&#34; the poor clerk, in the most deadly terror, flew&#10;through the window, over the houses, and through the streets, till&#10;at length he was obliged to seek a resting-place. A house opposite&#10;to him had a look of home. A window stood open; he flew in, and&#10;perched upon the table. It was his own room. &#34;Let us be men now,&#34;&#10;said he, involuntarily imitating the parrot; and at the same moment&#10;he became a clerk again, only that he was sitting on the table.&#10;&#34;Heaven preserve us!&#34; said he; &#34;How did I get up here and fall&#10;asleep in this way? It was an uneasy dream too that I had. The&#10;whole affair appears most absurd.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('The Best Thing the Goloshes Did'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Early on the following morning, while the clerk was still&#10;in bed, his neighbor, a young divinity student, who lodged on the&#10;same storey, knocked at his door, and then walked in. &#34;Lend me your&#10;goloshes,&#34; said he; &#34;it is so wet in the garden, but the sun is&#10;shining brightly. I should like to go out there and smoke my pipe.&#34;&#10;He put on the goloshes, and was soon in the garden, which contained&#10;only one plum-tree and one apple-tree; yet, in a town, even a small&#10;garden like this is a great advantage.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The student wandered up and down the path; it was just six&#10;o&#39;clock, and he could hear the sound of the post-horn in the&#10;street. &#34;Oh, to travel, to travel!&#34; cried he; &#34;there is no greater&#10;happiness in the world: it is the height of my ambition. This&#10;restless feeling would be stilled, if I could take a journey far&#10;away from this country. I should like to see beautiful Switzerland,&#10;to travel through Italy, and,&#34;&#8212;It was well for him that the&#10;goloshes acted immediately, otherwise he might have been carried&#10;too far for himself as well as for us. In a moment he found himself&#10;in Switzerland, closely packed with eight others in the diligence.&#10;His head ached, his back was stiff, and the blood had ceased to&#10;circulate, so that his feet were swelled and pinched by his boots.&#10;He wavered in a condition between sleeping and waking. In his&#10;right-hand pocket he had a letter of credit; in his left-hand&#10;pocket was his passport; and a few louis d&#39;ors were sewn into a&#10;little leather bag which he carried in his breast-pocket. Whenever&#10;he dozed, he dreamed that he had lost one or another of these&#10;possessions; then he would awake with a start, and the first&#10;movements of his hand formed a triangle from his right-hand pocket&#10;to his breast, and from his breast to his left-hand pocket, to feel&#10;whether they were all safe. Umbrellas, sticks, and hats swung in&#10;the net before him, and almost obstructed the prospect, which was&#10;really very imposing; and as he glanced at it, his memory recalled&#10;the words of one poet at least, who has sung of Switzerland, and&#10;whose poems have not yet been printed:&#8212;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;How lovely to my wondering eyes&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Mont Blanc&#39;s fair summits gently rise;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#39;Tis sweet to breathe the mountain air,-&#60;br /&#62;&#10;If you have gold enough to spare.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Grand, dark, and gloomy appeared the landscape around him.&#10;The pine-forests looked like little groups of moss on high rocks,&#10;whose summits were lost in clouds of mist. Presently it began to&#10;snow, and the wind blew keen and cold. &#34;Ah,&#34; he sighed, &#34;if I were&#10;only on the other side of the Alps now, it would be summer, and I&#10;should be able to get money on my letter of credit. The anxiety I&#10;feel on this matter prevents me from enjoying myself in&#10;Switzerland. Oh, I wish I was on the other side of the&#10;Alps.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And there, in a moment, he found himself, far away in the&#10;midst of Italy, between Florence and Rome, where the lake&#10;Thrasymene glittered in the evening sunlight like a sheet of molten&#10;gold between the dark blue mountains. There, where Hannibal&#10;defeated Flaminius, the grape vines clung to each other with the&#10;friendly grasp of their green tendril fingers; while, by the&#10;wayside, lovely half-naked children were watching a herd of&#10;coal-black swine under the blossoms of fragrant laurel. Could we&#10;rightly describe this picturesque scene, our readers would exclaim,&#10;&#34;Delightful Italy!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But neither the student nor either of his travelling&#10;companions felt the least inclination to think of it in this way.&#10;Poisonous flies and gnats flew into the coach by thousands. In vain&#10;they drove them away with a myrtle branch, the flies stung them&#10;notwithstanding. There was not a man in the coach whose face was&#10;not swollen and disfigured with the stings. The poor horses looked&#10;wretched; the flies settled on their backs in swarms, and they were&#10;only relieved when the coachmen got down and drove the creatures&#10;off.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;As the sun set, an icy coldness filled all nature, not&#10;however of long duration. It produced the feeling which we&#10;experience when we enter a vault at a funeral, on a summer&#39;s day;&#10;while the hills and the clouds put on that singular green hue which&#10;we often notice in old paintings, and look upon as unnatural until&#10;we have ourselves seen nature&#39;s coloring in the south. It was a&#10;glorious spectacle; but the stomachs of the travellers were empty,&#10;their bodies exhausted with fatigue, and all the longings of their&#10;heart turned towards a resting-place for the night; but where to&#10;find one they knew not. All the eyes were too eagerly seeking for&#10;this resting-place, to notice the beauties of nature.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The road passed through a grove of olive-trees; it&#10;reminded the student of the willow-trees at home. Here stood a&#10;lonely inn, and close by it a number of crippled beggars had placed&#10;themselves; the brightest among them looked, to quote the words of&#10;Marryat, &#34;like the eldest son of Famine who had just come of age.&#34;&#10;The others were either blind, or had withered legs, which obliged&#10;them to creep about on their hands and knees, or they had&#10;shrivelled arms and hands without fingers. It was indeed poverty&#10;arrayed in rags. &#34;Eccellenza, miserabili!&#34; they exclaimed,&#10;stretching forth their diseased limbs. The hostess received the&#10;travellers with bare feet, untidy hair, and a dirty blouse. The&#10;doors were fastened together with string; the floors of the rooms&#10;were of brick, broken in many places; bats flew about under the&#10;roof; and as to the odor within&#8212;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Let us have supper laid in the stable,&#34; said one of the&#10;travellers; &#34;then we shall know what we are breathing.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The windows were opened to let in a little fresh air, but&#10;quicker than air came in the withered arms and the continual&#10;whining sounds, &#34;Miserabili, eccellenza. On the walls were&#10;inscriptions, half of them against &#34;la bella Italia.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The supper made its appearance at last. It consisted of&#10;watery soup, seasoned with pepper and rancid oil. This last&#10;delicacy played a principal part in the salad. Musty eggs and&#10;roasted cocks&#39;-combs were the best dishes on the table; even the&#10;wine had a strange taste, it was certainly a mixture. At night, all&#10;the boxes were placed against the doors, and one of the travellers&#10;watched while the others slept. The student&#39;s turn came to watch.&#10;How close the air felt in that room; the heat overpowered him. The&#10;gnats were buzzing about and stinging, while the miserabili,&#10;outside, moaned in their dreams.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Travelling would be all very well,&#34; said the student of&#10;divinity to himself, &#34;if we had no bodies, or if the body could&#10;rest while the soul if flying. Wherever I go I feel a want which&#10;oppresses my heart, for something better presents itself at the&#10;moment; yes, something better, which shall be the best of all; but&#10;where is that to be found? In fact, I know in my heart very well&#10;what I want. I wish to attain the greatest of all&#10;happiness.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;No sooner were the words spoken than he was at home. Long&#10;white curtains shaded the windows of his room, and in the middle of&#10;the floor stood a black coffin, in which he now lay in the still&#10;sleep of death; his wish was fulfilled, his body was at rest, and&#10;his spirit travelling.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Esteem no man happy until he is in his grave,&#34; were the&#10;words of Solon. Here was a strong fresh proof of their truth. Every&#10;corpse is a sphinx of immortality. The sphinx in this sarcophagus&#10;might unveil its own mystery in the words which the living had&#10;himself written two days before&#8212;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Stern death, thy chilling silence waketh dread;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Yet in thy darkest hour there may be light.&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Earth&#39;s garden reaper! from the grave&#39;s cold bed&#60;br /&#62;&#10;The soul on Jacob&#39;s ladder takes her flight.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Man&#39;s greatest sorrows often are a part&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Of hidden griefs, concealed from human eyes,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Which press far heavier on the lonely heart&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Than now the earth that on his coffin lies.&#34;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Two figures were moving about the room; we know them both.&#10;One was the fairy named Care, the other the messenger of Fortune.&#10;They bent over the dead.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Look!&#34; said Care; &#34;what happiness have your goloshes&#10;brought to mankind?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;They have at least brought lasting happiness to him who&#10;slumbers here,&#34; she said.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Not so,&#34; said Care, &#34;he went away of himself, he was not&#10;summoned. His mental powers were not strong enough to discern the&#10;treasures which he had been destined to discover. I will do him a&#10;favor now.&#34; And she drew the goloshes from his feet.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The sleep of death was ended, and the recovered man raised&#10;himself. Care vanished, and with her the goloshes; doubtless she&#10;looked upon them as her own property. &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode(''), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;THE mayor stood at the open window. He looked smart, for&#10;his shirt-frill, in which he had stuck a breast-pin, and his&#10;ruffles, were very fine. He had shaved his chin uncommonly smooth,&#10;although he had cut himself slightly, and had stuck a piece of&#10;newspaper over the place. &#34;Hark &#39;ee, youngster!&#34; cried&#10;he.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The boy to whom he spoke was no other than the son of a&#10;poor washer-woman, who was just going past the house. He stopped,&#10;and respectfully took off his cap. The peak of this cap was broken&#10;in the middle, so that he could easily roll it up and put it in his&#10;pocket. He stood before the mayor in his poor but clean and&#10;well-mended clothes, with heavy wooden shoes on his feet, looking&#10;as humble as if it had been the king himself.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You are a good and civil boy,&#34; said the mayor. &#34;I suppose&#10;your mother is busy washing the clothes down by the river, and you&#10;are going to carry that thing to her that you have in your pocket.&#10;It is very bad for your mother. How much have you got in&#10;it?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Only half a quartern,&#34; stammered the boy in a frightened&#10;voice.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And she has had just as much this morning&#10;already?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No, it was yesterday,&#34; replied the boy.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Two halves make a whole,&#34; said the mayor. &#34;She&#39;s good for&#10;nothing. What a sad thing it is with these people. Tell your mother&#10;she ought to be ashamed of herself. Don&#39;t you become a drunkard,&#10;but I expect you will though. Poor child! there, go&#10;now.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The boy went on his way with his cap in his hand, while&#10;the wind fluttered his golden hair till the locks stood up&#10;straight. He turned round the corner of the street into the little&#10;lane that led to the river, where his mother stood in the water by&#10;her washing bench, beating the linen with a heavy wooden bar. The&#10;floodgates at the mill had been drawn up, and as the water rolled&#10;rapidly on, the sheets were dragged along by the stream, and nearly&#10;overturned the bench, so that the washer-woman was obliged to lean&#10;against it to keep it steady. &#34;I have been very nearly carried&#10;away,&#34; she said; &#34;it is a good thing that you are come, for I want&#10;something to strengthen me. It is cold in the water, and I have&#10;stood here six hours. Have you brought anything for me?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The boy drew the bottle from his pocket, and the mother&#10;put it to her lips, and drank a little.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ah, how much good that does, and how it warms me,&#34; she&#10;said; &#34;it is as good as a hot meal, and not so dear. Drink a&#10;little, my boy; you look quite pale; you are shivering in your thin&#10;clothes, and autumn has really come. Oh, how cold the water is! I&#10;hope I shall not be ill. But no, I must not be afraid of that. Give&#10;me a little more, and you may have a sip too, but only a sip; you&#10;must not get used to it, my poor, dear child.&#34; She stepped up to&#10;the bridge on which the boy stood as she spoke, and came on shore.&#10;The water dripped from the straw mat which she had bound round her&#10;body, and from her gown. &#34;I work hard and suffer pain with my poor&#10;hands,&#34; said she, &#34;but I do it willingly, that I may be able to&#10;bring you up honestly and truthfully, my dear boy.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;At the same moment, a woman, rather older than herself,&#10;came towards them. She was a miserable-looking object, lame of one&#10;leg, and with a large false curl hanging down over one of her eyes,&#10;which was blind. This curl was intended to conceal the blind eye,&#10;but it made the defect only more visible. She was a friend of the&#10;laundress, and was called, among the neighbors, &#34;Lame Martha, with&#10;the curl.&#34; &#34;Oh, you poor thing; how you do work, standing there in&#10;the water!&#34; she exclaimed. &#34;You really do need something to give&#10;you a little warmth, and yet spiteful people cry out about the few&#10;drops you take.&#34; And then Martha repeated to the laundress, in a&#10;very few minutes, all that the mayor had said to her boy, which she&#10;had overheard; and she felt very angry that any man could speak, as&#10;he had done, of a mother to her own child, about the few drops she&#10;had taken; and she was still more angry because, on that very day,&#10;the mayor was going to have a dinner-party, at which there would be&#10;wine, strong, rich wine, drunk by the bottle. &#34;Many will take more&#10;than they ought, but they don&#39;t call that drinking! They are all&#10;right, you are good for nothing indeed!&#34; cried Martha&#10;indignantly.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And so he spoke to you in that way, did he, my child?&#34;&#10;said the washer-woman, and her lips trembled as she spoke. &#34;He says&#10;you have a mother who is good for nothing. Well, perhaps he is&#10;right, but he should not have said it to my child. How much has&#10;happened to me from that house!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes,&#34; said Martha; &#34;I remember you were in service there,&#10;and lived in the house when the mayor&#39;s parents were alive; how&#10;many years ago that is. Bushels of salt have been eaten since then,&#10;and people may well be thirsty,&#34; and Martha smiled. &#34;The mayor&#39;s&#10;great dinner-party to-day ought to have been put off, but the news&#10;came too late. The footman told me the dinner was already cooked,&#10;when a letter came to say that the mayor&#39;s younger brother in&#10;Copenhagen is dead.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Dead!&#34; cried the laundress, turning pale as&#10;death.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, certainly,&#34; replied Martha; &#34;but why do you take it&#10;so much to heart? I suppose you knew him years ago, when you were&#10;in service there?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Is he dead?&#34; she exclaimed. &#34;Oh, he was such a kind,&#10;good-hearted man, there are not many like him,&#34; and the tears&#10;rolled down her cheeks as she spoke. Then she cried, &#34;Oh, dear me;&#10;I feel quite ill: everything is going round me, I cannot bear it.&#10;Is the bottle empty?&#34; and she leaned against the plank.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Dear me, you are ill indeed,&#34; said the other woman.&#10;&#34;Come, cheer up; perhaps it will pass off. No, indeed, I see you&#10;are really ill; the best thing for me to do is to lead you&#10;home.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But my washing yonder?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I will take care of that. Come, give me your arm. The boy&#10;can stay here and take care of the linen, and I&#39;ll come back and&#10;finish the washing; it is but a trifle.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The limbs of the laundress shook under her, and she said,&#10;&#34;I have stood too long in the cold water, and I have had nothing to&#10;eat the whole day since the morning. O kind Heaven, help me to get&#10;home; I am in a burning fever. Oh, my poor child,&#34; and she burst&#10;into tears. And he, poor boy, wept also, as he sat alone by the&#10;river, near to and watching the damp linen.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The two women walked very slowly. The laundress slipped&#10;and tottered through the lane, and round the corner, into the&#10;street where the mayor lived; and just as she reached the front of&#10;his house, she sank down upon the pavement. Many persons came round&#10;her, and Lame Martha ran into the house for help. The mayor and his&#10;guests came to the window.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, it is the laundress,&#34; said he; &#34;she has had a little&#10;drop too much. She is good for nothing. It is a sad thing for her&#10;pretty little son. I like the boy very well; but the mother is good&#10;for nothing.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;After a while the laundress recovered herself, and they&#10;led her to her poor dwelling, and put her to bed. Kind Martha&#10;warmed a mug of beer for her, with butter and sugar&#8212;she considered&#10;this the best medicine&#8212;and then hastened to the river, washed and&#10;rinsed, badly enough, to be sure, but she did her best. Then she&#10;drew the linen ashore, wet as it was, and laid it in a basket.&#10;Before evening, she was sitting in the poor little room with the&#10;laundress. The mayor&#39;s cook had given her some roasted potatoes and&#10;a beautiful piece of fat for the sick woman. Martha and the boy&#10;enjoyed these good things very much; but the sick woman could only&#10;say that the smell was very nourishing, she thought. By-and-by the&#10;boy was put to bed, in the same bed as the one in which his mother&#10;lay; but he slept at her feet, covered with an old quilt made of&#10;blue and white patchwork. The laundress felt a little better by&#10;this time. The warm beer had strengthened her, and the smell of the&#10;good food had been pleasant to her.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Many thanks, you good soul,&#34; she said to Martha. &#34;Now the&#10;boy is asleep, I will tell you all. He is soon asleep. How gentle&#10;and sweet he looks as he lies there with his eyes closed! He does&#10;not know how his mother has suffered; and Heaven grant he never may&#10;know it. I was in service at the counsellor&#39;s, the father of the&#10;mayor, and it happened that the youngest of his sons, the student,&#10;came home. I was a young wild girl then, but honest; that I can&#10;declare in the sight of Heaven. The student was merry and gay,&#10;brave and affectionate; every drop of blood in him was good and&#10;honorable; a better man never lived on earth. He was the son of the&#10;house, and I was only a maid; but he loved me truly and honorably,&#10;and he told his mother of it. She was to him as an angel upon&#10;earth; she was so wise and loving. He went to travel, and before he&#10;started he placed a gold ring on my finger; and as soon as he was&#10;out of the house, my mistress sent for me. Gently and earnestly she&#10;drew me to her, and spake as if an angel were speaking. She showed&#10;me clearly, in spirit and in truth, the difference there was&#10;between him and me. &#39;He is pleased now,&#39; she said, &#39;with your&#10;pretty face; but good looks do not last long. You have not been&#10;educated like he has. You are not equals in mind and rank, and&#10;therein lies the misfortune. I esteem the poor,&#39; she added. &#39;In the&#10;sight of God, they may occupy a higher place than many of the rich;&#10;but here upon earth we must beware of entering upon a false track,&#10;lest we are overturned in our plans, like a carriage that travels&#10;by a dangerous road. I know a worthy man, an artisan, who wishes to&#10;marry you. I mean Eric, the glovemaker. He is a widower, without&#10;children, and in a good position. Will you think it over?&#39; Every&#10;word she said pierced my heart like a knife; but I knew she was&#10;right, and the thought pressed heavily upon me. I kissed her hand,&#10;and wept bitter tears, and I wept still more when I went to my&#10;room, and threw myself on the bed. I passed through a dreadful&#10;night; God knows what I suffered, and how I struggled. The&#10;following Sunday I went to the house of God to pray for light to&#10;direct my path. It seemed like a providence that as I stepped out&#10;of church Eric came towards me; and then there remained not a doubt&#10;in my mind. We were suited to each other in rank and circumstances.&#10;He was, even then, a man of good means. I went up to him, and took&#10;his hand, and said, &#39;Do you still feel the same for me?&#39; &#39;Yes; ever&#10;and always,&#39; said he. &#39;Will you, then, marry a maiden who honors&#10;and esteems you, although she cannot offer you her love? but that&#10;may come.&#39; &#39;Yes, it will come,&#39; said he; and we joined our hands&#10;together, and I went home to my mistress. The gold ring which her&#10;son had given me I wore next to my heart. I could not place it on&#10;my finger during the daytime, but only in the evening, when I went&#10;to bed. I kissed the ring till my lips almost bled, and then I gave&#10;it to my mistress, and told her that the banns were to be put up&#10;for me and the glovemaker the following week. Then my mistress&#10;threw her arms round me, and kissed me. She did not say that I was&#10;&#39;good for nothing;&#39; very likely I was better then than I am now;&#10;but the misfortunes of this world, were unknown to me then. At&#10;Michaelmas we were married, and for the first year everything went&#10;well with us. We had a journeyman and an apprentice, and you were&#10;our servant, Martha.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ah, yes, and you were a dear, good mistress,&#34; said&#10;Martha, &#34;I shall never forget how kind you and your husband were to&#10;me.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, those were happy years when you were with us,&#10;although we had no children at first. The student I never met&#10;again. Yet I saw him once, although he did not see me. He came to&#10;his mother&#39;s funeral. I saw him, looking pale as death, and deeply&#10;troubled, standing at her grave; for she was his mother. Sometime&#10;after, when his father died, he was in foreign lands, and did not&#10;come home. I know that he never married, I believe he became a&#10;lawyer. He had forgotten me, and even had we met he would not have&#10;known me, for I have lost all my good looks, and perhaps that is&#10;all for the best.&#34; And then she spoke of the dark days of trial,&#10;when misfortune had fallen upon them.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;We had five hundred dollars,&#34; she said, &#34;and there was a&#10;house in the street to be sold for two hundred, so we thought it&#10;would be worth our while to pull it down and build a new one in its&#10;place; so it was bought. The builder and carpenter made an estimate&#10;that the new house would cost ten hundred and twenty dollars to&#10;build. Eric had credit, so he borrowed the money in the chief town.&#10;But the captain, who was bringing it to him, was shipwrecked, and&#10;the money lost. Just about this time, my dear sweet boy, who lies&#10;sleeping there, was born, and my husband was attacked with a severe&#10;lingering illness. For three quarters of a year I was obliged to&#10;dress and undress him. We were backward in our payments, we&#10;borrowed more money, and all that we had was lost and sold, and&#10;then my husband died. Since then I have worked, toiled, and striven&#10;for the sake of the child. I have scrubbed and washed both coarse&#10;and fine linen, but I have not been able to make myself better off;&#10;and it was God&#39;s will. In His own time He will take me to Himself,&#10;but I know He will never forsake my boy.&#34; Then she fell asleep. In&#10;the morning she felt much refreshed, and strong enough, as she&#10;thought, to go on with her work. But as soon as she stepped into&#10;the cold water, a sudden faintness seized her; she clutched at the&#10;air convulsively with her hand, took one step forward, and fell.&#10;Her head rested on dry land, but her feet were in the water; her&#10;wooden shoes, which were only tied on by a wisp of straw, were&#10;carried away by the stream, and thus she was found by Martha when&#10;she came to bring her some coffee.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the meantime a messenger had been sent to her house by&#10;the mayor, to say that she must come to him immediately, as he had&#10;something to tell her. It was too late; a surgeon had been sent for&#10;to open a vein in her arm, but the poor woman was dead.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;She has drunk herself to death,&#34; said the cruel mayor. In&#10;the letter, containing the news of his brother&#39;s death, it was&#10;stated that he had left in his will a legacy of six hundred dollars&#10;to the glovemaker&#39;s widow, who had been his mother&#39;s maid, to be&#10;paid with discretion, in large or small sums to the widow or her&#10;child.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;There was something between my brother and her, I&#10;remember,&#34; said the mayor; &#34;it is a good thing that she is out of&#10;the way, for now the boy will have the whole. I will place him with&#10;honest people to bring him up, that he may become a respectable&#10;working man.&#34; And the blessing of God rested upon these words. The&#10;mayor sent for the boy to come to him, and promised to take care of&#10;him, but most cruelly added that it was a good thing that his&#10;mother was dead, for &#34;she was good for nothing.&#34; They carried her&#10;to the churchyard, the churchyard in which the poor were buried.&#10;Martha strewed sand on the grave and planted a rose-tree upon it,&#10;and the boy stood by her side.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, my poor mother!&#34; he cried, while the tears rolled&#10;down his cheeks. &#34;Is it true what they say, that she was good for&#10;nothing?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No, indeed, it is not true,&#34; replied the old servant,&#10;raising her eyes to heaven; &#34;she was worth a great deal; I knew it&#10;years ago, and since the last night of her life I am more certain&#10;of it than ever. I say she was a good and worthy woman, and God,&#10;who is in heaven, knows I am speaking the truth, though the world&#10;may say, even now she was good for nothing.&#34; &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode(''), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;GRANDMOTHER is very old, her face is wrinkled, and her&#10;hair is quite white; but her eyes are like two stars, and they have&#10;a mild, gentle expression in them when they look at you, which does&#10;you good. She wears a dress of heavy, rich silk, with large flowers&#10;worked on it; and it rustles when she moves. And then she can tell&#10;the most wonderful stories. Grandmother knows a great deal, for she&#10;was alive before father and mother&#8212;that&#39;s quite certain. She has a&#10;hymn-book with large silver clasps, in which she often reads; and&#10;in the book, between the leaves, lies a rose, quite flat and dry;&#10;it is not so pretty as the roses which are standing in the glass,&#10;and yet she smiles at it most pleasantly, and tears even come into&#10;her eyes. &#34;I wonder why grandmother looks at the withered flower in&#10;the old book that way? Do you know?&#34; Why, when grandmother&#39;s tears&#10;fall upon the rose, and she is looking at it, the rose revives, and&#10;fills the room with its fragrance; the walls vanish as in a mist,&#10;and all around her is the glorious green wood, where in summer the&#10;sunlight streams through thick foliage; and grandmother, why she is&#10;young again, a charming maiden, fresh as a rose, with round, rosy&#10;cheeks, fair, bright ringlets, and a figure pretty and graceful;&#10;but the eyes, those mild, saintly eyes, are the same,&#8212;they have&#10;been left to grandmother. At her side sits a young man, tall and&#10;strong; he gives her a rose and she smiles. Grandmother cannot&#10;smile like that now. Yes, she is smiling at the memory of that day,&#10;and many thoughts and recollections of the past; but the handsome&#10;young man is gone, and the rose has withered in the old book, and&#10;grandmother is sitting there, again an old woman, looking down upon&#10;the withered rose in the book.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Grandmother is dead now. She had been sitting in her&#10;arm-chair, telling us a long, beautiful tale; and when it was&#10;finished, she said she was tired, and leaned her head back to sleep&#10;awhile. We could hear her gentle breathing as she slept; gradually&#10;it became quieter and calmer, and on her countenance beamed&#10;happiness and peace. It was as if lighted up with a ray of&#10;sunshine. She smiled once more, and then people said she was dead.&#10;She was laid in a black coffin, looking mild and beautiful in the&#10;white folds of the shrouded linen, though her eyes were closed; but&#10;every wrinkle had vanished, her hair looked white and silvery, and&#10;around her mouth lingered a sweet smile. We did not feel at all&#10;afraid to look at the corpse of her who had been such a dear, good&#10;grandmother. The hymn-book, in which the rose still lay, was placed&#10;under her head, for so she had wished it; and then they buried&#10;grandmother.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;On the grave, close by the churchyard wall, they planted a&#10;rose-tree; it was soon full of roses, and the nightingale sat among&#10;the flowers, and sang over the grave. From the organ in the church&#10;sounded the music and the words of the beautiful psalms, which were&#10;written in the old book under the head of the dead one.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The moon shone down upon the grave, but the dead was not&#10;there; every child could go safely, even at night, and pluck a rose&#10;from the tree by the churchyard wall. The dead know more than we do&#10;who are living. They know what a terror would come upon us if such&#10;a strange thing were to happen, as the appearance of a dead person&#10;among us. They are better off than we are; the dead return no more.&#10;The earth has been heaped on the coffin, and it is earth only that&#10;lies within it. The leaves of the hymn-book are dust; and the rose,&#10;with all its recollections, has crumbled to dust also. But over the&#10;grave fresh roses bloom, the nightingale sings, and the organ&#10;sounds and there still lives a remembrance of old grandmother, with&#10;the loving, gentle eyes that always looked young. Eyes can never&#10;die. Ours will once again behold dear grandmother, young and&#10;beautiful as when, for the first time, she kissed the fresh, red&#10;rose, that is now dust in the grave. &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')

In the&#10;meantime, there arrived from the next town a lady; she had a pug&#10;dog with her, and came, she said, to dispose of shares in her&#10;tan-yard. She had her papers with her, and we advised her to put&#10;them in an envelope, and to write thereon the address of the&#10;proprietor of the estate, &#34;General War-Commissary Knight,&#34;&#10;&#38;amp;c.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;She listened to us attentively, seized the pen, paused,&#10;and begged us to repeat the direction slowly. We complied, and she&#10;wrote; but in the midst of the &#34;General War-&#34; she struck fast,&#10;sighed deeply, and said, &#34;I am only a woman!&#34; Her Puggie had seated&#10;itself on the ground while she wrote, and growled; for the dog had&#10;come with her for amusement and for the sake of its health; and&#10;then the bare floor ought not to be offered to a visitor. His&#10;outward appearance was characterized by a snub nose and a very fat&#10;back.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;He doesn&#39;t bite,&#34; said the lady; &#34;he has no teeth. He is&#10;like one of the family, faithful and grumpy; but the latter is my&#10;grandchildren&#39;s fault, for they have teased him; they play at&#10;wedding, and want to give him the part of the bridesmaid, and&#10;that&#39;s too much for him, poor old fellow.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And she delivered her papers, and took Puggie upon her&#10;arm. And this is the first part of the story which might have been&#10;left out.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;PUGGIE DIED!! That&#39;s the second part.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was about a week afterwards we arrived in the town, and&#10;put up at the inn. Our windows looked into the tan-yard, which was&#10;divided into two parts by a partition of planks; in one half were&#10;many skins and hides, raw and tanned. Here was all the apparatus&#10;necessary to carry on a tannery, and it belonged to the widow.&#10;Puggie had died in the morning, and was to be buried in this part&#10;of the yard; the grandchildren of the widow (that is, of the&#10;tanner&#39;s widow, for Puggie had never been married) filled up the&#10;grave, and it was a beautiful grave&#8212;it must have been quite&#10;pleasant to lie there.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The grave was bordered with pieces of flower-pots and&#10;strewn over with sand; quite at the top they had stuck up half a&#10;beer bottle, with the neck upwards, and that was not at all&#10;allegorical.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The children danced round the grave, and the eldest of the&#10;boys among them, a practical youngster of seven years, made the&#10;proposition that there should be an exhibition of Puggie&#39;s&#10;burial-place for all who lived in the lane; the price of admission&#10;was to be a trouser button, for every boy would be sure to have&#10;one, and each might also give one for a little girl. This proposal&#10;was adopted by acclamation.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And all the children out of the lane&#8212;yes, even out of the&#10;little lane at the back&#8212;flocked to the place, and each gave a&#10;button. Many were noticed to go about on that afternoon with only&#10;one suspender; but then they had seen Puggie&#39;s grave, and the sight&#10;was worth much more.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But in front of the tan-yard, close to the entrance, stood&#10;a little girl clothed in rags, very pretty to look at, with curly&#10;hair, and eyes so blue and clear that it was a pleasure to look&#10;into them. The child said not a word, nor did she cry; but each&#10;time the little door was opened she gave a long, long look into the&#10;yard. She had not a button&#8212;that she knew right well, and therefore&#10;she remained standing sorrowfully outside, till all the others had&#10;seen the grave and had gone away; then she sat down, held her&#10;little brown hands before her eyes, and burst into tears; this girl&#10;alone had not seen Puggie&#39;s grave. It was a grief as great to her&#10;as any grown person can experience.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;We saw this from above; and looked at from above, how many&#10;a grief of our own and of others can make us smile! That is the&#10;story, and whoever does not understand it may go and purchase a&#10;share in the tan-yard from the window. &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')

A burdock never&#10;grows alone; where it grows, there are many more, and it is a&#10;splendid sight; and all this splendor is good for snails. The great&#10;white snails, which grand people in olden times used to have made&#10;into fricassees; and when they had eaten them, they would say, &#34;O,&#10;what a delicious dish!&#34; for these people really thought them good;&#10;and these snails lived on burdock-leaves, and for them the burdock&#10;was planted.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;There was once an old estate where no one now lived to&#10;require snails; indeed, the owners had all died out, but the&#10;burdock still flourished; it grew over all the beds and walks of&#10;the garden&#8212;its growth had no check&#8212;till it became at last quite a&#10;forest of burdocks. Here and there stood an apple or a plum-tree;&#10;but for this, nobody would have thought the place had ever been a&#10;garden. It was burdock from one end to the other; and here lived&#10;the last two surviving snails. They knew not themselves how old&#10;they were; but they could remember the time when there were a great&#10;many more of them, and that they were descended from a family which&#10;came from foreign lands, and that the whole forest had been planted&#10;for them and theirs. They had never been away from the garden; but&#10;they knew that another place once existed in the world, called the&#10;Duke&#39;s Palace Castle, in which some of their relations had been&#10;boiled till they became black, and were then laid on a silver dish;&#10;but what was done afterwards they did not know. Besides, they could&#10;not imagine exactly how it felt to be boiled and placed on a silver&#10;dish; but no doubt it was something very fine and highly genteel.&#10;Neither the cockchafer, nor the toad, nor the earth-worm, whom they&#10;questioned about it, would give them the least information; for&#10;none of their relations had ever been cooked or served on a silver&#10;dish. The old white snails were the most aristocratic race in the&#10;world,&#8212;they knew that. The forest had been planted for them, and&#10;the nobleman&#39;s castle had been built entirely that they might be&#10;cooked and laid on silver dishes.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;They lived quite retired and very happily; and as they had&#10;no children of their own, they had adopted a little common snail,&#10;which they brought up as their own child. The little one would not&#10;grow, for he was only a common snail; but the old people,&#10;particularly the mother-snail, declared that she could easily see&#10;how he grew; and when the father said he could not perceive it, she&#10;begged him to feel the little snail&#39;s shell, and he did so, and&#10;found that the mother was right.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;One day it rained very fast. &#34;Listen, what a drumming&#10;there is on the burdock-leaves; turn, turn, turn; turn, turn,&#10;turn,&#34; said the father-snail.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;There come the drops,&#34; said the mother; &#34;they are&#10;trickling down the stalks. We shall have it very wet here&#10;presently. I am very glad we have such good houses, and that the&#10;little one has one of his own. There has been really more done for&#10;us than for any other creature; it is quite plain that we are the&#10;most noble people in the world. We have houses from our birth, and&#10;the burdock forest has been planted for us. I should very much like&#10;to know how far it extends, and what lies beyond it.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;There can be nothing better than we have here,&#34; said the&#10;father-snail; &#34;I wish for nothing more.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, but I do,&#34; said the mother; &#34;I should like to be&#10;taken to the palace, and boiled, and laid upon a silver dish, as&#10;was done to all our ancestors; and you may be sure it must be&#10;something very uncommon.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The nobleman&#39;s castle, perhaps, has fallen to decay,&#34;&#10;said the snail-father, or the burdock wood may have grown out. You&#10;need not be in a hurry; you are always so impatient, and the&#10;youngster is getting just the same. He has been three days creeping&#10;to the top of that stalk. I feel quite giddy when I look at&#10;him.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You must not scold him,&#34; said the mother-snail; &#34;he&#10;creeps so very carefully. He will be the joy of our home; and we&#10;old folks have nothing else to live for. But have you ever thought&#10;where we are to get a wife for him? Do you think that farther out&#10;in the wood there may be others of our race?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;There may be black snails, no doubt,&#34; said the old snail;&#10;&#34;black snails without houses; but they are so vulgar and conceited&#10;too. But we can give the ants a commission; they run here and&#10;there, as if they all had so much business to get through. They,&#10;most likely, will know of a wife for our youngster.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I certainly know a most beautiful bride,&#34; said one of the&#10;ants; &#34;but I fear it would not do, for she is a queen.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That does not matter,&#34; said the old snail; &#34;has she a&#10;house?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;She has a palace,&#34; replied the ant,&#8212;&#34;a most beautiful&#10;ant-palace with seven hundred passages.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Thank-you,&#34; said the mother-snail; &#34;but our boy shall not&#10;go to live in an ant-hill. If you know of nothing better, we will&#10;give the commission to the white gnats; they fly about in rain and&#10;sunshine; they know the burdock wood from one end to the&#10;other.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;We have a wife for him,&#34; said the gnats; &#34;a hundred&#10;man-steps from here there is a little snail with a house, sitting&#10;on a gooseberry-bush; she is quite alone, and old enough to be&#10;married. It is only a hundred man-steps from here.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Then let her come to him,&#34; said the old people. &#34;He has&#10;the whole burdock forest; she has only a bush.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;So they brought the little lady-snail. She took eight days&#10;to perform the journey; but that was just as it ought to be; for it&#10;showed her to be one of the right breeding. And then they had a&#10;wedding. Six glow-worms gave as much light as they could; but in&#10;other respects it was all very quiet; for the old snails could not&#10;bear festivities or a crowd. But a beautiful speech was made by the&#10;mother-snail. The father could not speak; he was too much overcome.&#10;Then they gave the whole burdock forest to the young snails as an&#10;inheritance, and repeated what they had so often said, that it was&#10;the finest place in the world, and that if they led upright and&#10;honorable lives, and their family increased, they and their&#10;children might some day be taken to the nobleman&#39;s palace, to be&#10;boiled black, and laid on a silver dish. And when they had finished&#10;speaking, the old couple crept into their houses, and came out no&#10;more; for they slept.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The young snail pair now ruled in the forest, and had a&#10;numerous progeny. But as the young ones were never boiled or laid&#10;in silver dishes, they concluded that the castle had fallen into&#10;decay, and that all the people in the world were dead; and as&#10;nobody contradicted them, they thought they must be right. And the&#10;rain fell upon the burdock-leaves, to play the drum for them, and&#10;the sun shone to paint colors on the burdock forest for them, and&#10;they were very happy; the whole family were entirely and perfectly&#10;happy. &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')

As he was kissing the&#10;flower a very little leaf fell from it and sunk down into the soft&#10;earth in the middle of a wood. It immediately took root, sprouted,&#10;and sent out shoots among the other plants.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What a ridiculous little shoot!&#34; said one. &#34;No one will&#10;recognize it; not even the thistle nor the&#10;stinging-nettle.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It must be a kind of garden plant,&#34; said another; and so&#10;they sneered and despised the plant as a thing from a&#10;garden.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Where are you coming?&#34; said the tall thistles whose&#10;leaves were all armed with thorns. &#34;It is stupid nonsense to allow&#10;yourself to shoot out in this way; we are not here to support&#10;you.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Winter came, and the plant was covered with snow, but the&#10;snow glittered over it as if it had sunshine beneath as well as&#10;above.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;When spring came, the plant appeared in full bloom: a more&#10;beautiful object than any other plant in the forest. And now the&#10;professor of botany presented himself, one who could explain his&#10;knowledge in black and white. He examined and tested the plant, but&#10;it did not belong to his system of botany, nor could he possibly&#10;find out to what class it did belong. &#34;It must be some degenerate&#10;species,&#34; said he; &#34;I do not know it, and it is not mentioned in&#10;any system.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Not known in any system!&#34; repeated the thistles and the&#10;nettles.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The large trees which grew round it saw the plant and&#10;heard the remarks, but they said not a word either good or bad,&#10;which is the wisest plan for those who are ignorant.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;There passed through the forest a poor innocent girl; her&#10;heart was pure, and her understanding increased by her faith. Her&#10;chief inheritance had been an old Bible, which she read and valued.&#10;From its pages she heard the voice of God speaking to her, and&#10;telling her to remember what was said of Joseph&#39;s brethren when&#10;persons wished to injure her. &#34;They imagined evil in their hearts,&#10;but God turned it to good.&#34; If we suffer wrongfully, if we are&#10;misunderstood or despised, we must think of Him who was pure and&#10;holy, and who prayed for those who nailed Him to the cross, &#34;Father&#10;forgive them, for they know not what they do.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The girl stood still before the wonderful plant, for the&#10;green leaves exhaled a sweet and refreshing fragrance, and the&#10;flowers glittered and sparkled in the sunshine like colored flames,&#10;and the harmony of sweet sounds lingered round them as if each&#10;concealed within itself a deep fount of melody, which thousands of&#10;years could not exhaust. With pious gratitude the girl looked upon&#10;this glorious work of God, and bent down over one of the branches,&#10;that she might examine the flower and inhale the sweet perfume.&#10;Then a light broke in on her mind, and her heart expanded. Gladly&#10;would she have plucked a flower, but she could not overcome her&#10;reluctance to break one off. She knew it would so soon fade; so she&#10;took only a single green leaf, carried it home, and laid it in her&#10;Bible, where it remained ever green, fresh, and unfading. Between&#10;the pages of the Bible it still lay when, a few weeks afterwards,&#10;that Bible was laid under the young girl&#39;s head in her coffin. A&#10;holy calm rested on her face, as if the earthly remains bore the&#10;impress of the truth that she now stood in the presence of&#10;God.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the forest the wonderful plant still continued to bloom&#10;till it grew and became almost a tree, and all the birds of passage&#10;bowed themselves before it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That plant is a foreigner, no doubt,&#34; said the thistles&#10;and the burdocks. &#34;We can never conduct ourselves like that in this&#10;country.&#34; And the black forest snails actually spat at the&#10;flower.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then came the swineherd; he was collecting thistles and&#10;shrubs to burn them for the ashes. He pulled up the wonderful&#10;plant, roots and all, and placed it in his bundle. &#34;This will be as&#10;useful as any,&#34; he said; so the plant was carried away.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Not long after, the king of the country suffered from the&#10;deepest melancholy. He was diligent and industrious, but employment&#10;did him no good. They read deep and learned books to him, and then&#10;the lightest and most trifling that could be found, but all to no&#10;purpose. Then they applied for advice to one of the wise men of the&#10;world, and he sent them a message to say that there was one remedy&#10;which would relieve and cure him, and that it was a plant of&#10;heavenly origin which grew in the forest in the king&#39;s own&#10;dominions. The messenger described the flower so that is appearance&#10;could not be mistaken.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then said the swineherd, &#34;I am afraid I carried this plant&#10;away from the forest in my bundle, and it has been burnt to ashes&#10;long ago. But I did not know any better.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You did not know, any better! Ignorance upon ignorance&#10;indeed!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The poor swineherd took these words to heart, for they&#10;were addressed to him; he knew not that there were others who were&#10;equally ignorant. Not even a leaf of the plant could be found.&#10;There was one, but it lay in the coffin of the dead; no one knew&#10;anything about it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the king, in his melancholy, wandered out to the spot&#10;in the wood. &#34;Here is where the plant stood,&#34; he said; &#34;it is a&#10;sacred place.&#34; Then he ordered that the place should be surrounded&#10;with a golden railing, and a sentry stationed near it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The botanical professor wrote a long treatise about the&#10;heavenly plant, and for this he was loaded with gold, which&#10;improved the position of himself and his family.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And this part is really the most pleasant part of the&#10;story. For the plant had disappeared, and the king remained as&#10;melancholy and sad as ever, but the sentry said he had always been&#10;so. &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode(''), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;IN Denmark there stands an old castle named Kronenburg,&#10;close by the Sound of Elsinore, where large ships, both English,&#10;Russian, and Prussian, pass by hundreds every day. And they salute&#10;the old castle with cannons, &#34;Boom, boom,&#34; which is as if they&#10;said, &#34;Good-day.&#34; And the cannons of the old castle answer &#34;Boom,&#34;&#10;which means &#34;Many thanks.&#34; In winter no ships sail by, for the&#10;whole Sound is covered with ice as far as the Swedish coast, and&#10;has quite the appearance of a high-road. The Danish and the Swedish&#10;flags wave, and Danes and Swedes say, &#34;Good-day,&#34; and &#34;Thank you&#34;&#10;to each other, not with cannons, but with a friendly shake of the&#10;hand; and they exchange white bread and biscuits with each other,&#10;because foreign articles taste the best.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But the most beautiful sight of all is the old castle of&#10;Kronenburg, where Holger Danske sits in the deep, dark cellar, into&#10;which no one goes. He is clad in iron and steel, and rests his head&#10;on his strong arm; his long beard hangs down upon the marble table,&#10;into which it has become firmly rooted; he sleeps and dreams, but&#10;in his dreams he sees everything that happens in Denmark. On each&#10;Christmas-eve an angel comes to him and tells him that all he has&#10;dreamed is true, and that he may go to sleep again in peace, as&#10;Denmark is not yet in any real danger; but should danger ever come,&#10;then Holger Danske will rouse himself, and the table will burst&#10;asunder as he draws out his beard. Then he will come forth in his&#10;strength, and strike a blow that shall sound in all the countries&#10;of the world.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;An old grandfather sat and told his little grandson all&#10;this about Holger Danske, and the boy knew that what his&#10;grandfather told him must be true. As the old man related this&#10;story, he was carving an image in wood to represent Holger Danske,&#10;to be fastened to the prow of a ship; for the old grandfather was a&#10;carver in wood, that is, one who carved figures for the heads of&#10;ships, according to the names given to them. And now he had carved&#10;Holger Danske, who stood there erect and proud, with his long&#10;beard, holding in one hand his broad battle-axe, while with the&#10;other he leaned on the Danish arms. The old grandfather told the&#10;little boy a great deal about Danish men and women who had&#10;distinguished themselves in olden times, so that he fancied he knew&#10;as much even as Holger Danske himself, who, after all, could only&#10;dream; and when the little fellow went to bed, he thought so much&#10;about it that he actually pressed his chin against the counterpane,&#10;and imagined that he had a long beard which had become rooted to&#10;it. But the old grandfather remained sitting at his work and&#10;carving away at the last part of it, which was the Danish arms. And&#10;when he had finished he looked at the whole figure, and thought of&#10;all he had heard and read, and what he had that evening related to&#10;his little grandson. Then he nodded his head, wiped his spectacles&#10;and put them on, and said, &#34;Ah, yes; Holger Danske will not appear&#10;in my lifetime, but the boy who is in bed there may very likely&#10;live to see him when the event really comes to pass.&#34; And the old&#10;grandfather nodded again; and the more he looked at Holger Danske,&#10;the more satisfied he felt that he had carved a good image of him.&#10;It seemed to glow with the color of life; the armor glittered like&#10;iron and steel. The hearts in the Danish arms grew more and more&#10;red; while the lions, with gold crowns on their heads, were leaping&#10;up. &#34;That is the most beautiful coat of arms in the world,&#34; said&#10;the old man. &#34;The lions represent strength; and the hearts,&#10;gentleness and love.&#34; And as he gazed on the uppermost lion, he&#10;thought of King Canute, who chained great England to Denmark&#39;s&#10;throne; and he looked at the second lion, and thought of Waldemar,&#10;who untied Denmark and conquered the Vandals. The third lion&#10;reminded him of Margaret, who united Denmark, Sweden, and Norway.&#10;But when he gazed at the red hearts, their colors glowed more&#10;deeply, even as flames, and his memory followed each in turn. The&#10;first led him to a dark, narrow prison, in which sat a prisoner, a&#10;beautiful woman, daughter of Christian the Fourth, Eleanor Ulfeld,&#10;and the flame became a rose on her bosom, and its blossoms were not&#10;more pure than the heart of this noblest and best of all Danish&#10;women. &#34;Ah, yes; that is indeed a noble heart in the Danish arms,&#34;&#10;said the grandfather. and his spirit followed the second flame,&#10;which carried him out to sea, where cannons roared and the ships&#10;lay shrouded in smoke, and the flaming heart attached itself to the&#10;breast of Hvitfeldt in the form of the ribbon of an order, as he&#10;blew himself and his ship into the air in order to save the fleet.&#10;And the third flame led him to Greenland&#39;s wretched huts, where the&#10;preacher, Hans Egede, ruled with love in every word and action. The&#10;flame was as a star on his breast, and added another heart to the&#10;Danish arms. And as the old grandfather&#39;s spirit followed the next&#10;hovering flame, he knew whither it would lead him. In a peasant&#10;woman&#39;s humble room stood Frederick the Sixth, writing his name&#10;with chalk on the beam. The flame trembled on his breast and in his&#10;heart, and it was in the peasant&#39;s room that his heart became one&#10;for the Danish arms. The old grandfather wiped his eyes, for he had&#10;known King Frederick, with his silvery locks and his honest blue&#10;eyes, and had lived for him, and he folded his hands and remained&#10;for some time silent. Then his daughter came to him and said it was&#10;getting late, that he ought to rest for a while, and that the&#10;supper was on the table.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What you have been carving is very beautiful,&#10;grandfather,&#34; said she. &#34;Holger Danske and the old coat of arms; it&#10;seems to me as if I have seen the face somewhere.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No, that is impossible,&#34; replied the old grandfather;&#10;&#34;but I have seen it, and I have tried to carve it in wood, as I&#10;have retained it in my memory. It was a long time ago, while the&#10;English fleet lay in the roads, on the second of April, when we&#10;showed that we were true, ancient Danes. I was on board the&#10;Denmark, in Steene Bille&#39;s squadron; I had a man by my side whom&#10;even the cannon balls seemed to fear. He sung old songs in a merry&#10;voice, and fired and fought as if he were something more than a&#10;man. I still remember his face, but from whence he came, or whither&#10;he went, I know not; no one knows. I have often thought it might&#10;have been Holger Danske himself, who had swam down to us from&#10;Kronenburg to help us in the hour of danger. That was my idea, and&#10;there stands his likeness.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The wooden figure threw a gigantic shadow on the wall, and&#10;even on part of the ceiling; it seemed as if the real Holger Danske&#10;stood behind it, for the shadow moved; but this was no doubt caused&#10;by the flame of the lamp not burning steadily. Then the&#10;daughter-in-law kissed the old grandfather, and led him to a large&#10;arm-chair by the table; and she, and her husband, who was the son&#10;of the old man and the father of the little boy who lay in bed, sat&#10;down to supper with him. And the old grandfather talked of the&#10;Danish lions and the Danish hearts, emblems of strength and&#10;gentleness, and explained quite clearly that there is another&#10;strength than that which lies in a sword, and he pointed to a shelf&#10;where lay a number of old books, and amongst them a collection of&#10;Holberg&#39;s plays, which are much read and are so clever and amusing&#10;that it is easy to fancy we have known the people of those days,&#10;who are described in them.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;He knew how to fight also,&#34; said the old man; &#34;for he&#10;lashed the follies and prejudices of people during his whole&#10;life.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the grandfather nodded to a place above the&#10;looking-glass, where hung an almanac, with a representation of the&#10;Round Tower upon it, and said &#34;Tycho Brahe was another of those who&#10;used a sword, but not one to cut into the flesh and bone, but to&#10;make the way of the stars of heaven clear, and plain to be&#10;understood. And then he whose father belonged to my calling,&#8212;yes,&#10;he, the son of the old image-carver, he whom we ourselves have&#10;seen, with his silvery locks and his broad shoulders, whose name is&#10;known in all lands;&#8212;yes, he was a sculptor, while I am only a&#10;carver. Holger Danske can appear in marble, so that people in all&#10;countries of the world may hear of the strength of Denmark. Now let&#10;us drink the health of Bertel.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But the little boy in bed saw plainly the old castle of&#10;Kronenburg, and the Sound of Elsinore, and Holger Danske, far down&#10;in the cellar, with his beard rooted to the table, and dreaming of&#10;everything that was passing above him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And Holger Danske did dream of the little humble room in&#10;which the image-carver sat; he heard all that had been said, and he&#10;nodded in his dream, saying, &#34;Ah, yes, remember me, you Danish&#10;people, keep me in your memory, I will come to you in the hour of&#10;need.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The bright morning light shone over Kronenburg, and the&#10;wind brought the sound of the hunting-horn across from the&#10;neighboring shores. The ships sailed by and saluted the castle with&#10;the boom of the cannon, and Kronenburg returned the salute, &#34;Boom,&#10;boom.&#34; But the roaring cannons did not awake Holger Danske, for&#10;they meant only &#34;Good morning,&#34; and &#34;Thank you.&#34; They must fire in&#10;another fashion before he awakes; but wake he will, for there is&#10;energy yet in Holger Danske. &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode(''), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;IN the forest that extends from the banks of the Gudenau,&#10;in North Jutland, a long way into the country, and not far from the&#10;clear stream, rises a great ridge of land, which stretches through&#10;the wood like a wall. Westward of this ridge, and not far from the&#10;river, stands a farmhouse, surrounded by such poor land that the&#10;sandy soil shows itself between the scanty ears of rye and wheat&#10;which grow in it. Some years have passed since the people who lived&#10;here cultivated these fields; they kept three sheep, a pig, and two&#10;oxen; in fact they maintained themselves very well, they had quite&#10;enough to live upon, as people generally have who are content with&#10;their lot. They even could have afforded to keep two horses, but it&#10;was a saying among the farmers in those parts, &#34;The horse eats&#10;himself up;&#34; that is to say, he eats as much as he earns. Jeppe&#10;Jans cultivated his fields in summer, and in the winter he made&#10;wooden shoes. He also had an assistant, a lad who understood as&#10;well as he himself did how to make wooden shoes strong, but light,&#10;and in the fashion. They carved shoes and spoons, which paid well;&#10;therefore no one could justly call Jeppe Jans and his family poor&#10;people. Little Ib, a boy of seven years old and the only child,&#10;would sit by, watching the workmen, or cutting a stick, and&#10;sometimes his finger instead of the stick. But one day Ib succeeded&#10;so well in his carving that he made two pieces of wood look really&#10;like two little wooden shoes, and he determined to give them as a&#10;present to Little Christina.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And who was Little Christina?&#34; She was the boatman&#39;s&#10;daughter, graceful and delicate as the child of a gentleman; had&#10;she been dressed differently, no one would have believed that she&#10;lived in a hut on the neighboring heath with her father. He was a&#10;widower, and earned his living by carrying firewood in his large&#10;boat from the forest to the eel-pond and eel-weir, on the estate of&#10;Silkborg, and sometimes even to the distant town of Randers. There&#10;was no one under whose care he could leave Little Christina; so she&#10;was almost always with him in his boat, or playing in the wood&#10;among the blossoming heath, or picking the ripe wild berries.&#10;Sometimes, when her father had to go as far as the town, he would&#10;take Little Christina, who was a year younger than Ib, across the&#10;heath to the cottage of Jeppe Jans, and leave her there. Ib and&#10;Christina agreed together in everything; they divided their bread&#10;and berries when they were hungry; they were partners in digging&#10;their little gardens; they ran, and crept, and played about&#10;everywhere. Once they wandered a long way into the forest, and even&#10;ventured together to climb the high ridge. Another time they found&#10;a few snipes&#39; eggs in the wood, which was a great event. Ib had&#10;never been on the heath where Christina&#39;s father lived, nor on the&#10;river; but at last came an opportunity. Christina&#39;s father invited&#10;him to go for a sail in his boat; and the evening before, he&#10;accompanied the boatman across the heath to his house. The next&#10;morning early, the two children were placed on the top of a high&#10;pile of firewood in the boat, and sat eating bread and wild&#10;strawberries, while Christina&#39;s father and his man drove the boat&#10;forward with poles. They floated on swiftly, for the tide was in&#10;their favor, passing over lakes, formed by the stream in its&#10;course; sometimes they seemed quite enclosed by reeds and&#10;water-plants, yet there was always room for them to pass out,&#10;although the old trees overhung the water and the old oaks&#10;stretched out their bare branches, as if they had turned up their&#10;sleeves and wished to show their knotty, naked arms. Old&#10;alder-trees, whose roots were loosened from the banks, clung with&#10;their fibres to the bottom of the stream, and the tops of the&#10;branches above the water looked like little woody islands. The&#10;water-lilies waved themselves to and fro on the river, everything&#10;made the excursion beautiful, and at last they came to the great&#10;eel-weir, where the water rushed through the flood-gates; and the&#10;children thought this a beautiful sight. In those days there was no&#10;factory nor any town house, nothing but the great farm, with its&#10;scanty-bearing fields, in which could be seen a few herd of cattle,&#10;and one or two farm laborers. The rushing of the water through the&#10;sluices, and the scream of the wild ducks, were almost the only&#10;signs of active life at Silkborg. After the firewood had been&#10;unloaded, Christina&#39;s father bought a whole bundle of eels and a&#10;sucking-pig, which were all placed in a basket in the stern of the&#10;boat. Then they returned again up the stream; and as the wind was&#10;favorable, two sails were hoisted, which carried the boat on as&#10;well as if two horses had been harnessed to it. As they sailed on,&#10;they came by chance to the place where the boatman&#39;s assistant&#10;lived, at a little distance from the bank of the river. The boat&#10;was moored; and the two men, after desiring the children to sit&#10;still, both went on shore. they obeyed this order for a very short&#10;time, and then forgot it altogether. First they peeped into the&#10;basket containing the eels and the sucking-pig; then they must&#10;needs pull out the pig and take it in their hands, and feel it, and&#10;touch it; and as they both wanted to hold it at the same time, the&#10;consequence was that they let it fall into the water, and the pig&#10;sailed away with the stream.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Here was a terrible disaster. Ib jumped ashore, and ran a&#10;little distance from the boat.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, take me with you,&#34; cried Christina; and she sprang&#10;after him. In a few minutes they found themselves deep in a&#10;thicket, and could no longer see the boat or the shore. They ran on&#10;a little farther, and then Christina fell down, and began to&#10;cry.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Ib helped her up, and said, &#34;Never mind; follow me. Yonder&#10;is the house.&#34; But the house was not yonder; and they wandered&#10;still farther, over the dry rustling leaves of the last year, and&#10;treading on fallen branches that crackled under their little feet;&#10;then they heard a loud, piercing cry, and they stood still to&#10;listen. Presently the scream of an eagle sounded through the wood;&#10;it was an ugly cry, and it frightened the children; but before&#10;them, in the thickest part of the forest, grew the most beautiful&#10;blackberries, in wonderful quantities. They looked so inviting that&#10;the children could not help stopping; and they remained there so&#10;long eating, that their mouths and cheeks became quite black with&#10;the juice.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Presently they heard the frightful scream again, and&#10;Christina said, &#34;We shall get into trouble about that&#10;pig.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, never mind,&#34; said Ib; &#34;we will go home to my father&#39;s&#10;house. It is here in the wood.&#34; So they went on, but the road led&#10;them out of the way; no house could be seen, it grew dark, and the&#10;children were afraid. The solemn stillness that reigned around them&#10;was now and then broken by the shrill cries of the great horned owl&#10;and other birds that they knew nothing of. At last they both lost&#10;themselves in the thicket; Christina began to cry, and then Ib&#10;cried too; and, after weeping and lamenting for some time, they&#10;stretched themselves down on the dry leaves and fell&#10;asleep.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The sun was high in the heavens when the two children&#10;woke. They felt cold; but not far from their resting-place, on a&#10;hill, the sun was shining through the trees. They thought if they&#10;went there they should be warm, and Ib fancied he should be able to&#10;see his father&#39;s house from such a high spot. But they were far&#10;away from home now, in quite another part of the forest. They&#10;clambered to the top of the rising ground, and found themselves on&#10;the edge of a declivity, which sloped down to a clear transparent&#10;lake. Great quantities of fish could be seen through the clear&#10;water, sparkling in the sun&#39;s rays; they were quite surprised when&#10;they came so suddenly upon such an unexpected sight.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Close to where they stood grew a hazel-bush, covered with&#10;beautiful nuts. They soon gathered some, cracked them, and ate the&#10;fine young kernels, which were only just ripe. But there was&#10;another surprise and fright in store for them. Out of the thicket&#10;stepped a tall old woman, her face quite brown, and her hair of a&#10;deep shining black; the whites of her eyes glittered like a Moor&#39;s;&#10;on her back she carried a bundle, and in her hand a knotted stick.&#10;She was a gypsy. The children did not at first understand what she&#10;said. She drew out of her pocket three large nuts, in which she&#10;told them were hidden the most beautiful and lovely things in the&#10;world, for they were wishing nuts. Ib looked at her, and as she&#10;spoke so kindly, he took courage, and asked her if she would give&#10;him the nuts; and the woman gave them to him, and then gathered&#10;some more from the bushes for herself, quite a pocket full. Ib and&#10;Christina looked at the wishing nuts with wide open&#10;eyes.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Is there in this nut a carriage, with a pair of horses?&#34;&#10;asked Ib.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, there is a golden carriage, with two golden horses,&#34;&#10;replied the woman.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Then give me that nut,&#34; said Christina; so Ib gave it to&#10;her, and the strange woman tied up the nut for her in her&#10;handkerchief.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Ib held up another nut. &#34;Is there, in this nut, a pretty&#10;little neckerchief like the one Christina has on her neck?&#34; asked&#10;Ib.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;There are ten neckerchiefs in it,&#34; she replied, &#34;as well&#10;as beautiful dresses, stockings, and a hat and veil.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Then I will have that one also,&#34; said Christina; &#34;and it&#10;is a pretty one too. And then Ib gave her the second&#10;nut.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The third was a little black thing. &#34;You may keep that&#10;one,&#34; said Christina; &#34;it is quite as pretty.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What is in it?&#34; asked Ib.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The best of all things for you,&#34; replied the gypsy. So Ib&#10;held the nut very tight.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the woman promised to lead the children to the right&#10;path, that they might find their way home: and they went forward&#10;certainly in quite another direction to the one they meant to take;&#10;therefore no one ought to speak against the woman, and say that she&#10;wanted to steal the children. In the wild wood-path they met a&#10;forester who knew Ib, and, by his help, Ib and Christina reached&#10;home, where they found every one had been very anxious about them.&#10;They were pardoned and forgiven, although they really had both done&#10;wrong, and deserved to get into trouble; first, because they had&#10;let the sucking-pig fall into the water; and, secondly, because&#10;they had run away. Christina was taken back to her father&#39;s house&#10;on the heath, and Ib remained in the farm-house on the borders of&#10;the wood, near the great land ridge.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The first thing Ib did that evening was to take out of his&#10;pocket the little black nut, in which the best thing of all was&#10;said to be enclosed. He laid it carefully between the door and the&#10;door-post, and then shut the door so that the nut cracked directly.&#10;But there was not much kernel to be seen; it was what we should&#10;call hollow or worm-eaten, and looked as if it had been filled with&#10;tobacco or rich black earth. &#34;It is just what I expected!&#34;&#10;exclaimed Ib. &#34;How should there be room in a little nut like this&#10;for the best thing of all? Christina will find her two nuts just&#10;the same; there will be neither fine clothes or a golden carriage&#10;in them.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Winter came; and the new year, and indeed many years&#10;passed away; until Ib was old enough to be confirmed, and,&#10;therefore, he went during a whole winter to the clergyman of the&#10;nearest village to be prepared.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;One day, about this time, the boatman paid a visit to Ib&#39;s&#10;parents, and told them that Christina was going to service, and&#10;that she had been remarkably fortunate in obtaining a good place,&#10;with most respectable people. &#34;Only think,&#34; he said, &#34;She is going&#10;to the rich innkeeper&#39;s, at the hotel in Herning, many miles west&#10;from here. She is to assist the landlady in the housekeeping; and,&#10;if afterwards she behaves well and remains to be confirmed, the&#10;people will treat her as their own daughter.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;So Ib and Christina took leave of each other. People&#10;already called them &#34;the betrothed,&#34; and at parting the girl showed&#10;Ib the two nuts, which she had taken care of ever since the time&#10;that they lost themselves in the wood; and she told him also that&#10;the little wooden shoes he once carved for her when he was a boy,&#10;and gave her as a present, had been carefully kept in a drawer ever&#10;since. And so they parted.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;After Ib&#39;s confirmation, he remained at home with his&#10;mother, for he had become a clever shoemaker, and in summer managed&#10;the farm for her quite alone. His father had been dead some time,&#10;and his mother kept no farm servants. Sometimes, but very seldom,&#10;he heard of Christina, through a postillion or eel-seller who was&#10;passing. But she was well off with the rich innkeeper; and after&#10;being confirmed she wrote a letter to her father, in which was a&#10;kind message to Ib and his mother. In this letter, she mentioned&#10;that her master and mistress had made her a present of a beautiful&#10;new dress, and some nice under-clothes. This was, of course,&#10;pleasant news.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;One day, in the following spring, there came a knock at&#10;the door of the house where Ib&#39;s old mother lived; and when they&#10;opened it, lo and behold, in stepped the boatman and Christina. She&#10;had come to pay them a visit, and to spend the day. A carriage had&#10;to come from the Herning hotel to the next village, and she had&#10;taken the opportunity to see her friends once more. She looked as&#10;elegant as a real lady, and wore a pretty dress, beautifully made&#10;on purpose for her. There she stood, in full dress, while Ib wore&#10;only his working clothes. He could not utter a word; he could only&#10;seize her hand and hold it fast in his own, but he felt too happy&#10;and glad to open his lips. Christina, however, was quite at her&#10;ease; she talked and talked, and kissed him in the most friendly&#10;manner. Even afterwards, when they were left alone, and she asked,&#10;&#34;Did you know me again, Ib?&#34; he still stood holding her hand, and&#10;said at last, &#34;You are become quite a grand lady, Christina, and I&#10;am only a rough working man; but I have often thought of you and of&#10;old times.&#34; Then they wandered up the great ridge, and looked&#10;across the stream to the heath, where the little hills were covered&#10;with the flowering broom. Ib said nothing; but before the time came&#10;for them to part, it became quite clear to him that Christina must&#10;be his wife: had they not even in childhood been called the&#10;betrothed? To him it seemed as if they were really engaged to each&#10;other, although not a word had been spoken on the subject. They had&#10;only a few more hours to remain together, for Christina was obliged&#10;to return that evening to the neighboring village, to be ready for&#10;the carriage which was to start the next morning early for Herning.&#10;Ib and her father accompanied her to the village. It was a fine&#10;moonlight evening; and when they arrived, Ib stood holding&#10;Christina&#39;s hand in his, as if he could not let her go. His eyes&#10;brightened, and the words he uttered came with hesitation from his&#10;lips, but from the deepest recesses of his heart: &#34;Christina, if&#10;you have not become too grand, and if you can be contented to live&#10;in my mother&#39;s house as my wife, we will be married some day. But&#10;we can wait for a while.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh yes,&#34; she replied; &#34;Let us wait a little longer, Ib. I&#10;can trust you, for I believe that I do love you. But let me think&#10;it over.&#34; Then he kissed her lips; and so they parted.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;On the way home, Ib told the boatman that he and Christina&#10;were as good as engaged to each other; and the boatman found out&#10;that he had always expected it would be so, and went home with Ib&#10;that evening, and remained the night in the farmhouse; but nothing&#10;further was said of the engagement. During the next year, two&#10;letters passed between Ib and Christina. They were signed,&#10;&#34;Faithful till death;&#34; but at the end of that time, one day the&#10;boatman came over to see Ib, with a kind greeting from Christina.&#10;He had something else to say, which made him hesitate in a strange&#10;manner. At last it came out that Christina, who had grown a very&#10;pretty girl, was more lucky than ever. She was courted and admired&#10;by every one; but her master&#39;s son, who had been home on a visit,&#10;was so much pleased with Christina that he wished to marry her. He&#10;had a very good situation in an office at Copenhagen, and as she&#10;had also taken a liking for him, his parents were not unwilling to&#10;consent. But Christina, in her heart, often thought of Ib, and knew&#10;how much he thought of her; so she felt inclined to refuse this&#10;good fortune, added the boatman. At first Ib said not a word, but&#10;he became as white as the wall, and shook his head gently, and then&#10;he spoke,&#8212;&#34;Christina must not refuse this good fortune.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Then will you write a few words to her?&#34; said the&#10;boatman.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Ib sat down to write, but he could not get on at all. The&#10;words were not what he wished to say, so he tore up the page. The&#10;following morning, however, a letter lay ready to be sent to&#10;Christina, and the following is what he wrote:&#8212;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The letter written by you to your father I have read, and&#10;see from it that you are prosperous in everything, and that still&#10;better fortune is in store for you. Ask your own heart, Christina,&#10;and think over carefully what awaits you if you take me for your&#10;husband, for I possess very little in the world. Do not think of me&#10;or of my position; think only of your own welfare. You are bound to&#10;me by no promises; and if in your heart you have given me one, I&#10;release you from it. May every blessing and happiness be poured out&#10;upon you, Christina. Heaven will give me the heart&#39;s&#10;consolation.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Ever your sincere friend, IB.&#34;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;This letter was sent, and Christina received it in due&#10;time. In the course of the following November, her banns were&#10;published in the church on the heath, and also in Copenhagen, where&#10;the bridegroom lived. She was taken to Copenhagen under the&#10;protection of her future mother-in-law, because the bridegroom&#10;could not spare time from his numerous occupations for a journey so&#10;far into Jutland. On the journey, Christina met her father at one&#10;of the villages through which they passed, and here he took leave&#10;of her. Very little was said about the matter to Ib, and he did not&#10;refer to it; his mother, however, noticed that he had grown very&#10;silent and pensive. Thinking as he did of old times, no wonder the&#10;three nuts came into his mind which the gypsy woman had given him&#10;when a child, and of the two which he had given to Christina. These&#10;wishing nuts, after all, had proved true fortune-tellers. One had&#10;contained a gilded carriage and noble horses, and the other&#10;beautiful clothes; all of these Christina would now have in her new&#10;home at Copenhagen. Her part had come true. And for him the nut had&#10;contained only black earth. The gypsy woman had said it was the&#10;best for him. Perhaps it was, and this also would be fulfilled. He&#10;understood the gypsy woman&#39;s meaning now. The black earth&#8212;the dark&#10;grave&#8212;was the best thing for him now.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Again years passed away; not many, but they seemed long&#10;years to Ib. The old innkeeper and his wife died one after the&#10;other; and the whole of their property, many thousand dollars, was&#10;inherited by their son. Christina could have the golden carriage&#10;now, and plenty of fine clothes. During the two long years which&#10;followed, no letter came from Christina to her father; and when at&#10;last her father received one from her, it did not speak of&#10;prosperity or happiness. Poor Christina! Neither she nor her&#10;husband understood how to economize or save, and the riches brought&#10;no blessing with them, because they had not asked for&#10;it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Years passed; and for many summers the heath was covered&#10;with bloom; in winter the snow rested upon it, and the rough winds&#10;blew across the ridge under which stood Ib&#39;s sheltered home. One&#10;spring day the sun shone brightly, and he was guiding the plough&#10;across his field. The ploughshare struck against something which he&#10;fancied was a firestone, and then he saw glittering in the earth a&#10;splinter of shining metal which the plough had cut from something&#10;which gleamed brightly in the furrow. He searched, and found a&#10;large golden armlet of superior workmanship, and it was evident&#10;that the plough had disturbed a Hun&#39;s grave. He searched further,&#10;and found more valuable treasures, which Ib showed to the&#10;clergyman, who explained their value to him. Then he went to the&#10;magistrate, who informed the president of the museum of the&#10;discovery, and advised Ib to take the treasures himself to the&#10;president.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You have found in the earth the best thing you could&#10;find,&#34; said the magistrate.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The best thing,&#34; thought Ib; &#34;the very best thing for&#10;me,&#8212;and found in the earth! Well, if it really is so, then the&#10;gypsy woman was right in her prophecy.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;So Ib went in the ferry-boat from Aarhus to Copenhagen. To&#10;him who had only sailed once or twice on the river near his own&#10;home, this seemed like a voyage on the ocean; and at length he&#10;arrived at Copenhagen. The value of the gold he had found was paid&#10;to him; it was a large sum&#8212;six hundred dollars. Then Ib of the&#10;heath went out, and wandered about in the great city.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;On the evening before the day he had settled to return&#10;with the captain of the passage-boat, Ib lost himself in the&#10;streets, and took quite a different turning to the one he wished to&#10;follow. He wandered on till he found himself in a poor street of&#10;the suburb called Christian&#39;s Haven. Not a creature could be seen.&#10;At last a very little girl came out of one of the wretched-looking&#10;houses, and Ib asked her to tell him the way to the street he&#10;wanted; she looked up timidly at him, and began to cry bitterly. He&#10;asked her what was the matter; but what she said he could not&#10;understand. So he went along the street with her; and as they&#10;passed under a lamp, the light fell on the little girl&#39;s face. A&#10;strange sensation came over Ib, as he caught sight of it. The&#10;living, breathing embodiment of Little Christina stood before him,&#10;just as he remembered her in the days of her childhood. He followed&#10;the child to the wretched house, and ascended the narrow, crazy&#10;staircase which led to a little garret in the roof. The air in the&#10;room was heavy and stifling, no light was burning, and from one&#10;corner came sounds of moaning and sighing. It was the mother of the&#10;child who lay there on a miserable bed. With the help of a match,&#10;Ib struck a light, and approached her.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Can I be of any service to you?&#34; he asked. &#34;This little&#10;girl brought me up here; but I am a stranger in this city. Are&#10;there no neighbors or any one whom I can call?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then he raised the head of the sick woman, and smoothed&#10;her pillow. He started as he did so. It was Christina of the heath!&#10;No one had mentioned her name to Ib for years; it would have&#10;disturbed his peace of mind, especially as the reports respecting&#10;her were not good. The wealth which her husband had inherited from&#10;his parents had made him proud and arrogant. He had given up his&#10;certain appointment, and travelled for six months in foreign lands,&#10;and, on his return, had lived in great style, and got into terrible&#10;debt. For a time he had trembled on the high pedestal on which he&#10;had placed himself, till at last he toppled over, and ruin came.&#10;His numerous merry companions, and the visitors at his table, said&#10;it served him right, for he had kept house like a madman. One&#10;morning his corpse was found in the canal. The cold hand of death&#10;had already touched the heart of Christina. Her youngest child,&#10;looked for in the midst of prosperity, had sunk into the grave when&#10;only a few weeks old; and at last Christina herself became sick&#10;unto death, and lay, forsaken and dying, in a miserable room, amid&#10;poverty she might have borne in her younger days, but which was now&#10;more painful to her from the luxuries to which she had lately been&#10;accustomed. It was her eldest child, also a Little Christina, whom&#10;Ib had followed to her home, where she suffered hunger and poverty&#10;with her mother.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It makes me unhappy to think that I shall die, and leave&#10;this poor child,&#34; sighed she. &#34;Oh, what will become of her?&#34; She&#10;could say no more.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then Ib brought out another match, and lighted a piece of&#10;candle which he found in the room, and it threw a glimmering light&#10;over the wretched dwelling. Ib looked at the little girl, and&#10;thought of Christina in her young days. For her sake, could he not&#10;love this child, who was a stranger to him? As he thus reflected,&#10;the dying woman opened her eyes, and gazed at him. Did she&#10;recognize him? He never knew; for not another word escaped her&#10;lips.&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;hr /&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the forest by the river Gudenau, not far from the&#10;heath, and beneath the ridge of land, stood the little farm, newly&#10;painted and whitewashed. The air was heavy and dark; there were no&#10;blossoms on the heath; the autumn winds whirled the yellow leaves&#10;towards the boatman&#39;s hut, in which strangers dwelt; but the little&#10;farm stood safely sheltered beneath the tall trees and the high&#10;ridge. The turf blazed brightly on the hearth, and within was&#10;sunlight, the sparkling light from the sunny eyes of a child; the&#10;birdlike tones from the rosy lips ringing like the song of a lark&#10;in spring. All was life and joy. Little Christina sat on Ib&#39;s knee.&#10;Ib was to her both father and mother; her own parents had vanished&#10;from her memory, as a dream-picture vanishes alike from childhood&#10;and age. Ib&#39;s house was well and prettily furnished; for he was a&#10;prosperous man now, while the mother of the little girl rested in&#10;the churchyard at Copenhagen, where she had died in poverty. Ib had&#10;money now&#8212;money which had come to him out of the black earth; and&#10;he had Christina for his own, after all. &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('Little Rudy'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;WE will pay a visit to Switzerland, and wander through&#10;that country of mountains, whose steep and rocky sides are&#10;overgrown with forest trees. Let us climb to the dazzling&#10;snow-fields at their summits, and descend again to the green&#10;meadows beneath, through which rivers and brooks rush along as if&#10;they could not quickly enough reach the sea and vanish. Fiercely&#10;shines the sun over those deep valleys, as well as upon the heavy&#10;masses of snow which lie on the mountains.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;During the year these accumulations thaw or fall in the&#10;rolling avalance, or are piled up in shining glaciers. Two of these&#10;glaciers lie in the broad, rocky cliffs, between the Schreckhorn&#10;and the Wetterhorn, near the little town of Grindelwald. They are&#10;wonderful to behold, and therefore in the summer time strangers&#10;come here from all parts of the world to see them. They cross&#10;snow-covered mountains, and travel through the deep valleys, or&#10;ascend for hours, higher and still higher, the valleys appearing to&#10;sink lower and lower as they proceed, and become as small as if&#10;seen from an air balloon. Over the lofty summits of these mountains&#10;the clouds often hang like a dark veil; while beneath in the&#10;valley, where many brown, wooden houses are scattered about, the&#10;bright rays of the sun may be shining upon a little brilliant patch&#10;of green, making it appear almost transparent. The waters foam and&#10;dash along in the valleys beneath; the streams from above trickle&#10;and murmur as they fall down the rocky mountain&#39;s side, looking&#10;like glittering silver bands.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;On both sides of the mountain-path stand these little&#10;wooden houses; and, as within, there are many children and many&#10;mouths to feed, each house has its own little potato garden. These&#10;children rush out in swarms, and surround travellers, whether on&#10;foot or in carriages. They are all clever at making a bargain. They&#10;offer for sale the sweetest little toy-houses, models of the&#10;mountain cottages in Switzerland. Whether it be rain or sunshine,&#10;these crowds of children are always to be seen with their&#10;wares.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;About twenty years ago, there might be seen occasionally,&#10;standing at a short distance from the other children, a little boy,&#10;who was also anxious to sell his curious wares. He had an earnest,&#10;expressive countenance, and held the box containing his carved toys&#10;tightly with both hands, as if unwilling to part with it. His&#10;earnest look, and being also a very little boy, made him noticed by&#10;the strangers; so that he often sold the most, without knowing why.&#10;An hour&#39;s walk farther up the ascent lived his grandfather, who cut&#10;and carved the pretty little toy-houses; and in the old man&#39;s room&#10;stood a large press, full of all sorts of carved&#10;things&#8212;nut-crackers, knives and forks, boxes with beautifully&#10;carved foliage, leaping chamois. It contained everything that could&#10;delight the eyes of a child. But the boy, who was named Rudy,&#10;looked with still greater pleasure and longing at some old&#10;fire-arms which hung upon the rafters, under the ceiling of the&#10;room. His grandfather promised him that he should have them some&#10;day, but that he must first grow big and strong, and learn how to&#10;use them. Small as he was, the goats were placed in his care, and a&#10;good goat-keeper should also be a good climber, and such Rudy was;&#10;he sometimes, indeed, climbed higher than the goats, for he was&#10;fond of seeking for birds&#39;-nests at the top of high trees; he was&#10;bold and daring, but was seldom seen to smile, excepting when he&#10;stood by the roaring cataract, or heard the descending roll of the&#10;avalanche. He never played with the other children, and was not&#10;seen with them, unless his grandfather sent him down to sell his&#10;curious workmanship. Rudy did not much like trade; he loved to&#10;climb the mountains, or to sit by his grandfather and listen to his&#10;tales of olden times, or of the people in Meyringen, the place of&#10;his birth.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;In the early ages of the world,&#34; said the old man, &#34;these&#10;people could not be found in Switzerland. They are a colony from&#10;the north, where their ancestors still dwell, and are called&#10;Swedes.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;This was something for Rudy to know, but he learnt more&#10;from other sources, particularly from the domestic animals who&#10;belonged to the house. One was a large dog, called Ajola, which had&#10;belonged to his father; and the other was a tom-cat. This cat stood&#10;very high in Rudy&#39;s favor, for he had taught him to&#10;climb.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Come out on the roof with me,&#34; said the cat; and Rudy&#10;quite understood him, for the language of fowls, ducks, cats, and&#10;dogs, is as easily understood by a young child as his own native&#10;tongue. But it must be at the age when grandfather&#39;s stick becomes&#10;a neighing horse, with head, legs, and tail. Some children retain&#10;these ideas later than others, and they are considered backwards&#10;and childish for their age. People say so; but is it so?&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Come out on the roof with me, little Rudy,&#34; was the first&#10;thing he heard the cat say, and Rudy understood him. &#34;What people&#10;say about falling down is all nonsense,&#34; continued the cat; &#34;you&#10;will not fall, unless you are afraid. Come, now, set one foot here&#10;and another there, and feel your way with your fore-feet. Keep your&#10;eyes wide open, and move softly, and if you come to a hole jump&#10;over it, and cling fast as I do.&#34; And this was just what Rudy did.&#10;He was often on the sloping roof with the cat, or on the tops of&#10;high trees. But, more frequently, higher still on the ridges of the&#10;rocks where puss never came.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Higher, higher!&#34; cried the trees and the bushes, &#34;see to&#10;what height we have grown, and how fast we hold, even to the narrow&#10;edges of the rocks.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Rudy often reached the top of the mountain before the&#10;sunrise, and there inhaled his morning draught of the fresh,&#10;invigorating mountain air,&#8212;God&#39;s own gift, which men call the sweet&#10;fragrance of plant and herb on the mountain-side, and the mint and&#10;wild thyme in the valleys. The overhanging clouds absorb all&#10;heaviness from the air, and the winds convey them away over the&#10;pine-tree summits. The spirit of fragrance, light and fresh,&#10;remained behind, and this was Rudy&#39;s morning draught. The&#10;sunbeams&#8212;those blessing-bringing daughters of the sun&#8212;kissed his&#10;cheeks. Vertigo might be lurking on the watch, but he dared not&#10;approach him. The swallows, who had not less than seven nests in&#10;his grandfather&#39;s house, flew up to him and his goats, singing, &#34;We&#10;and you, you and we.&#34; They brought him greetings from his&#10;grandfather&#39;s house, even from two hens, the only birds of the&#10;household; but Rudy was not intimate with them.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Although so young and such a little fellow, Rudy had&#10;travelled a great deal. He was born in the canton of Valais, and&#10;brought to his grandfather over the mountains. He had walked to&#10;Staubbach&#8212;a little town that seems to flutter in the air like a&#10;silver veil&#8212;the glittering, snow-clad mountain Jungfrau. He had&#10;also been to the great glaciers; but this is connected with a sad&#10;story, for here his mother met her death, and his grandfather used&#10;to say that all Rudy&#39;s childish merriment was lost from that time.&#10;His mother had written in a letter, that before he was a year old&#10;he had laughed more than he cried; but after his fall into the&#10;snow-covered crevasse, his disposition had completely changed. The&#10;grandfather seldom spoke of this, but the fact was generally known.&#10;Rudy&#39;s father had been a postilion, and the large dog which now&#10;lived in his grandfather&#39;s cottage had always followed him on his&#10;journeys over the Simplon to the lake of Geneva. Rudy&#39;s relations,&#10;on his father&#39;s side, lived in the canton of Valais, in the valley&#10;of the Rhone. His uncle was a chamois hunter, and a well-known&#10;guide. Rudy was only a year old when his father died, and his&#10;mother was anxious to return with her child to her own relations,&#10;who lived in the Bernese Oberland. Her father dwelt at a few hours&#39;&#10;distance from Grindelwald; he was a carver in wood, and gained so&#10;much by it that he had plenty to live upon. She set out homewards&#10;in the month of June, carrying her infant in her arms, and,&#10;accompanied by two chamois hunters, crossed the Gemmi on her way to&#10;Grindelwald. They had already left more than half the journey&#10;behind them. They had crossed high ridges, and traversed&#10;snow-fields; they could even see her native valley, with its&#10;familiar wooden cottages. They had only one more glacier to climb.&#10;Some newly fallen snow concealed a cleft which, though it did not&#10;extend to the foaming waters in the depths beneath, was still much&#10;deeper than the height of a man. The young woman, with the child in&#10;her arms, slipped upon it, sank in, and disappeared. Not a shriek,&#10;not a groan was heard; nothing but the whining of a little child.&#10;More than an hour elapsed before her two companions could obtain&#10;from the nearest house ropes and poles to assist in raising them;&#10;and it was with much exertion that they at last succeeded in&#10;raising from the crevasse what appeared to be two dead bodies.&#10;Every means was used to restore them to life. With the child they&#10;were successful, but not with the mother; so the old grandfather&#10;received his daughter&#39;s little son into his house an orphan,&#8212;a&#10;little boy who laughed more than he cried; but it seemed as if&#10;laughter had left him in the cold ice-world into which he had&#10;fallen, where, as the Swiss peasants say, the souls of the lost are&#10;confined till the judgment-day.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The glaciers appear as if a rushing stream had been frozen&#10;in its course, and pressed into blocks of green crystal, which,&#10;balanced one upon another, form a wondrous palace of crystal for&#10;the Ice Maiden&#8212;the queen of the glaciers. It is she whose mighty&#10;power can crush the traveller to death, and arrest the flowing&#10;river in its course. She is also a child of the air, and with the&#10;swiftness of the chamois she can reach the snow-covered mountain&#10;tops, where the boldest mountaineer has to cut footsteps in the ice&#10;to ascend. She will sail on a frail pine-twig over the raging&#10;torrents beneath, and spring lightly from one iceberg to another,&#10;with her long, snow-white hair flowing around her, and her&#10;dark-green robe glittering like the waters of the deep Swiss lakes.&#10;&#34;Mine is the power to seize and crush,&#34; she cried. &#34;Once a&#10;beautiful boy was stolen from me by man,&#8212;a boy whom I had kissed,&#10;but had not kissed to death. He is again among mankind, and tends&#10;the goats on the mountains. He is always climbing higher and&#10;higher, far away from all others, but not from me. He is mine; I&#10;will send for him.&#34; And she gave Vertigo the commission.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was summer, and the Ice Maiden was melting amidst the&#10;green verdure, when Vertigo swung himself up and down. Vertigo has&#10;many brothers, quite a troop of them, and the Ice Maiden chose the&#10;strongest among them. They exercise their power in different ways,&#10;and everywhere. Some sit on the banisters of steep stairs, others&#10;on the outer rails of lofty towers, or spring like squirrels along&#10;the ridges of the mountains. Others tread the air as a swimmer&#10;treads the water, and lure their victims here and there till they&#10;fall into the deep abyss. Vertigo and the Ice Maiden clutch at&#10;human beings, as the polypus seizes upon all that comes within its&#10;reach. And now Vertigo was to seize Rudy.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Seize him, indeed,&#34; cried Vertigo; &#34;I cannot do it. That&#10;monster of a cat has taught him her tricks. That child of the human&#10;race has a power within him which keeps me at a distance; I cannot&#10;possibly reach the boy when he hangs from the branches of trees,&#10;over the precipice; or I would gladly tickle his feet, and send him&#10;heels over head through the air; but I cannot accomplish&#10;it.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;We must accomplish it,&#34; said the Ice Maiden; &#34;either you&#10;or I must; and I will&#8212;I will!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No, no!&#34; sounded through the air, like an echo on the&#10;mountain church bells chime. It was an answer in song, in the&#10;melting tones of a chorus from others of nature&#39;s spirits&#8212;good and&#10;loving spirits, the daughters of the sunbeam. They who place&#10;themselves in a circle every evening on the mountain peaks; there&#10;they spread out their rose-colored wings, which, as the sun sinks,&#10;become more flaming red, until the lofty Alps seem to burn with&#10;fire. Men call this the Alpine glow. After the sun has set, they&#10;disappear within the white snow on the mountain-tops, and slumber&#10;there till sunrise, when they again come forth. They have great&#10;love for flowers, for butterflies, and for mankind; and from among&#10;the latter they had chosen little Rudy. &#34;You shall not catch him;&#10;you shall not seize him!&#34; they sang.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Greater and stronger than he have I seized!&#34; said the Ice&#10;Maiden.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the daughters of the sun sang a song of the&#10;traveller, whose cloak had been carried away by the wind. &#34;The wind&#10;took the covering, but not the man; it could even seize upon him,&#10;but not hold him fast. The children of strength are more powerful,&#10;more ethereal, even than we are. They can rise higher than our&#10;parent, the sun. They have the magic words that rule the wind and&#10;the waves, and compel them to serve and obey; and they can, at&#10;last, cast off the heavy, oppressive weight of mortality, and soar&#10;upwards.&#34; Thus sweetly sounded the bell-like tones of the&#10;chorus.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And each morning the sun&#39;s rays shone through the one&#10;little window of the grandfather&#39;s house upon the quiet child. The&#10;daughters of the sunbeam kissed him; they wished to thaw, and melt,&#10;and obliterate the ice kiss which the queenly maiden of the&#10;glaciers had given him as he lay in the lap of his dead mother, in&#10;the deep crevasse of ice from which he had been so wonderfully&#10;rescued.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('The Journey to the New Home'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Rudy was just eight years old, when his uncle, who lived&#10;on the other side of the mountain, wished to have the boy, as he&#10;thought he might obtain a better education with him, and learn&#10;something more. His grandfather thought the same, so he consented&#10;to let him go. Rudy had many to say farewell to, as well as his&#10;grandfather. First, there was Ajola, the old dog.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Your father was the postilion, and I was the postilion&#39;s&#10;dog,&#34; said Ajola. &#34;We have often travelled the same journey&#10;together; I knew all the dogs and men on this side of the mountain.&#10;It is not my habit to talk much; but now that we have so little&#10;time to converse together, I will say something more than usual. I&#10;will relate to you a story, which I have reflected upon for a long&#10;time. I do not understand it, and very likely you will not, but&#10;that is of no consequence. I have, however, learnt from it that in&#10;this world things are not equally divided, neither for dogs nor for&#10;men. All are not born to lie on the lap and to drink milk: I have&#10;never been petted in this way, but I have seen a little dog seated&#10;in the place of a gentleman or lady, and travelling inside a&#10;post-chaise. The lady, who was his mistress, or of whom he was&#10;master, carried a bottle of milk, of which the little dog now and&#10;then drank; she also offered him pieces of sugar to crunch. He&#10;sniffed at them proudly, but would not eat one, so she ate them&#10;herself. I was running along the dirty road by the side of the&#10;carriage as hungry as a dog could be, chewing the cud of my own&#10;thoughts, which were rather in confusion. But many other things&#10;seemed in confusion also. Why was not I lying on a lap and&#10;travelling in a coach? I could not tell; yet I knew I could not&#10;alter my own condition, either by barking or growling.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;This was Ajola&#39;s farewell speech, and Rudy threw his arms&#10;round the dog&#39;s neck and kissed his cold nose. Then he took the cat&#10;in his arms, but he struggled to get free.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You are getting too strong for me,&#34; he said; &#34;but I will&#10;not use my claws against you. Clamber away over the mountains; it&#10;was I who taught you to climb. Do not fancy you are going to fall,&#10;and you will be quite safe.&#34; Then the cat jumped down and ran away;&#10;he did not wish Rudy to see that there were tears in his&#10;eyes.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The hens were hopping about the floor; one of them had no&#10;tail; a traveller, who fancied himself a sportsman, had shot off&#10;her tail, he had mistaken her for a bird of prey.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Rudy is going away over the mountains,&#34; said one of the&#10;hens.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;He is always in such a hurry,&#34; said the other; &#34;and I&#10;don&#39;t like taking leave,&#34; so they both hopped out.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But the goats said farewell; they bleated and wanted to go&#10;with him, they were so very sorry.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Just at this time two clever guides were going to cross&#10;the mountains to the other side of the Gemmi, and Rudy was to go&#10;with them on foot. It was a long walk for such a little boy, but he&#10;had plenty of strength and invincible courage. The swallows flew&#10;with him a little way, singing, &#34;We and you&#8212;you and we.&#34; The way&#10;led across the rushing Lutschine, which falls in numerous streams&#10;from the dark clefts of the Grindelwald glaciers. Trunks of fallen&#10;trees and blocks of stone form bridges over these streams. After&#10;passing a forest of alders, they began to ascend, passing by some&#10;blocks of ice that had loosened themselves from the side of the&#10;mountain and lay across their path; they had to step over these&#10;ice-blocks or walk round them. Rudy crept here and ran there, his&#10;eyes sparkling with joy, and he stepped so firmly with his&#10;iron-tipped mountain shoe, that he left a mark behind him wherever&#10;he placed his foot.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The earth was black where the mountain torrents or the&#10;melted ice had poured upon it, but the bluish green, glassy ice&#10;sparkled and glittered. They had to go round little pools, like&#10;lakes, enclosed between large masses of ice; and, while thus&#10;wandering out of their path, they came near an immense stone, which&#10;lay balanced on the edge of an icy peak. The stone lost its balance&#10;just as they reached it, and rolled over into the abyss beneath,&#10;while the noise of its fall was echoed back from every hollow cliff&#10;of the glaciers.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;They were always going upwards. The glaciers seemed to&#10;spread above them like a continued chain of masses of ice, piled up&#10;in wild confusion between bare and rugged rocks. Rudy thought for a&#10;moment of what had been told him, that he and his mother had once&#10;lain buried in one of these cold, heart-chilling fissures; but he&#10;soon banished such thoughts, and looked upon the story as fabulous,&#10;like many other stories which had been told him. Once or twice,&#10;when the men thought the way was rather difficult for such a little&#10;boy, they held out their hands to assist him; but he would not&#10;accept their assistance, for he stood on the slippery ice as firmly&#10;as if he had been a chamois. They came at length to rocky ground;&#10;sometimes stepping upon moss-covered stones, sometimes passing&#10;beneath stunted fir-trees, and again through green meadows. The&#10;landscape was always changing, but ever above them towered the&#10;lofty snow-clad mountains, whose names not only Rudy but every&#10;other child knew&#8212;&#34;The Jungfrau,&#34; &#34;The Monk and the&#10;Eiger.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Rudy had never been so far away before; he had never&#10;trodden on the wide-spreading ocean of snow that lay here with its&#10;immovable billows, from which the wind blows off the snowflake now&#10;and then, as it cuts the foam from the waves of the sea. The&#10;glaciers stand here so close together it might almost be said they&#10;are hand-in-hand; and each is a crystal palace for the Ice Maiden,&#10;whose power and will it is to seize and imprison the unwary&#10;traveller.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The sun shone warmly, and the snow sparkled as if covered&#10;with glittering diamonds. Numerous insects, especially butterflies&#10;and bees, lay dead in heaps on the snow. They had ventured too&#10;high, or the wind had carried them here and left them to die of&#10;cold.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Around the Wetterhorn hung a feathery cloud, like a&#10;woolbag, and a threatening cloud too, for as it sunk lower it&#10;increased in size, and concealed within was a &#34;fohn,&#34; fearful in&#10;its violence should it break loose. This journey, with its varied&#10;incidents,&#8212;the wild paths, the night passed on the mountain, the&#10;steep rocky precipices, the hollow clefts, in which the rustling&#10;waters from time immemorial had worn away passages for themselves&#10;through blocks of stone,&#8212;all these were firmly impressed on Rudy&#39;s&#10;memory.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In a forsaken stone building, which stood just beyond the&#10;seas of snow, they one night took shelter. Here they found some&#10;charcoal and pine branches, so that they soon made a fire. They&#10;arranged couches to lie on as well as they could, and then the men&#10;seated themselves by the fire, took out their pipes, and began to&#10;smoke. They also prepared a warm, spiced drink, of which they&#10;partook and Rudy was not forgotten&#8212;he had his share. Then they&#10;began to talk of those mysterious beings with which the land of the&#10;Alps abounds; the hosts of apparitions which come in the night, and&#10;carry off the sleepers through the air, to the wonderful floating&#10;town of Venice; of the wild herds-man, who drives the black sheep&#10;across the meadows. These flocks are never seen, yet the tinkle of&#10;their little bells has often been heard, as well as their unearthly&#10;bleating. Rudy listened eagerly, but without fear, for he knew not&#10;what fear meant; and while he listened, he fancied he could hear&#10;the roaring of the spectral herd. It seemed to come nearer and roar&#10;louder, till the men heard it also and listened in silence, till,&#10;at length, they told Rudy that he must not dare to sleep. It was a&#10;&#34;fohn,&#34; that violent storm-wind which rushes from the mountain to&#10;the valley beneath, and in its fury snaps asunder the trunks of&#10;large trees as if they were but slender reeds, and carries the&#10;wooden houses from one side of a river to the other as easily as we&#10;could move the pieces on a chess-board. After an hour had passed,&#10;they told Rudy that it was all over, and he might go to sleep; and,&#10;fatigued with his long walk, he readily slept at the word of&#10;command.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Very early the following morning they again set out. The&#10;sun on this day lighted up for Rudy new mountains, new glaciers,&#10;and new snow-fields. They had entered the Canton Valais, and found&#10;themselves on the ridge of the hills which can be seen from&#10;Grindelwald; but he was still far from his new home. They pointed&#10;out to him other clefts, other meadows, other woods and rocky&#10;paths, and other houses. Strange men made their appearance before&#10;him, and what men! They were misshapen, wretched-looking creatures,&#10;with yellow complexions; and on their necks were dark, ugly lumps&#10;of flesh, hanging down like bags. They were called cretins. They&#10;dragged themselves along painfully, and stared at the strangers&#10;with vacant eyes. The women looked more dreadful than the men. Poor&#10;Rudy! were these the sort of people he should see at his new&#10;home?&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('The Uncle'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Rudy arrived at last at his uncle&#39;s house, and was&#10;thankful to find the people like those he had been accustomed to&#10;see. There was only one cretin amongst them, a poor idiot boy, one&#10;of those unfortunate beings who, in their neglected conditions, go&#10;from house to house, and are received and taken care of in&#10;different families, for a month or two at a time.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Poor Saperli had just arrived at his uncle&#39;s house when&#10;Rudy came. The uncle was an experienced hunter; he also followed&#10;the trade of a cooper; his wife was a lively little person, with a&#10;face like a bird, eyes like those of an eagle, and a long, hairy&#10;throat. Everything was new to Rudy&#8212;the fashion of the dress, the&#10;manners, the employments, and even the language; but the latter his&#10;childish ear would soon learn. He saw also that there was more&#10;wealth here, when compared with his former home at his&#10;grandfather&#39;s. The rooms were larger, the walls were adorned with&#10;the horns of the chamois, and brightly polished guns. Over the door&#10;hung a painting of the Virgin Mary, fresh alpine roses and a&#10;burning lamp stood near it. Rudy&#39;s uncle was, as we have said, one&#10;of the most noted chamois hunters in the whole district, and also&#10;one of the best guides. Rudy soon became the pet of the house; but&#10;there was another pet, an old hound, blind and lazy, who would&#10;never more follow the hunt, well as he had once done so. But his&#10;former good qualities were not forgotten, and therefore the animal&#10;was kept in the family and treated with every indulgence. Rudy&#10;stroked the old hound, but he did not like strangers, and Rudy was&#10;as yet a stranger; he did not, however, long remain so, he soon&#10;endeared himself to every heart, and became like one of the&#10;family.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;We are not very badly off, here in the canton Valais,&#34;&#10;said his uncle one day; &#34;we have the chamois, they do not die so&#10;fast as the wild goats, and it is certainly much better here now&#10;than in former times. How highly the old times have been spoken of,&#10;but ours is better. The bag has been opened, and a current of air&#10;now blows through our once confined valley. Something better always&#10;makes its appearance when old, worn-out things fail.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;When his uncle became communicative, he would relate&#10;stories of his youthful days, and farther back still of the warlike&#10;times in which his father had lived. Valais was then, as he&#10;expressed it, only a closed-up bag, quite full of sick people,&#10;miserable cretins; but the French soldiers came, and they were&#10;capital doctors, they soon killed the disease and the sick people,&#10;too. The French people knew how to fight in more ways than one, and&#10;the girls knew how to conquer too; and when he said this the uncle&#10;nodded at his wife, who was a French woman by birth, and laughed.&#10;The French could also do battle on the stones. &#34;It was they who cut&#10;a road out of the solid rock over the Simplon&#8212;such a road, that I&#10;need only say to a child of three years old, &#39;Go down to Italy, you&#10;have only to keep in the high road,&#39; and the child will soon arrive&#10;in Italy, if he followed my directions.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the uncle sang a French song, and cried, &#34;Hurrah!&#10;long live Napoleon Buonaparte.&#34; This was the first time Rudy had&#10;ever heard of France, or of Lyons, that great city on the Rhone&#10;where his uncle had once lived. His uncle said that Rudy, in a very&#10;few years, would become a clever hunter, he had quite a talent for&#10;it; he taught the boy to hold a gun properly, and to load and fire&#10;it. In the hunting season he took him to the hills, and made him&#10;drink the warm blood of the chamois, which is said to prevent the&#10;hunter from becoming giddy; he taught him to know the time when,&#10;from the different mountains, the avalanche is likely to fall,&#10;namely, at noontide or in the evening, from the effects of the&#10;sun&#39;s rays; he made him observe the movements of the chamois when&#10;he gave a leap, so that he might fall firmly and lightly on his&#10;feet. He told him that when on the fissures of the rocks he could&#10;find no place for his feet, he must support himself on his elbows,&#10;and cling with his legs, and even lean firmly with his back, for&#10;this could be done when necessary. He told him also that the&#10;chamois are very cunning, they place lookers-out on the watch; but&#10;the hunter must be more cunning than they are, and find them out by&#10;the scent.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;One day, when Rudy went out hunting with his uncle, he&#10;hung a coat and hat on an alpine staff, and the chamois mistook it&#10;for a man, as they generally do. The mountain path was narrow here;&#10;indeed it was scarcely a path at all, only a kind of shelf, close&#10;to the yawning abyss. The snow that lay upon it was partially&#10;thawed, and the stones crumbled beneath the feet. Every fragment of&#10;stone broken off struck the sides of the rock in its fall, till it&#10;rolled into the depths beneath, and sunk to rest. Upon this shelf&#10;Rudy&#39;s uncle laid himself down, and crept forward. At about a&#10;hundred paces behind him stood Rudy, upon the highest point of the&#10;rock, watching a great vulture hovering in the air; with a single&#10;stroke of his wing the bird might easily cast the creeping hunter&#10;into the abyss beneath, and make him his prey. Rudy&#39;s uncle had&#10;eyes for nothing but the chamois, who, with its young kid, had just&#10;appeared round the edge of the rock. So Rudy kept his eyes fixed on&#10;the bird, he knew well what the great creature wanted; therefore he&#10;stood in readiness to discharge his gun at the proper moment.&#10;Suddenly the chamois made a spring, and his uncle fired and struck&#10;the animal with the deadly bullet; while the young kid rushed away,&#10;as if for a long life he had been accustomed to danger and&#10;practised flight. The large bird, alarmed at the report of the gun,&#10;wheeled off in another direction, and Rudy&#39;s uncle was saved from&#10;danger, of which he knew nothing till he was told of it by the&#10;boy.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;While they were both in pleasant mood, wending their way&#10;homewards, and the uncle whistling the tune of a song he had learnt&#10;in his young days, they suddenly heard a peculiar sound which&#10;seemed to come from the top of the mountain. They looked up, and&#10;saw above them, on the over-hanging rock, the snow-covering heave&#10;and lift itself as a piece of linen stretched on the ground to dry&#10;raises itself when the wind creeps under it. Smooth as polished&#10;marble slabs, the waves of snow cracked and loosened themselves,&#10;and then suddenly, with the rumbling noise of distant thunder, fell&#10;like a foaming cataract into the abyss. An avalanche had fallen,&#10;not upon Rudy and his uncle, but very near them. Alas, a great deal&#10;too near!&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Hold fast, Rudy!&#34; cried his uncle; &#34;hold fast, with all&#10;your might.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then Rudy clung with his arms to the trunk of the nearest&#10;tree, while his uncle climbed above him, and held fast by the&#10;branches. The avalanche rolled past them at some distance; but the&#10;gust of wind that followed, like the storm-wings of the avalanche,&#10;snapped asunder the trees and bushes over which it swept, as if&#10;they had been but dry rushes, and threw them about in every&#10;direction. The tree to which Rudy clung was thus overthrown, and&#10;Rudy dashed to the ground. The higher branches were snapped off,&#10;and carried away to a great distance; and among these shattered&#10;branches lay Rudy&#39;s uncle, with his skull fractured. When they&#10;found him, his hand was still warm; but it would have been&#10;impossible to recognize his face. Rudy stood by, pale and&#10;trembling; it was the first shock of his life, the first time he&#10;had ever felt fear. Late in the evening he returned home with the&#10;fatal news,&#8212;to that home which was now to be so full of sorrow. His&#10;uncle&#39;s wife uttered not a word, nor shed a tear, till the corpse&#10;was brought in; then her agony burst forth. The poor cretin crept&#10;away to his bed, and nothing was seen of him during the whole of&#10;the following day. Towards evening, however, he came to Rudy, and&#10;said, &#34;Will you write a letter for me? Saperli cannot write;&#10;Saperli can only take the letters to the post.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;A letter for you!&#34; said Rudy; &#34;who do you wish to write&#10;to?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;To the Lord Christ,&#34; he replied.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What do you mean?&#34; asked Rudy.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the poor idiot, as the cretin was often called,&#10;looked at Rudy with a most touching expression in his eyes, clasped&#10;his hands, and said, solemnly and devoutly, &#34;Saperli wants to send&#10;a letter to Jesus Christ, to pray Him to let Saperli die, and not&#10;the master of the house here.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Rudy pressed his hand, and replied, &#34;A letter would not&#10;reach Him up above; it would not give him back whom we have&#10;lost.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was not, however, easy for Rudy to convince Saperli of&#10;the impossibility of doing what he wished.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Now you must work for us,&#34; said his foster-mother; and&#10;Rudy very soon became the entire support of the house.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('Babette'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Who was the best marksman in the canton Valais? The&#10;chamois knew well. &#34;Save yourselves from Rudy,&#34; they might well&#10;say. And who is the handsomest marksman? &#34;Oh, it is Rudy,&#34; said the&#10;maidens; but they did not say, &#34;Save yourselves from Rudy.&#34; Neither&#10;did anxious mothers say so; for he bowed to them as pleasantly as&#10;to the young girls. He was so brave and cheerful. His cheeks were&#10;brown, his teeth white, and his eyes dark and sparkling. He was now&#10;a handsome young man of twenty years. The most icy water could not&#10;deter him from swimming; he could twist and turn like a fish. None&#10;could climb like he, and he clung as firmly to the edges of the&#10;rocks as a limpet. He had strong muscular power, as could be seen&#10;when he leapt from rock to rock. He had learnt this first from the&#10;cat, and more lately from the chamois. Rudy was considered the best&#10;guide over the mountains; every one had great confidence in him. He&#10;might have made a great deal of money as guide. His uncle had also&#10;taught him the trade of a cooper; but he had no inclination for&#10;either; his delight was in chamois-hunting, which also brought him&#10;plenty of money. Rudy would be a very good match, as people said,&#10;if he would not look above his own station. He was also such a&#10;famous partner in dancing, that the girls often dreamt about him,&#10;and one and another thought of him even when awake.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;He kissed me in the dance,&#34; said Annette, the&#10;schoolmaster&#39;s daughter, to her dearest friend; but she ought not&#10;to have told this, even to her dearest friend. It is not easy to&#10;keep such secrets; they are like sand in a sieve; they slip out. It&#10;was therefore soon known that Rudy, so brave and so good as he was,&#10;had kissed some one while dancing, and yet he had never kissed her&#10;who was dearest to him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ah, ah,&#34; said an old hunter, &#34;he has kissed Annette, has&#10;he? he has begun with A, and I suppose he will kiss through the&#10;whole alphabet.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But a kiss in the dance was all the busy tongues could&#10;accuse him of. He certainly had kissed Annette, but she was not the&#10;flower of his heart.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Down in the valley, near Bex, among the great&#10;walnut-trees, by the side of a little rushing mountain-stream,&#10;lived a rich miller. His dwelling-house was a large building, three&#10;storeys high, with little turrets. The roof was covered with chips,&#10;bound together with tin plates, that glittered in sunshine and in&#10;the moonlight. The largest of the turrets had a weather-cock,&#10;representing an apple pierced by a glittering arrow, in memory of&#10;William Tell. The mill was a neat and well-ordered place, that&#10;allowed itself to be sketched and written about; but the miller&#39;s&#10;daughter did not permit any to sketch or write about her. So, at&#10;least, Rudy would have said, for her image was pictured in his&#10;heart; her eyes shone in it so brightly, that quite a flame had&#10;been kindled there; and, like all other fires, it had burst forth&#10;so suddenly, that the miller&#39;s daughter, the beautiful Babette, was&#10;quite unaware of it. Rudy had never spoken a word to her on the&#10;subject. The miller was rich, and, on that account, Babette stood&#10;very high, and was rather difficult to aspire to. But said Rudy to&#10;himself, &#34;Nothing is too high for a man to reach: he must climb&#10;with confidence in himself, and he will not fail.&#34; He had learnt&#10;this lesson in his youthful home.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It happened once that Rudy had some business to settle at&#10;Bex. It was a long journey at that time, for the railway had not&#10;been opened. From the glaciers of the Rhone, at the foot of the&#10;Simplon, between its ever-changing mountain summits, stretches the&#10;valley of the canton Valais. Through it runs the noble river of the&#10;Rhone, which often overflows its banks, covering fields and&#10;highways, and destroying everything in its course. Near the towns&#10;of Sion and St. Maurice, the valley takes a turn, and bends like an&#10;elbow, and behind St. Maurice becomes so narrow that there is only&#10;space enough for the bed of the river and a narrow carriage-road.&#10;An old tower stands here, as if it were guardian to the canton&#10;Valais, which ends at this point; and from it we can look across&#10;the stone bridge to the toll-house on the other side, where the&#10;canton Vaud commences. Not far from this spot stands the town of&#10;Bex, and at every step can be seen an increase of fruitfulness and&#10;verdure. It is like entering a grove of chestnut and walnut-trees.&#10;Here and there the cypress and pomegranate blossoms peep forth; and&#10;it is almost as warm as an Italian climate. Rudy arrived at Bex,&#10;and soon finished the business which had brought him there, and&#10;then walked about the town; but not even the miller&#39;s boy could be&#10;seen, nor any one belonging to the mill, not to mention Babette.&#10;This did not please him at all. Evening came on. The air was filled&#10;with the perfume of the wild thyme and the blossoms of the&#10;lime-trees, and the green woods on the mountains seemed to be&#10;covered with a shining veil, blue as the sky. Over everything&#10;reigned a stillness, not of sleep or of death, but as if Nature&#10;were holding her breath, that her image might be photographed on&#10;the blue vault of heaven. Here and there, amidst the trees of the&#10;silent valley, stood poles which supported the wires of the&#10;electric telegraph. Against one of these poles leaned an object so&#10;motionless that it might have been mistaken for the trunk of a&#10;tree; but it was Rudy, standing there as still as at that moment&#10;was everything around him. He was not asleep, neither was he dead;&#10;but just as the various events in the world&#8212;matters of momentous&#10;importance to individuals&#8212;were flying through the telegraph wires,&#10;without the quiver of a wire or the slightest tone, so, through the&#10;mind of Rudy, thoughts of overwhelming importance were passing,&#10;without an outward sign of emotion. The happiness of his future&#10;life depended upon the decision of his present reflections. His&#10;eyes were fixed on one spot in the distance&#8212;a light that twinkled&#10;through the foliage from the parlor of the miller&#39;s house, where&#10;Babette dwelt. Rudy stood so still, that it might have been&#10;supposed he was watching for a chamois; but he was in reality like&#10;a chamois, who will stand for a moment, looking as if it were&#10;chiselled out of the rock, and then, if only a stone rolled by,&#10;would suddenly bound forward with a spring, far away from the&#10;hunter. And so with Rudy: a sudden roll of his thoughts roused him&#10;from his stillness, and made him bound forward with determination&#10;to act.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Never despair!&#34; cried he. &#34;A visit to the mill, to say&#10;good evening to the miller, and good evening to little Babette, can&#10;do no harm. No one ever fails who has confidence in himself. If I&#10;am to be Babette&#39;s husband, I must see her some time or&#10;other.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then Rudy laughed joyously, and took courage to go to the&#10;mill. He knew what he wanted; he wanted to marry Babette. The clear&#10;water of the river rolled over its yellow bed, and willows and&#10;lime-trees were reflected in it, as Rudy stepped along the path to&#10;the miller&#39;s house. But, as the children sing&#8212;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;There was no one at home in the house,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Only a kitten at play.&#34;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The cat standing on the steps put up its back and cried&#10;&#34;mew.&#34; But Rudy had no inclination for this sort of conversation;&#10;he passed on, and knocked at the door. No one heard him, no one&#10;opened the door. &#34;Mew,&#34; said the cat again; and had Rudy been still&#10;a child, he would have understood this language, and known that the&#10;cat wished to tell him there was no one at home. So he was obliged&#10;to go to the mill and make inquiries, and there he heard that the&#10;miller had gone on a journey to Interlachen, and taken Babette with&#10;him, to the great shooting festival, which began that morning, and&#10;would continue for eight days, and that people from all the German&#10;settlements would be there.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Poor Rudy! we may well say. It was not a fortunate day for&#10;his visit to Bex. He had just to return the way he came, through&#10;St. Maurice and Sion, to his home in the valley. But he did not&#10;despair. When the sun rose the next morning, his good spirits had&#10;returned; indeed he had never really lost them. &#34;Babette is at&#10;Interlachen,&#34; said Rudy to himself, &#34;many days&#39; journey from here.&#10;It is certainly a long way for any one who takes the high-road, but&#10;not so far if he takes a short cut across the mountain, and that&#10;just suits a chamois-hunter. I have been that way before, for it&#10;leads to the home of my childhood, where, as a little boy, I lived&#10;with my grandfather. And there are shooting matches at Interlachen.&#10;I will go, and try to stand first in the match. Babette will be&#10;there, and I shall be able to make her acquaintance.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Carrying his light knapsack, which contained his Sunday&#10;clothes, on his back, and with his musket and his game-bag over his&#10;shoulder, Rudy started to take the shortest way across the&#10;mountain. Still it was a great distance. The shooting matches were&#10;to commence on that day, and to continue for a whole week. He had&#10;been told also that the miller and Babette would remain that time&#10;with some relatives at Interlachen. So over the Gemmi Rudy climbed&#10;bravely, and determined to descend the side of the Grindelwald.&#10;Bright and joyous were his feelings as he stepped lightly onwards,&#10;inhaling the invigorating mountain air. The valley sunk as he&#10;ascended, the circle of the horizon expanded. One snow-capped peak&#10;after another rose before him, till the whole of the glittering&#10;Alpine range became visible. Rudy knew each ice-clad peak, and he&#10;continued his course towards the Schreckhorn, with its white&#10;powdered stone finger raised high in the air. At length he had&#10;crossed the highest ridges, and before him lay the green pasture&#10;lands sloping down towards the valley, which was once his home. The&#10;buoyancy of the air made his heart light. Hill and valley were&#10;blooming in luxuriant beauty, and his thoughts were youthful&#10;dreams, in which old age or death were out of the question. Life,&#10;power, and enjoyment were in the future, and he felt free and light&#10;as a bird. And the swallows flew round him, as in the days of his&#10;childhood, singing &#34;We and you&#8212;you and we.&#34; All was overflowing&#10;with joy. Beneath him lay the meadows, covered with velvety green,&#10;with the murmuring river flowing through them, and dotted here and&#10;there were small wooden houses. He could see the edges of the&#10;glaciers, looking like green glass against the soiled snow, and the&#10;deep chasms beneath the loftiest glacier. The church bells were&#10;ringing, as if to welcome him to his home with their sweet tones.&#10;His heart beat quickly, and for a moment he seemed to have&#10;foregotten Babette, so full were his thoughts of old recollections.&#10;He was, in imagination, once more wandering on the road where, when&#10;a little boy, he, with other children, came to sell their curiously&#10;carved toy houses. Yonder, behind the fir-trees, still stood his&#10;grandfather&#39;s house, his mother&#39;s father, but strangers dwelt in it&#10;now. Children came running to him, as he had once done, and wished&#10;to sell their wares. One of them offered him an Alpine rose. Rudy&#10;took the rose as a good omen, and thought of Babette. He quickly&#10;crossed the bridge where the two rivers flow into each other. Here&#10;he found a walk over-shadowed with large walnut-trees, and their&#10;thick foliage formed a pleasant shade. Very soon he perceived in&#10;the distance, waving flags, on which glittered a white cross on a&#10;red ground&#8212;the standard of the Danes as well as of the Swiss&#8212;and&#10;before him lay Interlachen.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It is really a splendid town, like none other that I have&#10;ever seen,&#34; said Rudy to himself. It was indeed a Swiss town in its&#10;holiday dress. Not like the many other towns, crowded with heavy&#10;stone houses, stiff and foreign looking. No; here it seemed as if&#10;the wooden houses on the hills had run into the valley, and placed&#10;themselves in rows and ranks by the side of the clear river, which&#10;rushes like an arrow in its course. The streets were rather&#10;irregular, it is true, but still this added to their picturesque&#10;appearance. There was one street which Rudy thought the prettiest&#10;of them all; it had been built since he had visited the town when a&#10;little boy. It seemed to him as if all the neatest and most&#10;curiously carved toy houses which his grandfather once kept in the&#10;large cupboard at home, had been brought out and placed in this&#10;spot, and that they had increased in size since then, as the old&#10;chestnut trees had done. The houses were called hotels; the&#10;woodwork on the windows and balconies was curiously carved. The&#10;roofs were gayly painted, and before each house was a flower&#10;garden, which separated it from the macadamized high-road. These&#10;houses all stood on the same side of the road, so that the fresh,&#10;green meadows, in which were cows grazing, with bells on their&#10;necks, were not hidden. The sound of these bells is often heard&#10;amidst Alpine scenery. These meadows were encircled by lofty hills,&#10;which receded a little in the centre, so that the most beautifully&#10;formed of Swiss mountains&#8212;the snow-crowned Jungfrau&#8212;could be&#10;distinctly seen glittering in the distance. A number of elegantly&#10;dressed gentlemen and ladies from foreign lands, and crowds of&#10;country people from the neighboring cantons, were assembled in the&#10;town. Each marksman wore the number of hits he had made twisted in&#10;a garland round his hat. Here were music and singing of all&#10;descriptions: hand-organs, trumpets, shouting, and noise. The&#10;houses and bridges were adorned with verses and inscriptions. Flags&#10;and banners were waving. Shot after shot was fired, which was the&#10;best music to Rudy&#39;s ears. And amidst all this excitement he quite&#10;forgot Babette, on whose account only he had come. The shooters&#10;were thronging round the target, and Rudy was soon amongst them.&#10;But when he took his turn to fire, he proved himself the best shot,&#10;for he always struck the bull&#39;s-eye.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Who may that young stranger be?&#34; was the inquiry on all&#10;sides. &#34;He speaks French as it is spoken in the Swiss&#10;cantons.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And makes himself understood very well when he speaks&#10;German,&#34; said some.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;He lived here, when a child, with his grandfather, in a&#10;house on the road to Grindelwald,&#34; remarked one of the&#10;sportsmen.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And full of life was this young stranger; his eyes&#10;sparkled, his glance was steady, and his arm sure, therefore he&#10;always hit the mark. Good fortune gives courage, and Rudy was&#10;always courageous. He soon had a circle of friends gathered round&#10;him. Every one noticed him, and did him homage. Babette had quite&#10;vanished from his thoughts, when he was struck on the shoulder by a&#10;heavy hand, and a deep voice said to him in French, &#34;You are from&#10;the canton Valais.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Rudy turned round, and beheld a man with a ruddy, pleasant&#10;face, and a stout figure. It was the rich miller from Bex. His&#10;broad, portly person, hid the slender, lovely Babette; but she came&#10;forward and glanced at him with her bright, dark eyes. The rich&#10;miller was very much flattered at the thought that the young man,&#10;who was acknowledged to be the best shot, and was so praised by&#10;every one, should be from his own canton. Now was Rudy really&#10;fortunate: he had travelled all this way to this place, and those&#10;he had forgotten were now come to seek him. When country people go&#10;far from home, they often meet with those they know, and improve&#10;their acquaintance. Rudy, by his shooting, had gained the first&#10;place in the shooting-match, just as the miller at home at Bex&#10;stood first, because of his money and his mill. So the two men&#10;shook hands, which they had never done before. Babette, too, held&#10;out her hand to Rudy frankly, and he pressed it in his, and looked&#10;at her so earnestly, that she blushed deeply. The miller talked of&#10;the long journey they had travelled, and of the many towns they had&#10;seen. It was his opinion that he had really made as great a journey&#10;as if he had travelled in a steamship, a railway carriage, or a&#10;post-chaise.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I came by a much shorter way,&#34; said Rudy; &#34;I came over&#10;the mountains. There is no road so high that a man may not venture&#10;upon it.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ah, yes; and break your neck,&#34; said the miller; &#34;and you&#10;look like one who will break his neck some day, you are so&#10;daring.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, nothing ever happens to a man if he has confidence in&#10;himself,&#34; replied Rudy.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The miller&#39;s relations at Interlachen, with whom the&#10;miller and Babette were staying, invited Rudy to visit them, when&#10;they found he came from the same canton as the miller. It was a&#10;most pleasant visit. Good fortune seemed to follow him, as it does&#10;those who think and act for themselves, and who remember the&#10;proverb, &#34;Nuts are given to us, but they are not cracked for us.&#34;&#10;And Rudy was treated by the miller&#39;s relations almost like one of&#10;the family, and glasses of wine were poured out to drink to the&#10;welfare of the best shooter. Babette clinked glasses with Rudy, and&#10;he returned thanks for the toast. In the evening they all took a&#10;delightful walk under the walnut-trees, in front of the stately&#10;hotels; there were so many people, and such crowding, that Rudy was&#10;obliged to offer his arm to Babette. Then he told her how happy it&#10;made him to meet people from the canton Vaud,&#8212;for Vaud and Valais&#10;were neighboring cantons. He spoke of this pleasure so heartily&#10;that Babette could not resist giving his arm a slight squeeze; and&#10;so they walked on together, and talked and chatted like old&#10;acquaintances. Rudy felt inclined to laugh sometimes at the absurd&#10;dress and walk of the foreign ladies; but Babette did not wish to&#10;make fun of them, for she knew there must be some good, excellent&#10;people amongst them; she, herself, had a godmother, who was a&#10;high-born English lady. Eighteen years before, when Babette was&#10;christened, this lady was staying at Bex, and she stood godmother&#10;for her, and gave her the valuable brooch she now wore in her&#10;bosom.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Her godmother had twice written to her, and this year she&#10;was expected to visit Interlachen with her two daughters; &#34;but they&#10;are old-maids,&#34; added Babette, who was only eighteen: &#34;they are&#10;nearly thirty.&#34; Her sweet little mouth was never still a moment,&#10;and all that she said sounded in Rudy&#39;s ears as matters of the&#10;greatest importance, and at last he told her what he was longing to&#10;tell. How often he had been at Bex, how well he knew the mill, and&#10;how often he had seen Babette, when most likely she had not noticed&#10;him; and lastly, that full of many thoughts which he could not tell&#10;her, he had been to the mill on the evening when she and her father&#10;has started on their long journey, but not too far for him to find&#10;a way to overtake them. He told her all this, and a great deal&#10;more; he told her how much he could endure for her; and that it was&#10;to see her, and not the shooting-match, which had brought him to&#10;Interlachen. Babette became quite silent after hearing all this; it&#10;was almost too much, and it troubled her.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And while they thus wandered on, the sun sunk behind the&#10;lofty mountains. The Jungfrau stood out in brightness and splendor,&#10;as a back-ground to the green woods of the surrounding hills. Every&#10;one stood still to look at the beautiful sight, Rudy and Babette&#10;among them.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Nothing can be more beautiful than this,&#34; said&#10;Babette.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Nothing!&#34; replied Rudy, looking at Babette.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;To-morrow I must return home,&#34; remarked Rudy a few&#10;minutes afterwards.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Come and visit us at Bex,&#34; whispered Babette; &#34;my father&#10;will be pleased to see you.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')

He had three silver&#10;cups, two handsome pistols, and a silver coffee-pot. This latter&#10;would be useful when he began housekeeping. But all these were not&#10;the heaviest weight he had to bear; something mightier and more&#10;important he carried with him in his heart, over the high&#10;mountains, as he journeyed homeward.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The weather was dismally dark, and inclined to rain; the&#10;clouds hung low, like a mourning veil on the tops of the mountains,&#10;and shrouded their glittering peaks. In the woods could be heard&#10;the sound of the axe and the heavy fall of the trunks of the trees,&#10;as they rolled down the slopes of the mountains. When seen from the&#10;heights, the trunks of these trees looked like slender stems; but&#10;on a nearer inspection they were found to be large and strong&#10;enough for the masts of a ship. The river murmured monotonously,&#10;the wind whistled, and the clouds sailed along&#10;hurriedly.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Suddenly there appeared, close by Rudy&#39;s side, a young&#10;maiden; he had not noticed her till she came quite near to him. She&#10;was also going to ascend the mountain. The maiden&#39;s eyes shone with&#10;an unearthly power, which obliged you to look into them; they were&#10;strange eyes,&#8212;clear, deep, and unfathomable.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Hast thou a lover?&#34; asked Rudy; all his thoughts were&#10;naturally on love just then.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I have none,&#34; answered the maiden, with a laugh; it was&#10;as if she had not spoken the truth.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Do not let us go such a long way round,&#34; said she. &#34;We&#10;must keep to the left; it is much shorter.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ah, yes,&#34; he replied; &#34;and fall into some crevasse. Do&#10;you pretend to be a guide, and not know the road better than&#10;that?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I know every step of the way,&#34; said she; &#34;and my thoughts&#10;are collected, while yours are down in the valley yonder. We should&#10;think of the Ice Maiden while we are up here; men say she is not&#10;kind to their race.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I fear her not,&#34; said Rudy. &#34;She could not keep me when I&#10;was a child; I will not give myself up to her now I am a&#10;man.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Darkness came on, the rain fell, and then it began to&#10;snow, and the whiteness dazzled the eyes.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Give me your hand,&#34; said the maiden; &#34;I will help you to&#10;mount.&#34; And he felt the touch of her icy fingers.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You help me,&#34; cried Rudy; &#34;I do not yet require a woman&#10;to help me to climb.&#34; And he stepped quickly forwards away from&#10;her.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The drifting snow-shower fell like a veil between them,&#10;the wind whistled, and behind him he could hear the maiden laughing&#10;and singing, and the sound was most strange to hear.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It certainly must be a spectre or a servant of the Ice&#10;Maiden,&#34; thought Rudy, who had heard such things talked about when&#10;he was a little boy, and had stayed all night on the mountain with&#10;the guides.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The snow fell thicker than ever, the clouds lay beneath&#10;him; he looked back, there was no one to be seen, but he heard&#10;sounds of mocking laughter, which were not those of a human&#10;voice.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;When Rudy at length reached the highest part of the&#10;mountain, where the path led down to the valley of the Rhone, the&#10;snow had ceased, and in the clear heavens he saw two bright stars&#10;twinkling.

Text.create(:title => coder.decode('The Visit to the Mill'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What beautiful things you have brought home!&#34; said his&#10;old foster-mother; and her strange-looking eagle-eyes sparkled,&#10;while she wriggled and twisted her skinny neck more quickly and&#10;strangely than ever. &#34;You have brought good luck with you, Rudy. I&#10;must give you a kiss, my dear boy.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Rudy allowed himself to be kissed; but it could be seen by&#10;his countenance that he only endured the infliction as a homely&#10;duty.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;How handsome you are, Rudy!&#34; said the old&#10;woman.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Don&#39;t flatter,&#34; said Rudy, with a laugh; but still he was&#10;pleased.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I must say once more,&#34; said the old woman, &#34;that you are&#10;very lucky.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Well, in that I believe you are right,&#34; said he, as he&#10;thought of Babette. Never had he felt such a longing for that deep&#10;valley as he now had. &#34;They must have returned home by this time,&#34;&#10;said he to himself, &#34;it is already two days over the time which&#10;they fixed upon. I must go to Bex.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;So Rudy set out to go to Bex; and when he arrived there,&#10;he found the miller and his daughter at home. They received him&#10;kindly, and brought him many greetings from their friends at&#10;Interlachen. Babette did not say much. She seemed to have become&#10;quite silent; but her eyes spoke, and that was quite enough for&#10;Rudy. The miller had generally a great deal to talk about, and&#10;seemed to expect that every one should listen to his jokes, and&#10;laugh at them; for was not he the rich miller? But now he was more&#10;inclined to hear Rudy&#39;s adventures while hunting and travelling,&#10;and to listen to his descriptions of the difficulties the&#10;chamois-hunter has to overcome on the mountain-tops, or of the&#10;dangerous snow-drifts which the wind and weather cause to cling to&#10;the edges of the rocks, or to lie in the form of a frail bridge&#10;over the abyss beneath. The eyes of the brave Rudy sparkled as he&#10;described the life of a hunter, or spoke of the cunning of the&#10;chamois and their wonderful leaps; also of the powerful fohn and&#10;the rolling avalanche. He noticed that the more he described, the&#10;more interested the miller became, especially when he spoke of the&#10;fierce vulture and of the royal eagle. Not far from Bex, in the&#10;canton Valais, was an eagle&#39;s nest, more curiously built under a&#10;high, over-hanging rock. In this nest was a young eagle; but who&#10;would venture to take it? A young Englishman had offered Rudy a&#10;whole handful of gold, if he would bring him the young eagle&#10;alive.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;There is a limit to everything,&#34; was Rudy&#39;s reply. &#34;The&#10;eagle could not be taken; it would be folly to attempt&#10;it.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The wine was passed round freely, and the conversation&#10;kept up pleasantly; but the evening seemed too short for Rudy,&#10;although it was midnight when he left the miller&#39;s house, after&#10;this his first visit.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;While the lights in the windows of the miller&#39;s house&#10;still twinkled through the green foliage, out through the open&#10;skylight came the parlor-cat on to the roof, and along the&#10;water-pipe walked the kitchen-cat to meet her.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What is the news at the mill?&#34; asked the parlor-cat.&#10;&#34;Here in the house there is secret love-making going on, which the&#10;father knows nothing about. Rudy and Babette have been treading on&#10;each other&#39;s paws, under the table, all the evening. They trod on&#10;my tail twice, but I did not mew; that would have attracted&#10;notice.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Well, I should have mewed,&#34; said the&#10;kitchen-cat.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What might suit the kitchen would not suit the parlor,&#34;&#10;said the other. &#34;I am quite curious to know what the miller will&#10;say when he finds out this engagement.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Yes, indeed; what would the miller say? Rudy himself was&#10;anxious to know that; but to wait till the miller heard of it from&#10;others was out of the question. Therefore, not many days after this&#10;visit, he was riding in the omnibus that runs between the two&#10;cantons, Valais and Vaud. These cantons are separated by the Rhone,&#10;over which is a bridge that unites them. Rudy, as usual, had plenty&#10;of courage, and indulged in pleasant thoughts of the favorable&#10;answer he should receive that evening. And when the omnibus&#10;returned, Rudy was again seated in it, going homewards; and at the&#10;same time the parlor-cat at the miller&#39;s house ran out quickly,&#10;crying,&#8212;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Here, you from the kitchen, what do you think? The miller&#10;knows all now. Everything has come to a delightful end. Rudy came&#10;here this evening, and he and Babette had much whispering and&#10;secret conversation together. They stood in the path near the&#10;miller&#39;s room. I lay at their feet; but they had no eyes or&#10;thoughts for me.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;I will go to your father at once,&#39; said he; &#39;it is the&#10;most honorable way.&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;Shall I go with you?&#39; asked Babette; &#39;it will give you&#10;courage.&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;I have plenty of courage,&#39; said Rudy; &#39;but if you are&#10;with me, he must be friendly, whether he says Yes or&#10;No.&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;So they turned to go in, and Rudy trod heavily on my&#10;tail; he certainly is very clumsy. I mewed; but neither he nor&#10;Babette had any ears for me. They opened the door, and entered&#10;together. I was before them, and jumped on the back of a chair. I&#10;hardly know what Rudy said; but the miller flew into a rage, and&#10;threatened to kick him out of the house. He told him he might go to&#10;the mountains, and look after the chamois, but not after our little&#10;Babette.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And what did they say? Did they speak?&#34; asked the&#10;kitchen-cat.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What did they say! why, all that people generally do say&#10;when they go a-wooing&#8212;&#39;I love her, and she loves me; and when there&#10;is milk in the can for one, there is milk in the can for&#10;two.&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;But she is so far above you,&#39; said the miller; &#39;she has&#10;heaps of gold, as you know. You should not attempt to reach&#10;her.&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;There is nothing so high that a man cannot reach, if he&#10;will,&#39; answered Rudy; for he is a brave youth.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;Yet you could not reach the young eagle,&#39; said the&#10;miller, laughing. &#39;Babette is higher than the eagle&#39;s&#10;nest.&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;I will have them both,&#39; said Rudy.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;Very well; I will give her to you when you bring me the&#10;young eaglet alive,&#39; said the miller; and he laughed till the tears&#10;stood in his eyes. &#39;But now I thank you for this visit, Rudy; and&#10;if you come to-morrow, you will find nobody at home. Good-bye,&#10;Rudy.&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Babette also wished him farewell; but her voice sounded&#10;as mournful as the mew of a little kitten that has lost its&#10;mother.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;A promise is a promise between man and man,&#39; said Rudy.&#10;&#39;Do not weep, Babette; I shall bring the young eagle.&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;You will break your neck, I hope,&#39; said the miller, &#39;and&#10;we shall be relieved from your company.&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I call that kicking him out of the house,&#34; said the&#10;parlor-cat. &#34;And now Rudy is gone, and Babette sits and weeps,&#10;while the miller sings German songs that he learnt on his journey;&#10;but I do not trouble myself on the matter,&#8212;it would be of no&#10;use.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yet, for all that, it is a very strange affair,&#34; said the&#10;kitchen-cat.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')

It&#10;was Rudy, going to meet his friend Vesinaud. &#34;You must come and&#10;help,&#34; said he. &#34;I want to carry off the young eaglet from the top&#10;of the rock. We will take young Ragli with us.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Had you not better first try to take down the moon? That&#10;would be quite as easy a task,&#34; said Vesinaud. &#34;You seem to be in&#10;good spirits.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, indeed I am. I am thinking of my wedding. But to be&#10;serious, I will tell you all about it, and how I am&#10;situated.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then he explained to Vesinaud and Ragli what he wished to&#10;do, and why.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You are a daring fellow,&#34; said they; &#34;but it is no use;&#10;you will break your neck.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No one falls, unless he is afraid,&#34; said Rudy.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;So at midnight they set out, carrying with them poles,&#10;ladders, and ropes. The road lay amidst brushwood and underwood,&#10;over rolling stones, always upwards higher and higher in the dark&#10;night. Waters roared beneath them, or fell in cascades from above.&#10;Humid clouds were driving through the air as the hunters reached&#10;the precipitous ledge of the rock. It was even darker here, for the&#10;sides of the rocks almost met, and the light penetrated only&#10;through a small opening at the top. At a little distance from the&#10;edge could be heard the sound of the roaring, foaming waters in the&#10;yawning abyss beneath them. The three seated themselves on a stone,&#10;to await in stillness the dawn of day, when the parent eagle would&#10;fly out, as it would be necessary to shoot the old bird before they&#10;could think of gaining possession of the young one. Rudy sat&#10;motionless, as if he had been part of the stone on which he sat. He&#10;held his gun ready to fire, with his eyes fixed steadily on the&#10;highest point of the cliff, where the eagle&#39;s nest lay concealed&#10;beneath the overhanging rock.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The three hunters had a long time to wait. At last they&#10;heard a rustling, whirring sound above them, and a large hovering&#10;object darkened the air. Two guns were ready to aim at the dark&#10;body of the eagle as it rose from the nest. Then a shot was fired;&#10;for an instant the bird fluttered its wide-spreading wings, and&#10;seemed as if it would fill up the whole of the chasm, and drag down&#10;the hunters in its fall. But it was not so; the eagle sunk&#10;gradually into the abyss beneath, and the branches of trees and&#10;bushes were broken by its weight. Then the hunters roused&#10;themselves: three of the longest ladders were brought and bound&#10;together; the topmost ring of these ladders would just reach the&#10;edge of the rock which hung over the abyss, but no farther. The&#10;point beneath which the eagle&#39;s nest lay sheltered was much higher,&#10;and the sides of the rock were as smooth as a wall. After&#10;consulting together, they determined to bind together two more&#10;ladders, and to hoist them over the cavity, and so form a&#10;communication with the three beneath them, by binding the upper&#10;ones to the lower. With great difficulty they contrived to drag the&#10;two ladders over the rock, and there they hung for some moments,&#10;swaying over the abyss; but no sooner had they fastened them&#10;together, than Rudy placed his foot on the lowest step.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was a bitterly cold morning; clouds of mist were rising&#10;from beneath, and Rudy stood on the lower step of the ladder as a&#10;fly rests on a piece of swinging straw, which a bird may have&#10;dropped from the edge of the nest it was building on some tall&#10;factory chimney; but the fly could fly away if the straw were&#10;shaken, Rudy could only break his neck. The wind whistled around&#10;him, and beneath him the waters of the abyss, swelled by the&#10;thawing of the glaciers, those palaces of the Ice Maiden, foamed&#10;and roared in their rapid course. When Rudy began to ascend, the&#10;ladder trembled like the web of the spider, when it draws out the&#10;long, delicate threads; but as soon as he reached the fourth of the&#10;ladders, which had been bound together, he felt more confidence,&#8212;he&#10;knew that they had been fastened securely by skilful hands. The&#10;fifth ladder, that appeared to reach the nest, was supported by the&#10;sides of the rock, yet it swung to and fro, and flapped about like&#10;a slender reed, and as if it had been bound by fishing lines. It&#10;seemed a most dangerous undertaking to ascend it, but Rudy knew how&#10;to climb; he had learnt that from the cat, and he had no fear. He&#10;did not observe Vertigo, who stood in the air behind him, trying to&#10;lay hold of him with his outstretched polypous arms.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;When at length he stood on the topmost step of the ladder,&#10;he found that he was still some distance below the nest, and not&#10;even able to see into it. Only by using his hands and climbing&#10;could he possibly reach it. He tried the strength of the stunted&#10;trees, and the thick underwood upon which the nest rested, and of&#10;which it was formed, and finding they would support his weight, he&#10;grasped them firmly, and swung himself up from the ladder till his&#10;head and breast were above the nest, and then what an overpowering&#10;stench came from it, for in it lay the putrid remains of lambs,&#10;chamois, and birds. Vertigo, although he could not reach him, blew&#10;the poisonous vapor in his face, to make him giddy and faint; and&#10;beneath, in the dark, yawning deep, on the rushing waters, sat the&#10;Ice Maiden, with her long, pale, green hair falling around her, and&#10;her death-like eyes fixed upon him, like the two barrels of a gun.&#10;&#34;I have thee now,&#34; she cried.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In a corner of the eagle&#39;s nest sat the young eaglet, a&#10;large and powerful bird, though still unable to fly. Rudy fixed his&#10;eyes upon it, held on by one hand with all his strength, and with&#10;the other threw a noose round the young eagle. The string slipped&#10;to its legs. Rudy tightened it, and thus secured the bird alive.&#10;Then flinging the sling over his shoulder, so that the creature&#10;hung a good way down behind him, he prepared to descend with the&#10;help of a rope, and his foot soon touched safely the highest step&#10;of the ladder. Then Rudy, remembering his early lesson in climbing,&#10;&#34;Hold fast, and do not fear,&#34; descended carefully down the ladders,&#10;and at last stood safely on the ground with the young living&#10;eaglet, where he was received with loud shouts of joy and&#10;congratulations.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')

Its&#10;short, strong beak was open, ready to bite, and on its red throat&#10;were short feathers, like stubble.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The young eaglet!&#34; cried the miller.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Babette screamed, and started back, while her eyes&#10;wandered from Rudy to the bird in astonishment.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You are not to be discouraged by difficulties, I see,&#34;&#10;said the miller.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And you will keep your word,&#34; replied Rudy. &#34;Each has his&#10;own characteristic, whether it is honor or courage.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But how is it you did not break your neck?&#34; asked the&#10;miller.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Because I held fast,&#34; answered Rudy; &#34;and I mean to hold&#10;fast to Babette.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You must get her first,&#34; said the miller, laughing; and&#10;Babette thought this a very good sign.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;We must take the bird out of the basket,&#34; said she. &#34;It&#10;is getting into a rage; how its eyes glare. How did you manage to&#10;conquer it?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then Rudy had to describe his adventure, and the miller&#39;s&#10;eyes opened wide as he listened.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;With your courage and your good fortune you might win&#10;three wives,&#34; said the miller.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, thank you,&#34; cried Rudy.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But you have not won Babette yet,&#34; said the miller,&#10;slapping the young Alpine hunter on the shoulder&#10;playfully.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Have you heard the fresh news at the mill?&#34; asked the&#10;parlor-cat of the kitchen-cat. &#34;Rudy has brought us the young&#10;eagle, and he is to take Babette in exchange. They kissed each&#10;other in the presence of the old man, which is as good as an&#10;engagement. He was quite civil about it; drew in his claws, and&#10;took his afternoon nap, so that the two were left to sit and wag&#10;their tails as much as they pleased. They have so much to talk&#10;about that it will not be finished till Christmas.&#34; Neither was it&#10;finished till Christmas.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The wind whirled the faded, fallen leaves; the snow&#10;drifted in the valleys, as well as upon the mountains, and the Ice&#10;Maiden sat in the stately palace which, in winter time, she&#10;generally occupied. The perpendicular rocks were covered with&#10;slippery ice, and where in summer the stream from the rocks had&#10;left a watery veil, icicles large and heavy hung from the trees,&#10;while the snow-powdered fir-trees were decorated with fantastic&#10;garlands of crystal. The Ice Maiden rode on the howling wind across&#10;the deep valleys, the country, as far as Bex, was covered with a&#10;carpet of snow, so that the Ice Maiden could follow Rudy, and see&#10;him, when he visited the mill; and while in the room at the&#10;miller&#39;s house, where he was accustomed to spend so much of his&#10;time with Babette. The wedding was to take place in the following&#10;summer, and they heard enough of it, for so many of their friends&#10;spoke of the matter.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then came sunshine to the mill. The beautiful Alpine roses&#10;bloomed, and joyous, laughing Babette, was like the early spring,&#10;which makes all the birds sing of summer time and bridal&#10;days.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;How those two do sit and chatter together,&#34; said the&#10;parlor-cat; &#34;I have had enough of their mewing.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')

She sometimes allows herself to&#10;be carried by the keen wind to the lofty snow-fields, where she&#10;stretches herself in the sunshine on the soft snowy-cushions. From&#10;thence she throws her far-seeing glance into the deep valley&#10;beneath, where human beings are busily moving about like ants on a&#10;stone in the sun. &#34;Spirits of strength, as the children of the sun&#10;call you,&#34; cried the Ice Maiden, &#34;ye are but worms! Let but a&#10;snow-ball roll, and you and your houses and your towns are crushed&#10;and swept away.&#34; And she raised her proud head, and looked around&#10;her with eyes that flashed death from their glance. From the valley&#10;came a rumbling sound; men were busily at work blasting the rocks&#10;to form tunnels, and laying down roads for the railway. &#34;They are&#10;playing at work underground, like moles,&#34; said she. &#34;They are&#10;digging passages beneath the earth, and the noise is like the&#10;reports of cannons. I shall throw down my palaces, for the clamor&#10;is louder than the roar of thunder.&#34; Then there ascended from the&#10;valley a thick vapor, which waved itself in the air like a&#10;fluttering veil. It rose, as a plume of feathers, from a steam&#10;engine, to which, on the lately-opened railway, a string of&#10;carriages was linked, carriage to carriage, looking like a winding&#10;serpent. The train shot past with the speed of an arrow. &#34;They play&#10;at being masters down there, those spirits of strength!&#34; exclaimed&#10;the Ice Maiden; &#34;but the powers of nature are still the rulers.&#34;&#10;And she laughed and sang till her voice sounded through the valley,&#10;and people said it was the rolling of an avalanche. But the&#10;children of the sun sang in louder strains in praise of the mind of&#10;man, which can span the sea as with a yoke, can level mountains,&#10;and fill up valleys. It is the power of thought which gives man the&#10;mastery over nature.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Just at this moment there came across the snow-field,&#10;where the Ice Maiden sat, a party of travellers. They had bound&#10;themselves fast to each other, so that they looked like one large&#10;body on the slippery plains of ice encircling the deep&#10;abyss.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Worms!&#34; exclaimed the Ice Maiden. &#34;You, the lords of the&#10;powers of nature!&#34; And she turned away and looked maliciously at&#10;the deep valley where the railway train was rushing by. &#34;There they&#10;sit, these thoughts!&#34; she exclaimed. &#34;There they sit in their power&#10;over nature&#39;s strength. I see them all. One sits proudly apart,&#10;like a king; others sit together in a group; yonder, half of them&#10;are asleep; and when the steam dragon stops, they will get out and&#10;go their way. The thoughts go forth into the world,&#34; and she&#10;laughed.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;There goes another avalanche,&#34; said those in the valley&#10;beneath.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It will not reach us,&#34; said two who sat together behind&#10;the steam dragon. &#34;Two hearts and one beat,&#34; as people say.

They had&#10;only lately arrived, yet the miller had paid them a visit, and&#10;informed them of Babette&#39;s engagement to Rudy. The whole story of&#10;their meeting at Interlachen, and his brave adventure with the&#10;eaglet, were related to them, and they were all very much&#10;interested, and as pleased about Rudy and Babette as the miller&#10;himself. The three were invited to come to Montreux; it was but&#10;right for Babette to become acquainted with her godmother, who&#10;wished to see her very much. A steam-boat started from the town of&#10;Villeneuve, at one end of the lake of Geneva, and arrived at&#10;Bernex, a little town beyond Montreux, in about half an hour. And&#10;in this boat, the miller, with his daughter and Rudy, set out to&#10;visit her godmother. They passed the coast which has been so&#10;celebrated in song. Here, under the walnut-trees, by the deep blue&#10;lake, sat Byron, and wrote his melodious verses about the prisoner&#10;confined in the gloomy castle of Chillon. Here, where Clarens, with&#10;its weeping-willows, is reflected in the clear water, wandered&#10;Rousseau, dreaming of Heloise. The river Rhone glides gently by&#10;beneath the lofty snow-capped hills of Savoy, and not far from its&#10;mouth lies a little island in the lake, so small that, seen from&#10;the shore, it looks like a ship. The surface of the island is&#10;rocky; and about a hundred years ago, a lady caused the ground to&#10;be covered with earth, in which three acacia-trees were planted,&#10;and the whole enclosed with stone walls. The acacia-trees now&#10;overshadow every part of the island. Babette was enchanted with the&#10;spot; it seemed to her the most beautiful object in the whole&#10;voyage, and she thought how much she should like to land there. But&#10;the steam-ship passed it by, and did not stop till it reached&#10;Bernex. The little party walked slowly from this place to Montreux,&#10;passing the sun-lit walls with which the vineyards of the little&#10;mountain town of Montreux are surrounded, and peasants&#39; houses,&#10;overshadowed by fig-trees, with gardens in which grow the laurel&#10;and the cypress.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Halfway up the hill stood the boarding-house in which&#10;Babette&#39;s godmother resided. She was received most cordially; her&#10;godmother was a very friendly woman, with a round, smiling&#10;countenance. When a child, her head must have resembled one of&#10;Raphael&#39;s cherubs; it was still an angelic face, with its white&#10;locks of silvery hair. The daughters were tall, elegant, slender&#10;maidens.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The young cousin, whom they had brought with them, was&#10;dressed in white from head to foot; he had golden hair and golden&#10;whiskers, large enough to be divided amongst three gentlemen; and&#10;he began immediately to pay the greatest attention to&#10;Babette.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Richly bound books, note-paper, and drawings, lay on the&#10;large table. The balcony window stood open, and from it could be&#10;seen the beautiful wide extended lake, the water so clear and&#10;still, that the mountains of Savoy, with their villages, woods, and&#10;snow-crowned peaks, were clearly reflected in it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Rudy, who was usually so lively and brave, did not in the&#10;least feel himself at home; he acted as if he were walking on peas,&#10;over a slippery floor. How long and wearisome the time appeared; it&#10;was like being in a treadmill. And then they went out for a walk,&#10;which was very slow and tedious. Two steps forward and one&#10;backwards had Rudy to take to keep pace with the others. They&#10;walked down to Chillon, and went over the old castle on the rocky&#10;island. They saw the implements of torture, the deadly dungeons,&#10;the rusty fetters in the rocky walls, the stone benches for those&#10;condemned to death, the trap-doors through which the unhappy&#10;creatures were hurled upon iron spikes, and impaled alive. They&#10;called looking at all these a pleasure. It certainly was the right&#10;place to visit. Byron&#39;s poetry had made it celebrated in the world.&#10;Rudy could only feel that it was a place of execution. He leaned&#10;against the stone framework of the window, and gazed down into the&#10;deep, blue water, and over to the little island with the three&#10;acacias, and wished himself there, away and free from the whole&#10;chattering party. But Babette was most unusually lively and&#10;good-tempered.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I have been so amused,&#34; she said.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The cousin had found her quite perfect.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;He is a perfect fop,&#34; said Rudy; and this was the first&#10;time Rudy had said anything that did not please Babette.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Englishman had made her a present of a little book, in&#10;remembrance of their visit to Chillon. It was Byron&#39;s poem, &#34;The&#10;Prisoner of Chillon,&#34; translated into French, so that Babette could&#10;read it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The book may be very good,&#34; said Rudy; &#34;but that finely&#10;combed fellow who gave it to you is not worth much.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;He looks something like a flour-sack without any flour,&#34;&#10;said the miller, laughing at his own wit. Rudy laughed, too, for so&#10;had he appeared to him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('The Cousin'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;When Rudy went a few days after to pay a visit to the&#10;mill, he found the young Englishman there. Babette was just&#10;thinking of preparing some trout to set before him. She understood&#10;well how to garnish the dish with parsley, and make it look quite&#10;tempting. Rudy thought all this quite unnecessary. What did the&#10;Englishman want there? What was he about? Why should he be&#10;entertained, and waited upon by Babette? Rudy was jealous, and that&#10;made Babette happy. It amused her to discover all the feelings of&#10;his heart; the strong points and weak ones. Love was to her as yet&#10;only a pastime, and she played with Rudy&#39;s whole heart. At the same&#10;time it must be acknowledged that her fortune, her whole life, her&#10;inmost thoughts, her best and most noble feelings in this world&#10;were all for him. Still the more gloomy he looked, the more her&#10;eyes laughed. She could almost have kissed the fair Englishman,&#10;with the golden whiskers, if by so doing she could have put Rudy in&#10;a rage, and made him run out of the house. That would have proved&#10;how much he loved her. All this was not right in Babette, but she&#10;was only nineteen years of age, and she did not reflect on what she&#10;did, neither did she think that her conduct would appear to the&#10;young Englishman as light, and not even becoming the modest and&#10;much-loved daughter of the miller.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The mill at Bex stood in the highway, which passed under&#10;the snow-clad mountains, and not far from a rapid mountain-stream,&#10;whose waters seemed to have been lashed into a foam like soap-suds.&#10;This stream, however, did not pass near enough to the mill, and&#10;therefore the mill-wheel was turned by a smaller stream which&#10;tumbled down the rocks on the opposite side, where it was opposed&#10;by a stone mill-dam, and obtained greater strength and speed, till&#10;it fell into a large basin, and from thence through a channel to&#10;the mill-wheel. This channel sometimes overflowed, and made the&#10;path so slippery that any one passing that way might easily fall&#10;in, and be carried towards the mill wheel with frightful rapidity.&#10;Such a catastrophe nearly happened to the young Englishman. He had&#10;dressed himself in white clothes, like a miller&#39;s man, and was&#10;climbing the path to the miller&#39;s house, but he had never been&#10;taught to climb, and therefore slipped, and nearly went in&#10;head-foremost. He managed, however, to scramble out with wet&#10;sleeves and bespattered trousers. Still, wet and splashed with mud,&#10;he contrived to reach Babette&#39;s window, to which he had been guided&#10;by the light that shone from it. Here he climbed the old&#10;linden-tree that stood near it, and began to imitate the voice of&#10;an owl, the only bird he could venture to mimic. Babette heard the&#10;noise, and glanced through the thin window curtain; but when she&#10;saw the man in white, and guessed who he was, her little heart beat&#10;with terror as well as anger. She quickly put out the light, felt&#10;if the fastening of the window was secure, and then left him to&#10;howl as long as he liked. How dreadful it would be, thought&#10;Babette, if Rudy were here in the house. But Rudy was not in the&#10;house. No, it was much worse, he was outside, standing just under&#10;the linden-tree. He was speaking loud, angry words. He could fight,&#10;and there might be murder! Babette opened the window in alarm, and&#10;called Rudy&#39;s name; she told him to go away, she did not wish him&#10;to remain there.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You do not wish me to stay,&#34; cried he; &#34;then this is an&#10;appointment you expected&#8212;this good friend whom you prefer to me.&#10;Shame on you, Babette!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You are detestable!&#34; exclaimed Babette, bursting into&#10;tears. &#34;Go away. I hate you.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I have not deserved this,&#34; said Rudy, as he turned away,&#10;his cheeks burning, and his heart like fire.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Babette threw herself on the bed, and wept bitterly. &#34;So&#10;much as I loved thee, Rudy, and yet thou canst think ill of&#10;me.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Thus her anger broke forth; it relieved her, however:&#10;otherwise she would have been more deeply grieved; but now she&#10;could sleep soundly, as youth only can sleep.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('Evil Powers'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Rudy left Bex, and took his way home along the mountain&#10;path. The air was fresh, but cold; for here amidst the deep snow,&#10;the Ice Maiden reigned. He was so high up that the large trees&#10;beneath him, with their thick foliage, appeared like garden plants,&#10;and the pines and bushes even less. The Alpine roses grew near the&#10;snow, which lay in detached stripes, and looked like linen laid out&#10;to bleach. A blue gentian grew in his path, and he crushed it with&#10;the butt end of his gun. A little higher up, he espied two chamois.&#10;Rudy&#39;s eyes glistened, and his thoughts flew at once in a different&#10;direction; but he was not near enough to take a sure aim. He&#10;ascended still higher, to a spot where a few rough blades of grass&#10;grew between the blocks of stone and the chamois passed quietly on&#10;over the snow-fields. Rudy walked hurriedly, while the clouds of&#10;mist gathered round him. Suddenly he found himself on the brink of&#10;a precipitous rock. The rain was falling in torrents. He felt a&#10;burning thirst, his head was hot, and his limbs trembled with cold.&#10;He seized his hunting-flask, but it was empty; he had not thought&#10;of filling it before ascending the mountain. He had never been ill&#10;in his life, nor ever experienced such sensations as those he now&#10;felt. He was so tired that he could scarcely resist lying down at&#10;his full length to sleep, although the ground was flooded with the&#10;rain. Yet when he tried to rouse himself a little, every object&#10;around him danced and trembled before his eyes.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Suddenly he observed in the doorway of a hut newly built&#10;under the rock, a young maiden. He did not remember having seen&#10;this hut before, yet there it stood; and he thought, at first, that&#10;the young maiden was Annette, the schoolmaster&#39;s daughter, whom he&#10;had once kissed in the dance. The maiden was not Annette; yet it&#10;seemed as if he had seen her somewhere before, perhaps near&#10;Grindelwald, on the evening of his return home from Interlachen,&#10;after the shooting-match.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;How did you come here?&#34; he asked.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I am at home,&#34; she replied; &#34;I am watching my&#10;flocks.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Your flocks!&#34; he exclaimed; &#34;where do they find pasture?&#10;There is nothing here but snow and rocks.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Much you know of what grows here,&#34; she replied, laughing.&#10;&#34;not far beneath us there is beautiful pasture-land. My goats go&#10;there. I tend them carefully; I never miss one. What is once mine&#10;remains mine.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You are bold,&#34; said Rudy.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And so are you,&#34; she answered.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Have you any milk in the house?&#34; he asked; &#34;if so, give&#10;me some to drink; my thirst is intolerable.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I have something better than milk,&#34; she replied, &#34;which I&#10;will give you. Some travellers who were here yesterday with their&#10;guide left behind them a half a flask of wine, such as you have&#10;never tasted. They will not come back to fetch it, I know, and I&#10;shall not drink it; so you shall have it.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the maiden went to fetch the wine, poured some into a&#10;wooden cup, and offered it to Rudy.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;How good it is!&#34; said he; &#34;I have never before tasted&#10;such warm, invigorating wine.&#34; And his eyes sparkled with new life;&#10;a glow diffused itself over his frame; it seemed as if every&#10;sorrow, every oppression were banished from his mind, and a fresh,&#10;free nature were stirring within him. &#34;You are surely Annette, the&#10;schoolmaster&#39;s daughter,&#34; cried he; &#34;will you give me a&#10;kiss?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, if you will give me that beautiful ring which you&#10;wear on your finger.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;My betrothal ring?&#34; he replied.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, just so,&#34; said the maiden, as she poured out some&#10;more wine, and held it to his lips. Again he drank, and a living&#10;joy streamed through every vein.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The whole world is mine, why therefore should I grieve?&#34;&#10;thought he. &#34;Everything is created for our enjoyment and happiness.&#10;The stream of life is a stream of happiness; let us flow on with it&#10;to joy and felicity.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Rudy gazed on the young maiden; it was Annette, and yet it&#10;was not Annette; still less did he suppose it was the spectral&#10;phantom, whom he had met near Grindelwald. The maiden up here on&#10;the mountain was fresh as the new fallen snow, blooming as an&#10;Alpine rose, and as nimble-footed as a young kid. Still, she was&#10;one of Adam&#39;s race, like Rudy. He flung his arms round the&#10;beautiful being, and gazed into her wonderfully clear eyes,&#8212;only&#10;for a moment; but in that moment words cannot express the effect of&#10;his gaze. Was it the spirit of life or of death that overpowered&#10;him? Was he rising higher, or sinking lower and lower into the&#10;deep, deadly abyss? He knew not; but the walls of ice shone like&#10;blue-green glass; innumerable clefts yawned around him, and the&#10;water-drops tinkled like the chiming of church bells, and shone&#10;clearly as pearls in the light of a pale-blue flame. The Ice&#10;Maiden, for she it was, kissed him, and her kiss sent a chill as of&#10;ice through his whole frame. A cry of agony escaped from him; he&#10;struggled to get free, and tottered from her. For a moment all was&#10;dark before his eyes, but when he opened them again it was light,&#10;and the Alpine maiden had vanished. The powers of evil had played&#10;their game; the sheltering hut was no more to be seen. The water&#10;trickled down the naked sides of the rocks, and snow lay thickly&#10;all around. Rudy shivered with cold; he was wet through to the&#10;skin; and his ring was gone,&#8212;the betrothal ring that Babette had&#10;given him. His gun lay near him in the snow; he took it up and&#10;tried to discharge it, but it missed fire. Heavy clouds lay on the&#10;mountain clefts, like firm masses of snow. Upon one of these&#10;Vertigo sat, lurking after his powerless prey, and from beneath&#10;came a sound as if a piece of rock had fallen from the cleft, and&#10;was crushing everything that stood in its way or opposed its&#10;course.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But, at the miller&#39;s, Babette sat alone and wept. Rudy had&#10;not been to see her for six days.

Rudy knew this, and thought a great deal about it. What&#10;was it that had happened to him on the mountain? Was it really a&#10;ghostly apparition, or a fever dream? Rudy knew nothing of fever,&#10;or any other ailment. But, while he judged Babette, he began to&#10;examine his own conduct. He had allowed wild thoughts to chase each&#10;other in his heart, and a fierce tornado to break loose. Could he&#10;confess to Babette, indeed, every thought which in the hour of&#10;temptation might have led him to wrong doing? He had lost her ring,&#10;and that very loss had won him back to her. Could she expect him to&#10;confess? He felt as if his heart would break while he thought of&#10;it, and while so many memories lingered on his mind. He saw her&#10;again, as she once stood before him, a laughing, spirited child;&#10;many loving words, which she had spoken to him out of the fulness&#10;of her love, came like a ray of sunshine into his heart, and soon&#10;it was all sunshine as he thought of Babette. But she must also&#10;confess she was wrong; that she should do.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;He went to the mill&#8212;he went to confession. It began with a&#10;kiss, and ended with Rudy being considered the offender. It was&#10;such a great fault to doubt Babette&#39;s truth&#8212;it was most abominable&#10;of him. Such mistrust, such violence, would cause them both great&#10;unhappiness. This certainly was very true, she knew that; and&#10;therefore Babette preached him a little sermon, with which she was&#10;herself much amused, and during the preaching of which she looked&#10;quite lovely. She acknowledged, however, that on one point Rudy was&#10;right. Her godmother&#39;s nephew was a fop: she intended to burn the&#10;book which he had given her, so that not the slightest thing should&#10;remain to remind her of him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Well, that quarrel is all over,&#34; said the kitchen-cat.&#10;&#34;Rudy is come back, and they are friends again, which they say is&#10;the greatest of all pleasures.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I heard the rats say one night,&#34; said the kitchen-cat,&#10;&#34;that the greatest pleasure in the world was to eat tallow candles&#10;and to feast on rancid bacon. Which are we to believe, the rats or&#10;the lovers?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Neither of them,&#34; said the parlor-cat; &#34;it is always the&#10;safest plan to believe nothing you hear.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The greatest happiness was coming for Rudy and Babette.&#10;The happy day, as it is called, that is, their wedding-day, was&#10;near at hand. They were not to be married at the church at Bex, nor&#10;at the miller&#39;s house; Babette&#39;s godmother wished the nuptials to&#10;be solemnized at Montreux, in the pretty little church in that&#10;town. The miller was very anxious that this arrangement should be&#10;agreed to. He alone knew what the newly-married couple would&#10;receive from Babette&#39;s godmother, and he knew also that it was a&#10;wedding present well worth a concession. The day was fixed, and&#10;they were to travel as far as Villeneuve the evening before, to be&#10;in time for the steamer which sailed in the morning for Montreux,&#10;and the godmother&#39;s daughters were to dress and adorn the&#10;bride.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Here in this house there ought to be a wedding-day kept,&#34;&#10;said the parlor-cat, &#34;or else I would not give a mew for the whole&#10;affair.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;There is going to be great feasting,&#34; replied the&#10;kitchen-cat. &#34;Ducks and pigeons have been killed, and a whole&#10;roebuck hangs on the wall.

Text.create(:title => coder.decode('Night Visions'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The sun had gone down, and the clouds lay low on the&#10;valley of the Rhone. The wind blew from the south across the&#10;mountains; it was an African wind, a wind which scattered the&#10;clouds for a moment, and then suddenly fell. The broken clouds hung&#10;in fantastic forms upon the wood-covered hills by the rapid Rhone.&#10;They assumed the shapes of antediluvian animals, of eagles hovering&#10;in the air, of frogs leaping over a marsh, and then sunk down upon&#10;the rushing stream and appeared to sail upon it, although floating&#10;in the air. An uprooted fir-tree was being carried away by the&#10;current, and marking out its path by eddying circles on the water.&#10;Vertigo and his sisters were dancing upon it, and raising these&#10;circles on the foaming river. The moon lighted up the snow on the&#10;mountain-tops, shone on the dark woods, and on the drifting clouds&#10;those fantastic forms which at night might be taken for spirits of&#10;the powers of nature. The mountain-dweller saw them through the&#10;panes of his little window. They sailed in hosts before the Ice&#10;Maiden as she came out of her palace of ice. Then she seated&#10;herself on the trunk of the fir-tree as on a broken skiff, and the&#10;water from the glaciers carried her down the river to the open&#10;lake.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The wedding guests are coming,&#34; sounded from air and sea.&#10;These were the sights and sounds without; within there were&#10;visions, for Babette had a wonderful dream. She dreamt that she had&#10;been married to Rudy for many years, and that, one day when he was&#10;out chamois hunting, and she alone in their dwelling at home, the&#10;young Englishman with the golden whiskers sat with her. His eyes&#10;were quite eloquent, and his words possessed a magic power; he&#10;offered her his hand, and she was obliged to follow him. They went&#10;out of the house and stepped downwards, always downwards, and it&#10;seemed to Babette as if she had a weight on her heart which&#10;continually grew heavier. She felt she was committing a sin against&#10;Rudy, a sin against God. Suddenly she found herself forsaken, her&#10;clothes torn by the thorns, and her hair gray; she looked upwards&#10;in her agony, and there, on the edge of the rock, she espied Rudy.&#10;She stretched out her arms to him, but she did not venture to call&#10;him or to pray; and had she called him, it would have been useless,&#10;for it was not Rudy, only his hunting coat and hat hanging on an&#10;alpenstock, as the hunters sometimes arrange them to deceive the&#10;chamois. &#34;Oh!&#34; she exclaimed in her agony; &#34;oh, that I had died on&#10;the happiest day of my life, my wedding-day. O my God, it would&#10;have been a mercy and a blessing had Rudy travelled far away from&#10;me, and I had never known him. None know what will happen in the&#10;future.&#34; And then, in ungodly despair, she cast herself down into&#10;the deep rocky gulf. The spell was broken; a cry of terror escaped&#10;her, and she awoke.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The dream was over; it had vanished. But she knew she had&#10;dreamt something frightful about the young Englishman, yet months&#10;had passed since she had seen him or even thought of him. Was he&#10;still at Montreux, and should she meet him there on her wedding&#10;day? A slight shadow passed over her pretty mouth as she thought of&#10;this, and she knit her brows; but the smile soon returned to her&#10;lip, and joy sparkled in her eyes, for this was the morning of the&#10;day on which she and Rudy were to be married, and the sun was&#10;shining brightly. Rudy was already in the parlor when she entered&#10;it, and they very soon started for Villeneuve. Both of them were&#10;overflowing with happiness, and the miller was in the best of&#10;tempers, laughing and merry; he was a good, honest soul, and a kind&#10;father.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Now we are masters of the house,&#34; said the&#10;parlor-cat.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('The Conclusion'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was early in the afternoon, and just at dinner-time,&#10;when the three joyous travellers reached Villeneuve. After dinner,&#10;the miller placed himself in the arm-chair, smoked his pipe, and&#10;had a little nap. The bridal pair went arm-in-arm out through the&#10;town and along the high road, at the foot of the wood-covered&#10;rocks, and by the deep, blue lake.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The gray walls, and the heavy clumsy-looking towers of the&#10;gloomy castle of Chillon, were reflected in the clear flood. The&#10;little island, on which grew the three acacias, lay at a short&#10;distance, looking like a bouquet rising from the lake. &#34;How&#10;delightful it must be to live there,&#34; said Babette, who again felt&#10;the greatest wish to visit the island; and an opportunity offered&#10;to gratify her wish at once, for on the shore lay a boat, and the&#10;rope by which it was moored could be very easily loosened. They saw&#10;no one near, so they took possession of it without asking&#10;permission of any one, and Rudy could row very well. The oars&#10;divided the pliant water like the fins of a fish&#8212;that water which,&#10;with all its yielding softness, is so strong to bear and to carry,&#10;so mild and smiling when at rest, and yet so terrible in its&#10;destroying power. A white streak of foam followed in the wake of&#10;the boat, which, in a few minutes, carried them both to the little&#10;island, where they went on shore; but there was only just room&#10;enough for two to dance. Rudy swung Babette round two or three&#10;times; and then, hand-in-hand, they sat down on a little bench&#10;under the drooping acacia-tree, and looked into each other&#39;s eyes,&#10;while everything around them glowed in the rays of the setting&#10;sun.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The fir-tree forests on the mountains were covered with a&#10;purple hue like the heather bloom; and where the woods terminated,&#10;and the rocks became prominent, they looked almost transparent in&#10;the rich crimson glow of the evening sky. The surface of the lake&#10;was like a bed of pink rose-leaves.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;As the evening advanced, the shadows fell upon the&#10;snow-capped mountains of Savoy painting them in colors of deep&#10;blue, while their topmost peaks glowed like red lava; and for a&#10;moment this light was reflected on the cultivated parts of the&#10;mountains, making them appear as if newly risen from the lap of&#10;earth, and giving to the snow-crested peak of the Dent du Midi the&#10;appearance of the full moon as it rises above the&#10;horizon.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Rudy and Babette felt that they had never seen the Alpine&#10;glow in such perfection before. &#34;How very beautiful it is, and what&#10;happiness to be here!&#34; exclaimed Babette.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Earth has nothing more to bestow upon me,&#34; said Rudy; &#34;an&#10;evening like this is worth a whole life. Often have I realized my&#10;good fortune, but never more than in this moment. I feel that if my&#10;existence were to end now, I should still have lived a happy life.&#10;What a glorious world this is; one day ends, and another begins&#10;even more beautiful than the last. How infinitely good God is,&#10;Babette!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I have such complete happiness in my heart,&#34; said&#10;she.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Earth has no more to bestow,&#34; answered Rudy. And then&#10;came the sound of the evening bells, borne upon the breeze over the&#10;mountains of Switzerland and Savoy, while still, in the golden&#10;splendor of the west, stood the dark blue mountains of&#10;Jura.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;God grant you all that is brightest and best!&#34; exclaimed&#10;Babette.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;He will,&#34; said Rudy. &#34;He will to-morrow. To-morrow you&#10;will be wholly mine, my own sweet wife.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The boat!&#34; cried Babette, suddenly. The boat in which&#10;they were to return had broken loose, and was floating away from&#10;the island.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I will fetch it back,&#34; said Rudy; throwing off his coat&#10;and boots, he sprang into the lake, and swam with strong efforts&#10;towards it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The dark-blue water, from the glaciers of the mountains,&#10;was icy cold and very deep. Rudy gave but one glance into the water&#10;beneath; but in that one glance he saw a gold ring rolling,&#10;glittering, and sparkling before him. His engaged ring came into&#10;his mind; but this was larger, and spread into a glittering circle,&#10;in which appeared a clear glacier. Deep chasms yawned around it,&#10;the water-drops glittered as if lighted with blue flame, and&#10;tinkled like the chiming of church bells. In one moment he saw what&#10;would require many words to describe. Young hunters, and young&#10;maidens&#8212;men and women who had sunk in the deep chasms of the&#10;glaciers&#8212;stood before him here in lifelike forms, with eyes open&#10;and smiles on their lips; and far beneath them could be heard the&#10;chiming of the church bells of buried villages, where the villagers&#10;knelt beneath the vaulted arches of churches in which ice-blocks&#10;formed the organ pipes, and the mountain stream the&#10;music.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;On the clear, transparent ground sat the Ice Maiden. She&#10;raised herself towards Rudy, and kissed his feet; and instantly a&#10;cold, deathly chill, like an electric shock, passed through his&#10;limbs. Ice or fire! It was impossible to tell, the shock was so&#10;instantaneous.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Mine! mine!&#34; sounded around him, and within him; &#34;I&#10;kissed thee when thou wert a little child. I once kissed thee on&#10;the mouth, and now I have kissed thee from heel to toe; thou art&#10;wholly mine.&#34; And then he disappeared in the clear, blue&#10;water.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;All was still. The church bells were silent; the last tone&#10;floated away with the last red glimmer on the evening clouds. &#34;Thou&#10;art mine,&#34; sounded from the depths below: but from the heights&#10;above, from the eternal world, also sounded the words, &#34;Thou art&#10;mine!&#34; Happy was he thus to pass from life to life, from earth to&#10;heaven. A chord was loosened, and tones of sorrow burst forth. The&#10;icy kiss of death had overcome the perishable body; it was but the&#10;prelude before life&#39;s real drama could begin, the discord which was&#10;quickly lost in harmony. Do you think this a sad story? Poor&#10;Babette! for her it was unspeakable anguish.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The boat drifted farther and farther away. No one on the&#10;opposite shore knew that the betrothed pair had gone over to the&#10;little island. The clouds sunk as the evening drew on, and it&#10;became dark. Alone, in despair, she waited and trembled. The&#10;weather became fearful; flash after flash lighted up the mountains&#10;of Jura, Savoy, and Switzerland, while peals of thunder, that&#10;lasted for many minutes, rolled over her head. The lightning was so&#10;vivid that every single vine stem could be seen for a moment as&#10;distinctly as in the sunlight at noon-day; and then all was veiled&#10;in darkness. It flashed across the lake in winding, zigzag lines,&#10;lighting it up on all sides; while the echoes of the thunder grew&#10;louder and stronger. On land, the boats were all carefully drawn up&#10;on the beach, every living thing sought shelter, and at length the&#10;rain poured down in torrents.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Where can Rudy and Babette be in this awful weather?&#34;&#10;said the miller.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Poor Babette sat with her hands clasped, and her head&#10;bowed down, dumb with grief; she had ceased to weep and cry for&#10;help.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;In the deep water!&#34; she said to herself; &#34;far down he&#10;lies, as if beneath a glacier.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Deep in her heart rested the memory of what Rudy had told&#10;her of the death of his mother, and of his own recovery, even after&#10;he had been taken up as dead from the cleft in the&#10;glacier.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ah,&#34; she thought, &#34;the Ice Maiden has him at&#10;last.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Suddenly there came a flash of lightning, as dazzling as&#10;the rays of the sun on the white snow. The lake rose for a moment&#10;like a shining glacier; and before Babette stood the pallid,&#10;glittering, majestic form of the Ice Maiden, and at her feet lay&#10;Rudy&#39;s corpse.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Mine!&#34; she cried, and again all was darkness around the&#10;heaving water.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;How cruel,&#34; murmured Babette; &#34;why should he die just as&#10;the day of happiness drew near? Merciful God, enlighten my&#10;understanding, shed light upon my heart; for I cannot comprehend&#10;the arrangements of Thy providence, even while I bow to the decree&#10;of Thy almighty wisdom and power.&#34; And God did enlighten her&#10;heart.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A sudden flash of thought, like a ray of mercy, recalled&#10;her dream of the preceding night; all was vividly represented&#10;before her. She remembered the words and wishes she had then&#10;expressed, that what was best for her and for Rudy she might&#10;piously submit to.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Woe is me,&#34; she said; &#34;was the germ of sin really in my&#10;heart? was my dream a glimpse into the course of my future life,&#10;whose thread must be violently broken to rescue me from sin? Oh,&#10;miserable creature that I am!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Thus she sat lamenting in the dark night, while through&#10;the deep stillness the last words of Rudy seemed to ring in her&#10;ears. &#34;This earth has nothing more to bestow.&#34; Words, uttered in&#10;the fulness of joy, were again heard amid the depths of&#10;sorrow.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Years have passed since this sad event happened. The&#10;shores of the peaceful lake still smile in beauty. The vines are&#10;full of luscious grapes. Steamboats, with waving flags, pass&#10;swiftly by. Pleasure-boats, with their swelling sails, skim lightly&#10;over the watery mirror, like white butterflies. The railway is&#10;opened beyond Chillon, and goes far into the deep valley of the&#10;Rhone. At every station strangers alight with red-bound guide-books&#10;in their hands, in which they read of every place worth seeing.&#10;They visit Chillon, and observe on the lake the little island with&#10;the three acacias, and then read in their guide-book the story of&#10;the bridal pair who, in the year 1856, rowed over to it. They read&#10;that the two were missing till the next morning, when some people&#10;on the shore heard the despairing cries of the bride, and went to&#10;her assistance, and by her were told of the bridegroom&#39;s&#10;fate.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But the guide-book does not speak of Babette&#39;s quiet life&#10;afterwards with her father, not at the mill&#8212;strangers dwell there&#10;now&#8212;but in a pretty house in a row near the station. On many an&#10;evening she sits at her window, and looks out over the&#10;chestnut-trees to the snow-capped mountains on which Rudy once&#10;roamed. She looks at the Alpine glow in the evening sky, which is&#10;caused by the children of the sun retiring to rest on the&#10;mountain-tops; and again they breathe their song of the traveller&#10;whom the whirlwind could deprive of his cloak but not of his life.&#10;There is a rosy tint on the mountain snow, and there are rosy&#10;gleams in each heart in which dwells the thought, &#34;God permits&#10;nothing to happen, which is not the best for us.&#34; But this is not&#10;often revealed to all, as it was revealed to Babette in her&#10;wonderful dream.&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode(''), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;IN a charity school, among the children, sat a little&#10;Jewish girl. She was a good, intelligent child, and very quick at&#10;her lessons; but the Scripture-lesson class she was not allowed to&#10;join, for this was a Christian school. During the hour of this&#10;lesson, the Jewish girl was allowed to learn her geography, or to&#10;work her sum for the next day; and when her geography lesson was&#10;perfect, the book remained open before her, but she read not&#10;another word, for she sat silently listening to the words of the&#10;Christian teacher. He soon became aware that the little one was&#10;paying more attention to what he said than most of the other&#10;children. &#34;Read your book, Sarah,&#34; he said to her&#10;gently.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But again and again he saw her dark, beaming eyes fixed&#10;upon him; and once, when he asked her a question, she could answer&#10;him even better than the other children. She had not only heard,&#10;but understood his words, and pondered them in her heart. Her&#10;father, a poor but honest man, had placed his daughter at the&#10;school on the conditions that she should not be instructed in the&#10;Christian faith. But it might have caused confusion, or raised&#10;discontent in the minds of the other children if she had been sent&#10;out of the room, so she remained; and now it was evident this could&#10;not go on. The teacher went to her father, and advised him to&#10;remove his daughter from the school, or to allow her to become a&#10;Christian. &#34;I cannot any longer be an idle spectator of those&#10;beaming eyes, which express such a deep and earnest longing for the&#10;words of the gospel,&#34; said he.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the father burst into tears. &#34;I know very little of&#10;the law of my fathers,&#34; said he; &#34;but Sarah&#39;s mother was firm in&#10;her belief as a daughter of Israel, and I vowed to her on her&#10;deathbed that our child should never be baptized. I must keep my&#10;vow: it is to me even as a covenant with God Himself.&#34; And so the&#10;little Jewish girl left the Christian school.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Years rolled by. In one of the smallest provincial towns,&#10;in a humble household, lived a poor maiden of the Jewish faith, as&#10;a servant. Her hair was black as ebony, her eye dark as night, yet&#10;full of light and brilliancy so peculiar to the daughters of the&#10;east. It was Sarah. The expression in the face of the grown-up&#10;maiden was still the same as when, a child, she sat on the&#10;schoolroom form listening with thoughtful eyes to the words of the&#10;Christian teacher. Every Sunday there sounded forth from a church&#10;close by the tones of an organ and the singing of the congregation.&#10;The Jewish girl heard them in the house where, industrious and&#10;faithful in all things, she performed her household duties. &#34;Thou&#10;shalt keep the Sabbath holy,&#34; said the voice of the law in her&#10;heart; but her Sabbath was a working day among the Christians,&#10;which was a great trouble to her. And then as the thought arose in&#10;her mind, &#34;Does God reckon by days and hours?&#34; her conscience felt&#10;satisfied on this question, and she found it a comfort to her, that&#10;on the Christian Sabbath she could have an hour for her own prayers&#10;undisturbed. The music and singing of the congregation sounded in&#10;her ears while at work in her kitchen, till the place itself became&#10;sacred to her. Then she would read in the Old Testament, that&#10;treasure and comfort to her people, and it was indeed the only&#10;Scriptures she could read. Faithfully in her inmost thoughts had&#10;she kept the words of her father to her teacher when she left the&#10;school, and the vow he had made to her dying mother that she should&#10;never receive Christian baptism. The New Testament must remain to&#10;her a sealed book, and yet she knew a great deal of its teaching,&#10;and the sound of the gospel truths still lingered among the&#10;recollections of her childhood.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;One evening she was sitting in a corner of the&#10;dining-room, while her master read aloud. It was not the gospel he&#10;read, but an old story-book; therefore she might stay and listen to&#10;him. The story related that a Hungarian knight, who had been taken&#10;prisoner by a Turkish pasha, was most cruelly treated by him. He&#10;caused him to be yoked with his oxen to the plough, and driven with&#10;blows from the whip till the blood flowed, and he almost sunk with&#10;exhaustion and pain. The faithful wife of the knight at home gave&#10;up all her jewels, mortgaged her castle and land, and his friends&#10;raised large sums to make up the ransom demanded for his release,&#10;which was most enormously high. It was collected at last, and the&#10;knight released from slavery and misery. Sick and exhausted, he&#10;reached home.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Ere long came another summons to a struggle with the foes&#10;of Christianity. The still living knight heard the sound; he could&#10;endure no more, he had neither peace nor rest. He caused himself to&#10;be lifted on his war-horse; the color came into his cheeks, and his&#10;strength returned to him again as he went forth to battle and to&#10;victory. The very same pasha who had yoked him to the plough,&#10;became his prisoner, and was dragged to a dungeon in the castle.&#10;But an hour had scarcely passed, when the knight stood before the&#10;captive pasha, and inquired, &#34;What do you suppose awaiteth&#10;thee?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I know,&#34; replied the pasha; &#34;retribution.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, the retribution of a Christian,&#34; replied the knight.&#10;&#34;The teaching of Christ, the Teacher, commands us to forgive our&#10;enemies, to love our neighbors; for God is love. Depart in peace:&#10;return to thy home. I give thee back to thy loved ones. But in&#10;future be mild and humane to all who are in trouble.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the prisoner burst into tears, and exclaimed, &#34;Oh how&#10;could I imagine such mercy and forgiveness! I expected pain and&#10;torment. It seemed to me so sure that I took poison, which I&#10;secretly carried about me; and in a few hours its effects will&#10;destroy me. I must die! Nothing can save me! But before I die,&#10;explain to me the teaching which is so full of love and mercy, so&#10;great and God-like. Oh, that I may hear his teaching, and die a&#10;Christian!&#34; And his prayer was granted.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;This was the legend which the master read out of the old&#10;story-book. Every one in the house who was present listened, and&#10;shared the pleasure; but Sarah, the Jewish girl, sitting so still&#10;in a corner, felt her heart burn with excitement. Great tears came&#10;into her shining dark eyes; and with the same gentle piety with&#10;which she had once listened to the gospel while sitting on the form&#10;at school, she felt its grandeur now, and the tears rolled down her&#10;cheeks. Then the last words of her dying mother rose before her,&#10;&#34;Let not my child become a Christian;&#34; and with them sounded in her&#10;heart the words of the law, &#34;Honor thy father and thy&#10;mother.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I am not admitted among the Christians,&#34; she said; &#34;they&#10;mock me as a Jewish girl; the neighbors&#39; boys did so last Sunday&#10;when I stood looking in through the open church door at the candles&#10;burning on the altar, and listening to the singing. Ever since I&#10;sat on the school-bench I have felt the power of Christianity; a&#10;power which, like a sunbeam, streams into my heart, however closely&#10;I may close my eyes against it. But I will not grieve thee, my&#10;mother, in thy grave. I will not be unfaithful to my father&#39;s vow.&#10;I will not read the Bible of the Christian. I have the God of my&#10;fathers, and in Him I will trust.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And again years passed by. Sarah&#39;s master died, and his&#10;widow found herself in such reduced circumstances that she wished&#10;to dismiss her servant maid; but Sarah refused to leave the house,&#10;and she became a true support in time of trouble, and kept the&#10;household together by working till late at night, with her busy&#10;hands, to earn their daily bread. Not a relative came forward to&#10;assist them, and the widow was confined to a sick bed for months&#10;and grew weaker from day to day. Sarah worked hard, but contrived&#10;to spare time to amuse her and watch by the sick bed. She was&#10;gentle and pious, an angel of blessing in that house of&#10;poverty.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;My Bible lies on the table yonder,&#34; said the sick woman&#10;one day to Sarah. &#34;Read me something from it; the night appears so&#10;long, and my spirit thirsts to hear the word of God.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And Sarah bowed her head. She took the book, and folded&#10;her hand over the Bible of the Christians, and at last opened it,&#10;and read to the sick woman. Tears stood in her eyes as she read,&#10;and they shone with brightness, for in her heart it was&#10;light.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Mother,&#34; she murmured, &#34;thy child may not receive&#10;Christian baptism, nor be admitted into the congregation of&#10;Christian people. Thou hast so willed it, and I will respect thy&#10;command. We are therefore still united here on earth; but in the&#10;next world there will be a higher union, even with God Himself, who&#10;leads and guides His people till death. He came down from heaven to&#10;earth to suffer for us, that we should bring forth the fruits of&#10;repentance. I understand it now. I know not how I learnt this&#10;truth, unless it is through the name of Christ.&#34; Yet she trembled&#10;as she pronounced the holy name. She struggled against these&#10;convictions of the truth of Christianity for some days, till one&#10;evening while watching her mistress she was suddenly taken very&#10;ill; her limbs tottered under her, and she sank fainting by the&#10;bedside of the sick woman.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Poor Sarah,&#34; said the neighbors; &#34;she is overcome with&#10;hard work and night watching.&#34; And then they carried her to the&#10;hospital for the sick poor. There she died; and they bore her to&#10;her resting-place in the earth, but not to the churchyard of the&#10;Christians. There was no place for the Jewish girl; but they dug a&#10;grave for her outside the wall. And God&#39;s sun, which shines upon&#10;the graves of the churchyard of the Christians, also throws its&#10;beams on the grave of the Jewish maiden beyond the wall. And when&#10;the psalms of the Christians sound across the churchyard, their&#10;echo reaches her lonely resting-place; and she who sleeps there&#10;will be counted worthy at the resurrection, through the name of&#10;Christ the Lord, who said to His disciples, &#34;John baptized you with&#10;water, but I will baptize you with the Holy Ghost.&#34;&#10;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')

And&#10;there the three famous jumpers were met together in the&#10;room.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, I&#39;ll give my daughter to him who jumps highest,&#34;&#10;said the King, &#34;for it would be mean to let these people jump for&#10;nothing.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Flea stepped out first. He had very pretty manners,&#10;and bowed in all directions, for he had young ladies&#39; blood in his&#10;veins, and was accustomed to consort only with human beings; and&#10;that was of great consequence.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then came the Grasshopper: he was certainly much heavier,&#10;but he had a good figure, and wore the green uniform that was born&#10;with him. This person, moreover, maintained that he belonged to a&#10;very old family in the land of Egypt, and that he was highly&#10;esteemed there. He had just come from the field, he said, and had&#10;been put into a card house three stories high, and all made of&#10;picture cards with the figures turned inwards. There were doors and&#10;windows in the house, cut in the body of the Queen of&#10;Hearts.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I sing so,&#34; he said, &#34;that sixteen native crickets who&#10;have chirped from their youth up, and have never yet had a card&#10;house of their own, would become thinner than they are with envy if&#10;they were to hear me.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Both of them, the Flea and the Grasshopper, took care to&#10;announce who they were, and that they considered themselves&#10;entitled to marry a Princess.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Skipjack said nothing, but it was said of him that he&#10;thought all the more; and directly the Yard Dog had smelt at him he&#10;was ready to assert that the Skipjack was of good family, and&#10;formed from the breastbone of an undoubted goose. The old&#10;councillor, who had received three medals for holding his tongue,&#10;declared that the Skipjack possessed the gift of prophecy; one&#10;could tell by his bones whether there would be a severe winter or a&#10;mild one; and that&#39;s more than one can always tell from the&#10;breastbone of the man who writes the almanac.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I shall not say anything more,&#34; said the old King. &#34;I&#10;only go on quietly, and always think the best.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Now they were to take their jump. The Flea sprang so high&#10;that no one could see him; and then they asserted that he had not&#10;jumped at all. That was very mean. The Grasshopper only sprang half&#10;as high, but he sprang straight into the King&#39;s face, and the King&#10;declared that was horribly rude. The Skipjack stood a long time&#10;considering; at last people thought that he could not jump at&#10;all.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I only hope he&#39;s not become unwell,&#34; said the Yard Dog,&#10;and then he smelt at him again.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Tap!&#34; he sprang with a little crooked jump just into the&#10;lap of the Princess, who sat on a low golden stool.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the King said, &#34;The highest leap was taken by him who&#10;jumped up to my daughter; for therein lies the point; but it&#10;requires head to achieve that, and the Skipjack has shown that he&#10;has a head.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And so he had the Princess.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I jumped highest, after all,&#34; said the Flea. &#34;But it&#39;s&#10;all the same. Let her have the goose-bone with its lump of wax and&#10;bit of stick. I jumped to the highest; but in this world a body is&#10;required if one wishes to be seen.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the Flea went into foreign military service, where it&#10;is said he was killed.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Grasshopper seated himself out in the ditch, and&#10;thought and considered how things happened in the world. And he too&#10;said, &#34;Body is required! body is required!&#34; And then he sang his&#10;own melancholy song, and from that we have gathered this story,&#10;which they say is not true, though it&#39;s in print. &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode(''), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;IN the forest, high up on the steep shore, and not far&#10;from the open seacoast, stood a very old oak-tree. It was just&#10;three hundred and sixty-five years old, but that long time was to&#10;the tree as the same number of days might be to us; we wake by day&#10;and sleep by night, and then we have our dreams. It is different&#10;with the tree; it is obliged to keep awake through three seasons of&#10;the year, and does not get any sleep till winter comes. Winter is&#10;its time for rest; its night after the long day of spring, summer,&#10;and autumn. On many a warm summer, the Ephemera, the flies that&#10;exist for only a day, had fluttered about the old oak, enjoyed life&#10;and felt happy and if, for a moment, one of the tiny creatures&#10;rested on one of his large fresh leaves, the tree would always say,&#10;&#34;Poor little creature! your whole life consists only of a single&#10;day. How very short. It must be quite melancholy.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Melancholy! what do you mean?&#34; the little creature would&#10;always reply. &#34;Everything around me is so wonderfully bright and&#10;warm, and beautiful, that it makes me joyous.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But only for one day, and then it is all&#10;over.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Over!&#34; repeated the fly; &#34;what is the meaning of all&#10;over? Are you all over too?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No; I shall very likely live for thousands of your days,&#10;and my day is whole seasons long; indeed it is so long that you&#10;could never reckon it out.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No? then I don&#39;t understand you. You may have thousands&#10;of my days, but I have thousands of moments in which I can be merry&#10;and happy. Does all the beauty of the world cease when you&#10;die?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No,&#34; replied the tree; &#34;it will certainly last much&#10;longer,&#8212;infinitely longer than I can even think of. &#34;Well, then,&#34;&#10;said the little fly, &#34;we have the same time to live; only we reckon&#10;differently.&#34; And the little creature danced and floated in the&#10;air, rejoicing in her delicate wings of gauze and velvet, rejoicing&#10;in the balmy breezes, laden with the fragrance of clover-fields and&#10;wild roses, elder-blossoms and honeysuckle, from the garden hedges,&#10;wild thyme, primroses, and mint, and the scent of all these was so&#10;strong that the perfume almost intoxicated the little fly. The long&#10;and beautiful day had been so full of joy and sweet delights, that&#10;when the sun sank low it felt tired of all its happiness and&#10;enjoyment. Its wings could sustain it no longer, and gently and&#10;slowly it glided down upon the soft waving blades of grass, nodded&#10;its little head as well as it could nod, and slept peacefully and&#10;sweetly. The fly was dead.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Poor little Ephemera!&#34; said the oak; &#34;what a terribly&#10;short life!&#34; And so, on every summer day the dance was repeated,&#10;the same questions asked, and the same answers given. The same&#10;thing was continued through many generations of Ephemera; all of&#10;them felt equally merry and equally happy.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The oak remained awake through the morning of spring, the&#10;noon of summer, and the evening of autumn; its time of rest, its&#10;night drew nigh&#8212;winter was coming. Already the storms were singing,&#10;&#34;Good-night, good-night.&#34; Here fell a leaf and there fell a leaf.&#10;&#34;We will rock you and lull you. Go to sleep, go to sleep. We will&#10;sing you to sleep, and shake you to sleep, and it will do your old&#10;twigs good; they will even crackle with pleasure. Sleep sweetly,&#10;sleep sweetly, it is your three-hundred-and-sixty-fifth night.&#10;Correctly speaking, you are but a youngster in the world. Sleep&#10;sweetly, the clouds will drop snow upon you, which will be quite a&#10;cover-lid, warm and sheltering to your feet. Sweet sleep to you,&#10;and pleasant dreams.&#34; And there stood the oak, stripped of all its&#10;leaves, left to rest during the whole of a long winter, and to&#10;dream many dreams of events that had happened in its life, as in&#10;the dreams of men. The great tree had once been small; indeed, in&#10;its cradle it had been an acorn. According to human computation, it&#10;was now in the fourth century of its existence. It was the largest&#10;and best tree in the forest. Its summit towered above all the other&#10;trees, and could be seen far out at sea, so that it served as a&#10;landmark to the sailors. It had no idea how many eyes looked&#10;eagerly for it. In its topmost branches the wood-pigeon built her&#10;nest, and the cuckoo carried out his usual vocal performances, and&#10;his well-known notes echoed amid the boughs; and in autumn, when&#10;the leaves looked like beaten copper plates, the birds of passage&#10;would come and rest upon the branches before taking their flight&#10;across the sea. But now it was winter, the tree stood leafless, so&#10;that every one could see how crooked and bent were the branches&#10;that sprang forth from the trunk. Crows and rooks came by turns and&#10;sat on them, and talked of the hard times which were beginning, and&#10;how difficult it was in winter to obtain food.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was just about holy Christmas time that the tree&#10;dreamed a dream. The tree had, doubtless, a kind of feeling that&#10;the festive time had arrived, and in his dream fancied he heard the&#10;bells ringing from all the churches round, and yet it seemed to him&#10;to be a beautiful summer&#39;s day, mild and warm. His mighty summits&#10;was crowned with spreading fresh green foliage; the sunbeams played&#10;among the leaves and branches, and the air was full of fragrance&#10;from herb and blossom; painted butterflies chased each other; the&#10;summer flies danced around him, as if the world had been created&#10;merely for them to dance and be merry in. All that had happened to&#10;the tree during every year of his life seemed to pass before him,&#10;as in a festive procession. He saw the knights of olden times and&#10;noble ladies ride by through the wood on their gallant steeds, with&#10;plumes waving in their hats, and falcons on their wrists. The&#10;hunting horn sounded, and the dogs barked. He saw hostile warriors,&#10;in colored dresses and glittering armor, with spear and halberd,&#10;pitching their tents, and anon striking them. The watchfires again&#10;blazed, and men sang and slept under the hospitable shelter of the&#10;tree. He saw lovers meet in quiet happiness near him in the&#10;moonshine, and carve the initials of their names in the&#10;grayish-green bark on his trunk. Once, but long years had&#10;intervened since then, guitars and Eolian harps had been hung on&#10;his boughs by merry travellers; now they seemed to hang there&#10;again, and he could hear their marvellous tones. The wood-pigeons&#10;cooed as if to explain the feelings of the tree, and the cuckoo&#10;called out to tell him how many summer days he had yet to live.&#10;Then it seemed as if new life was thrilling through every fibre of&#10;root and stem and leaf, rising even to the highest branches. The&#10;tree felt itself stretching and spreading out, while through the&#10;root beneath the earth ran the warm vigor of life. As he grew&#10;higher and still higher, with increased strength, his topmost&#10;boughs became broader and fuller; and in proportion to his growth,&#10;so was his self-satisfaction increased, and with it arose a joyous&#10;longing to grow higher and higher, to reach even to the warm,&#10;bright sun itself. Already had his topmost branches pierced the&#10;clouds, which floated beneath them like troops of birds of passage,&#10;or large white swans; every leaf seemed gifted with sight, as if it&#10;possessed eyes to see. The stars became visible in broad daylight,&#10;large and sparkling, like clear and gentle eyes. They recalled to&#10;the memory the well-known look in the eyes of a child, or in the&#10;eyes of lovers who had once met beneath the branches of the old&#10;oak. These were wonderful and happy moments for the old tree, full&#10;of peace and joy; and yet, amidst all this happiness, the tree felt&#10;a yearning, longing desire that all the other trees, bushes, herbs,&#10;and flowers beneath him, might be able also to rise higher, as he&#10;had done, and to see all this splendor, and experience the same&#10;happiness. The grand, majestic oak could not be quite happy in the&#10;midst of his enjoyment, while all the rest, both great and small,&#10;were not with him. And this feeling of yearning trembled through&#10;every branch, through every leaf, as warmly and fervently as if&#10;they had been the fibres of a human heart. The summit of the tree&#10;waved to and fro, and bent downwards as if in his silent longing he&#10;sought for something. Then there came to him the fragrance of&#10;thyme, followed by the more powerful scent of honeysuckle and&#10;violets; and he fancied he heard the note of the cuckoo. At length&#10;his longing was satisfied. Up through the clouds came the green&#10;summits of the forest trees, and beneath him, the oak saw them&#10;rising, and growing higher and higher. Bush and herb shot upward,&#10;and some even tore themselves up by the roots to rise more quickly.&#10;The birch-tree was the quickest of all. Like a lightning flash the&#10;slender stem shot upwards in a zigzag line, the branches spreading&#10;around it like green gauze and banners. Every native of the wood,&#10;even to the brown and feathery rushes, grew with the rest, while&#10;the birds ascended with the melody of song. On a blade of grass,&#10;that fluttered in the air like a long, green ribbon, sat a&#10;grasshopper, cleaning his wings with his legs. May beetles hummed,&#10;the bees murmured, the birds sang, each in his own way; the air was&#10;filled with the sounds of song and gladness.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But where is the little blue flower that grows by the&#10;water?&#34; asked the oak, &#34;and the purple bell-flower, and the daisy?&#34;&#10;You see the oak wanted to have them all with him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Here we are, we are here,&#34; sounded in voice and&#10;song.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But the beautiful thyme of last summer, where is that?&#10;and the lilies-of-the-valley, which last year covered the earth&#10;with their bloom? and the wild apple-tree with its lovely blossoms,&#10;and all the glory of the wood, which has flourished year after&#10;year? even what may have but now sprouted forth could be with us&#10;here.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;We are here, we are here,&#34; sounded voices higher in the&#10;air, as if they had flown there beforehand.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Why this is beautiful, too beautiful to be believed,&#34;&#10;said the oak in a joyful tone. &#34;I have them all here, both great&#10;and small; not one has been forgotten. Can such happiness be&#10;imagined?&#34; It seemed almost impossible.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;In heaven with the Eternal God, it can be imagined, and&#10;it is possible,&#34; sounded the reply through the air.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the old tree, as it still grew upwards and onwards,&#10;felt that his roots were loosening themselves from the&#10;earth.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It is right so, it is best,&#34; said the tree, &#34;no fetters&#10;hold me now. I can fly up to the very highest point in light and&#10;glory. And all I love are with me, both small and great. All&#8212;all&#10;are here.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Such was the dream of the old oak: and while he dreamed, a&#10;mighty storm came rushing over land and sea, at the holy Christmas&#10;time. The sea rolled in great billows towards the shore. There was&#10;a cracking and crushing heard in the tree. The root was torn from&#10;the ground just at the moment when in his dream he fancied it was&#10;being loosened from the earth. He fell&#8212;his three hundred and&#10;sixty-five years were passed as the single day of the Ephemera. On&#10;the morning of Christmas-day, when the sun rose, the storm had&#10;ceased. From all the churches sounded the festive bells, and from&#10;every hearth, even of the smallest hut, rose the smoke into the&#10;blue sky, like the smoke from the festive thank-offerings on the&#10;Druids&#39; altars. The sea gradually became calm, and on board a great&#10;ship that had withstood the tempest during the night, all the flags&#10;were displayed, as a token of joy and festivity. &#34;The tree is down!&#10;The old oak,&#8212;our landmark on the coast!&#34; exclaimed the sailors. &#34;It&#10;must have fallen in the storm of last night. Who can replace it?&#10;Alas! no one.&#34; This was a funeral oration over the old tree; short,&#10;but well-meant. There it lay stretched on the snow-covered shore,&#10;and over it sounded the notes of a song from the ship&#8212;a song of&#10;Christmas joy, and of the redemption of the soul of man, and of&#10;eternal life through Christ&#39;s atoning blood.&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Sing aloud on the happy morn,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;All is fulfilled, for Christ is born;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;With songs of joy let us loudly sing,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#39;Hallelujahs to Christ our King.&#39;&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Thus sounded the old Christmas carol, and every one on&#10;board the ship felt his thoughts elevated, through the song and the&#10;prayer, even as the old tree had felt lifted up in its last, its&#10;beautiful dream on that Christmas morn. &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')

Everything invited to slumber, everything had a charming look&#10;of repose; and so the nurse had discovered, for she slept; and well&#10;she might sleep, while everything around her told of happiness and&#10;blessing. The guardian angel of the house leaned against the head&#10;of the bed; while over the child was spread, as it were, a net of&#10;shining stars, and each star was a pearl of happiness. All the good&#10;stars of life had brought their gifts to the newly born; here&#10;sparkled health, wealth, fortune, and love; in short, there seemed&#10;to be everything for which man could wish on earth.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Everything has been bestowed here,&#34; said the guardian&#10;angel.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No, not everything,&#34; said a voice near him&#8212;the voice of&#10;the good angel of the child; &#34;one fairy has not yet brought her&#10;gift, but she will, even if years should elapse, she will bring her&#10;gift; it is the last pearl that is wanting.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Wanting!&#34; cried the guardian angel; &#34;nothing must be&#10;wanting here; and if it is so, let us fetch it; let us seek the&#10;powerful fairy; let us go to her.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;She will come, she will come some day&#10;unsought!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Her pearl must not be missing; it must be there, that the&#10;crown, when worn, may be complete. Where is she to be found? Where&#10;does she dwell?&#34; said the guardian angel. &#34;Tell me, and I will&#10;procure the pearl.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Will you do that?&#34; replied the good angel of the child.&#10;&#34;Then I will lead you to her directly, wherever she may be. She has&#10;no abiding place; she rules in the palace of the emperor, sometimes&#10;she enters the peasant&#39;s humble cot; she passes no one without&#10;leaving a trace of her presence. She brings her gift with her,&#10;whether it is a world or a bauble. To this child she must come. You&#10;think that to wait for this time would be long and useless. Well,&#10;then, let us go for this pearl&#8212;the only one lacking amidst all this&#10;wealth.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then hand-in-hand they floated away to the spot where the&#10;fairy was now lingering. It was in a large house with dark windows&#10;and empty rooms, in which a peculiar stillness reigned. A whole row&#10;of windows stood open, so that the rude wind could enter at its&#10;pleasure, and the long white curtains waved to and fro in the&#10;current of air. In the centre of one of the rooms stood an open&#10;coffin, in which lay the body of a woman, still in the bloom of&#10;youth and very beautiful. Fresh roses were scattered over her. The&#10;delicate folded hands and the noble face glorified in death by the&#10;solemn, earnest look, which spoke of an entrance into a better&#10;world, were alone visible. Around the coffin stood the husband and&#10;children, a whole troop, the youngest in the father&#39;s arms. They&#10;were come to take a last farewell look of their mother. The husband&#10;kissed her hand, which now lay like a withered leaf, but which a&#10;short time before had been diligently employed in deeds of love for&#10;them all. Tears of sorrow rolled down their cheeks, and fell in&#10;heavy drops on the floor, but not a word was spoken. The silence&#10;which reigned here expressed a world of grief. With silent steps,&#10;still sobbing, they left the room. A burning light remained in the&#10;room, and a long, red wick rose far above the flame, which&#10;fluttered in the draught of air. Strange men came in and placed the&#10;lid of the coffin over the dead, and drove the nails firmly in;&#10;while the blows of the hammer resounded through the house, and&#10;echoed in the hearts that were bleeding.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Whither art thou leading me?&#34; asked the guardian angel.&#10;&#34;Here dwells no fairy whose pearl could be counted amongst the best&#10;gifts of life.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, she is here; here in this sacred hour,&#34; replied the&#10;angel, pointing to a corner of the room; and there,&#8212;where in her&#10;life-time, the mother had taken her seat amidst flowers and&#10;pictures: in that spot, where she, like the blessed fairy of the&#10;house, had welcomed husband, children, and friends, and, like a&#10;sunbeam, had spread joy and cheerfulness around her, the centre and&#10;heart of them all,&#8212;there, in that very spot, sat a strange woman,&#10;clothed in long, flowing garments, and occupying the place of the&#10;dead wife and mother. It was the fairy, and her name was &#34;Sorrow.&#34;&#10;A hot tear rolled into her lap, and formed itself into a pearl,&#10;glowing with all the colors of the rainbow. The angel seized it:&#10;the, pearl glittered like a star with seven-fold radiance. The&#10;pearl of Sorrow, the last, which must not be wanting, increases the&#10;lustre, and explains the meaning of all the other&#10;pearls.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Do you see the shimmer of the rainbow, which unites earth&#10;to heaven?&#34; So has there been a bridge built between this world and&#10;the next. Through the night of the grave we gaze upwards beyond the&#10;stars to the end of all things. Then we glance at the pearl of&#10;Sorrow, in which are concealed the wings which shall carry us away&#10;to eternal happiness. &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode(''), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;IN a village there once lived two men who had the same&#10;name. They were both called Claus. One of them had four horses, but&#10;the other had only one; so to distinguish them, people called the&#10;owner of the four horses, &#34;Great Claus,&#34; and he who had only one,&#10;&#34;Little Claus.&#34; Now we shall hear what happened to them, for this&#10;is a true story.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Through the whole week, Little Claus was obliged to plough&#10;for Great Claus, and lend him his one horse; and once a week, on a&#10;Sunday, Great Claus lent him all his four horses. Then how Little&#10;Claus would smack his whip over all five horses, they were as good&#10;as his own on that one day. The sun shone brightly, and the church&#10;bells were ringing merrily as the people passed by, dressed in&#10;their best clothes, with their prayer-books under their arms. They&#10;were going to hear the clergyman preach. They looked at Little&#10;Claus ploughing with his five horses, and he was so proud that he&#10;smacked his whip, and said, &#34;Gee-up, my five horses.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You must not say that,&#34; said Big Claus; &#34;for only one of&#10;them belongs to you.&#34; But Little Claus soon forgot what he ought to&#10;say, and when any one passed he would call out, &#34;Gee-up, my five&#10;horses!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Now I must beg you not to say that again,&#34; said Big&#10;Claus; &#34;for if you do, I shall hit your horse on the head, so that&#10;he will drop dead on the spot, and there will be an end of&#10;him.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I promise you I will not say it any more,&#34; said the&#10;other; but as soon as people came by, nodding to him, and wishing&#10;him &#34;Good day,&#34; he became so pleased, and thought how grand it&#10;looked to have five horses ploughing in his field, that he cried&#10;out again, &#34;Gee-up, all my horses!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I&#39;ll gee-up your horses for you,&#34; said Big Claus; and&#10;seizing a hammer, he struck the one horse of Little Claus on the&#10;head, and he fell dead instantly.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, now I have no horse at all, said Little Claus,&#10;weeping. But after a while he took off the dead horse&#39;s skin, and&#10;hung the hide to dry in the wind. Then he put the dry skin into a&#10;bag, and, placing it over his shoulder, went out into the next town&#10;to sell the horse&#39;s skin. He had a very long way to go, and had to&#10;pass through a dark, gloomy forest. Presently a storm arose, and he&#10;lost his way, and before he discovered the right path, evening came&#10;on, and it was still a long way to the town, and too far to return&#10;home before night. Near the road stood a large farmhouse. The&#10;shutters outside the windows were closed, but lights shone through&#10;the crevices at the top. &#34;I might get permission to stay here for&#10;the night,&#34; thought Little Claus; so he went up to the door and&#10;knocked. The farmer&#39;s wife opened the door; but when she heard what&#10;he wanted, she told him to go away, as her husband would not allow&#10;her to admit strangers. &#34;Then I shall be obliged to lie out here,&#34;&#10;said Little Claus to himself, as the farmer&#39;s wife shut the door in&#10;his face. Near to the farmhouse stood a large haystack, and between&#10;it and the house was a small shed, with a thatched roof. &#34;I can lie&#10;up there,&#34; said Little Claus, as he saw the roof; &#34;it will make a&#10;famous bed, but I hope the stork will not fly down and bite my&#10;legs;&#34; for on it stood a living stork, whose nest was in the roof.&#10;So Little Claus climbed to the roof of the shed, and while he&#10;turned himself to get comfortable, he discovered that the wooden&#10;shutters, which were closed, did not reach to the tops of the&#10;windows of the farmhouse, so that he could see into a room, in&#10;which a large table was laid out with wine, roast meat, and a&#10;splendid fish. The farmer&#39;s wife and the sexton were sitting at the&#10;table together; and she filled his glass, and helped him&#10;plenteously to fish, which appeared to be his favorite dish. &#34;If I&#10;could only get some, too,&#34; thought Little Claus; and then, as he&#10;stretched his neck towards the window he spied a large, beautiful&#10;pie,&#8212;indeed they had a glorious feast before them.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;At this moment he heard some one riding down the road,&#10;towards the farmhouse. It was the farmer returning home. He was a&#10;good man, but still he had a very strange prejudice,&#8212;he could not&#10;bear the sight of a sexton. If one appeared before him, he would&#10;put himself in a terrible rage. In consequence of this dislike, the&#10;sexton had gone to visit the farmer&#39;s wife during her husband&#39;s&#10;absence from home, and the good woman had placed before him the&#10;best she had in the house to eat. When she heard the farmer coming&#10;she was frightened, and begged the sexton to hide himself in a&#10;large empty chest that stood in the room. He did so, for he knew&#10;her husband could not endure the sight of a sexton. The woman then&#10;quickly put away the wine, and hid all the rest of the nice things&#10;in the oven; for if her husband had seen them he would have asked&#10;what they were brought out for.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, dear,&#34; sighed Little Claus from the top of the shed,&#10;as he saw all the good things disappear.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Is any one up there?&#34; asked the farmer, looking up and&#10;discovering Little Claus. &#34;Why are you lying up there? Come down,&#10;and come into the house with me.&#34; So Little Claus came down and&#10;told the farmer how he had lost his way and begged for a night&#39;s&#10;lodging.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;All right,&#34; said the farmer; &#34;but we must have something&#10;to eat first.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The woman received them both very kindly, laid the cloth&#10;on a large table, and placed before them a dish of porridge. The&#10;farmer was very hungry, and ate his porridge with a good appetite,&#10;but Little Claus could not help thinking of the nice roast meat,&#10;fish and pies, which he knew were in the oven. Under the table, at&#10;his feet, lay the sack containing the horse&#39;s skin, which he&#10;intended to sell at the next town. Now Little Claus did not relish&#10;the porridge at all, so he trod with his foot on the sack under the&#10;table, and the dry skin squeaked quite loud. &#34;Hush!&#34; said Little&#10;Claus to his sack, at the same time treading upon it again, till it&#10;squeaked louder than before.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Hallo! what have you got in your sack!&#34; asked the&#10;farmer.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, it is a conjuror,&#34; said Little Claus; &#34;and he says we&#10;need not eat porridge, for he has conjured the oven full of roast&#10;meat, fish, and pie.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Wonderful!&#34; cried the farmer, starting up and opening the&#10;oven door; and there lay all the nice things hidden by the farmer&#39;s&#10;wife, but which he supposed had been conjured there by the wizard&#10;under the table. The woman dared not say anything; so she placed&#10;the things before them, and they both ate of the fish, the meat,&#10;and the pastry.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then Little Claus trod again upon his sack, and it&#10;squeaked as before. &#34;What does he say now?&#34; asked the&#10;farmer.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;He says,&#34; replied Little Claus, &#34;that there are three&#10;bottles of wine for us, standing in the corner, by the&#10;oven.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;So the woman was obliged to bring out the wine also, which&#10;she had hidden, and the farmer drank it till he became quite merry.&#10;He would have liked such a conjuror as Little Claus carried in his&#10;sack. &#34;Could he conjure up the evil one?&#34; asked the farmer. &#34;I&#10;should like to see him now, while I am so merry.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, yes!&#34; replied Little Claus, &#34;my conjuror can do&#10;anything I ask him,&#8212;can you not?&#34; he asked, treading at the same&#10;time on the sack till it squeaked. &#34;Do you hear? he answers &#39;Yes,&#39;&#10;but he fears that we shall not like to look at him.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, I am not afraid. What will he be like?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Well, he is very much like a sexton.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ha!&#34; said the farmer, &#34;then he must be ugly. Do you know&#10;I cannot endure the sight of a sexton. However, that doesn&#39;t&#10;matter, I shall know who it is; so I shall not mind. Now then, I&#10;have got up my courage, but don&#39;t let him come too near&#10;me.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Stop, I must ask the conjuror,&#34; said Little Claus; so he&#10;trod on the bag, and stooped his ear down to listen.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What does he say?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;He says that you must go and open that large chest which&#10;stands in the corner, and you will see the evil one crouching down&#10;inside; but you must hold the lid firmly, that he may not slip&#10;out.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Will you come and help me hold it?&#34; said the farmer,&#10;going towards the chest in which his wife had hidden the sexton,&#10;who now lay inside, very much frightened. The farmer opened the lid&#10;a very little way, and peeped in.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh,&#34; cried he, springing backwards, &#34;I saw him, and he is&#10;exactly like our sexton. How dreadful it is!&#34; So after that he was&#10;obliged to drink again, and they sat and drank till far into the&#10;night.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You must sell your conjuror to me,&#34; said the farmer; &#34;ask&#10;as much as you like, I will pay it; indeed I would give you&#10;directly a whole bushel of gold.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No, indeed, I cannot,&#34; said Little Claus; &#34;only think how&#10;much profit I could make out of this conjuror.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But I should like to have him,&#34; said the fanner, still&#10;continuing his entreaties.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Well,&#34; said Little Claus at length, &#34;you have been so&#10;good as to give me a night&#39;s lodging, I will not refuse you; you&#10;shall have the conjuror for a bushel of money, but I will have&#10;quite full measure.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;So you shall,&#34; said the farmer; &#34;but you must take away&#10;the chest as well. I would not have it in the house another hour;&#10;there is no knowing if he may not be still there.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;So Little Claus gave the farmer the sack containing the&#10;dried horse&#39;s skin, and received in exchange a bushel of money&#8212;full&#10;measure. The farmer also gave him a wheelbarrow on which to carry&#10;away the chest and the gold.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Farewell,&#34; said Little Claus, as he went off with his&#10;money and the great chest, in which the sexton lay still concealed.&#10;On one side of the forest was a broad, deep river, the water flowed&#10;so rapidly that very few were able to swim against the stream. A&#10;new bridge had lately been built across it, and in the middle of&#10;this bridge Little Claus stopped, and said, loud enough to be heard&#10;by the sexton, &#34;Now what shall I do with this stupid chest; it is&#10;as heavy as if it were full of stones: I shall be tired if I roll&#10;it any farther, so I may as well throw it in the river; if it swims&#10;after me to my house, well and good, and if not, it will not much&#10;matter.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;So he seized the chest in his hand and lifted it up a&#10;little, as if he were going to throw it into the water.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No, leave it alone,&#34; cried the sexton from within the&#10;chest; &#34;let me out first.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh,&#34; exclaimed Little Claus, pretending to be frightened,&#10;&#34;he is in there still, is he? I must throw him into the river, that&#10;he may be drowned.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, no; oh, no,&#34; cried the sexton; &#34;I will give you a&#10;whole bushel full of money if you will let me go.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Why, that is another matter,&#34; said Little Claus, opening&#10;the chest. The sexton crept out, pushed the empty chest into the&#10;water, and went to his house, then he measured out a whole bushel&#10;full of gold for Little Claus, who had already received one from&#10;the farmer, so that now he had a barrow full.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I have been well paid for my horse,&#34; said he to himself&#10;when he reached home, entered his own room, and emptied all his&#10;money into a heap on the floor. &#34;How vexed Great Claus will be when&#10;he finds out how rich I have become all through my one horse; but I&#10;shall not tell him exactly how it all happened.&#34; Then he sent a boy&#10;to Great Claus to borrow a bushel measure.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What can he want it for?&#34; thought Great Claus; so he&#10;smeared the bottom of the measure with tar, that some of whatever&#10;was put into it might stick there and remain. And so it happened;&#10;for when the measure returned, three new silver florins were&#10;sticking to it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What does this mean?&#34; said Great Claus; so he ran off&#10;directly to Little Claus, and asked, &#34;Where did you get so much&#10;money?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, for my horse&#39;s skin, I sold it yesterday.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It was certainly well paid for then,&#34; said Great Claus;&#10;and he ran home to his house, seized a hatchet, and knocked all his&#10;four horses on the head, flayed off their skins, and took them to&#10;the town to sell. &#34;Skins, skins, who&#39;ll buy skins?&#34; he cried, as he&#10;went through the streets. All the shoemakers and tanners came&#10;running, and asked how much he wanted for them.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;A bushel of money, for each,&#34; replied Great&#10;Claus.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Are you mad?&#34; they all cried; &#34;do you think we have money&#10;to spend by the bushel?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Skins, skins,&#34; he cried again, &#34;who&#39;ll buy skins?&#34; but to&#10;all who inquired the price, his answer was, &#34;a bushel of&#10;money.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;He is making fools of us,&#34; said they all; then the&#10;shoemakers took their straps, and the tanners their leather aprons,&#10;and began to beat Great Claus.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Skins, skins!&#34; they cried, mocking him; &#34;yes, we&#39;ll mark&#10;your skin for you, till it is black and blue.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Out of the town with him,&#34; said they. And Great Claus was&#10;obliged to run as fast as he could, he had never before been so&#10;thoroughly beaten.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ah,&#34; said he, as he came to his house; &#34;Little Claus&#10;shall pay me for this; I will beat him to death.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Meanwhile the old grandmother of Little Claus died. She&#10;had been cross, unkind, and really spiteful to him; but he was very&#10;sorry, and took the dead woman and laid her in his warm bed to see&#10;if he could bring her to life again. There he determined that she&#10;should lie the whole night, while he seated himself in a chair in a&#10;corner of the room as he had often done before. During the night,&#10;as he sat there, the door opened, and in came Great Claus with a&#10;hatchet. He knew well where Little Claus&#39;s bed stood; so he went&#10;right up to it, and struck the old grandmother on the head.&#10;thinking it must be Little Claus.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;There,&#34; cried he, &#34;now you cannot make a fool of me&#10;again;&#34; and then he went home.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That is a very wicked man,&#34; thought Little Claus; &#34;he&#10;meant to kill me. It is a good thing for my old grandmother that&#10;she was already dead, or he would have taken her life.&#34; Then he&#10;dressed his old grandmother in her best clothes, borrowed a horse&#10;of his neighbor, and harnessed it to a cart. Then he placed the old&#10;woman on the back seat, so that she might not fall out as he drove,&#10;and rode away through the wood. By sunrise they reached a large&#10;inn, where Little Claus stopped and went to get something to eat.&#10;The landlord was a rich man, and a good man too; but as passionate&#10;as if he had been made of pepper and snuff.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Good morning,&#34; said he to Little Claus; &#34;you are come&#10;betimes to-day.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes,&#34; said Little Claus; &#34;I am going to the town with my&#10;old grandmother; she is sitting at the back of the wagon, but I&#10;cannot bring her into the room. Will you take her a glass of mead?&#10;but you must speak very loud, for she cannot hear well.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, certainly I will,&#34; replied the landlord; and,&#10;pouring out a glass of mead, he carried it out to the dead&#10;grandmother, who sat upright in the cart. &#34;Here is a glass of mead&#10;from your grandson,&#34; said the landlord. The dead woman did not&#10;answer a word, but sat quite still. &#34;Do you not hear?&#34; cried the&#10;landlord as loud as he could; &#34;here is a glass of mead from your&#10;grandson.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Again and again he bawled it out, but as she did not stir&#10;he flew into a passion, and threw the glass of mead in her face; it&#10;struck her on the nose, and she fell backwards out of the cart, for&#10;she was only seated there, not tied in.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Hallo!&#34; cried Little Claus, rushing out of the door, and&#10;seizing hold of the landlord by the throat; &#34;you have killed my&#10;grandmother; see, here is a great hole in her forehead.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, how unfortunate,&#34; said the landlord, wringing his&#10;hands. &#34;This all comes of my fiery temper. Dear Little Claus, I&#10;will give you a bushel of money; I will bury your grandmother as if&#10;she were my own; only keep silent, or else they will cut off my&#10;head, and that would be disagreeable.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;So it happened that Little Claus received another bushel&#10;of money, and the landlord buried his old grandmother as if she had&#10;been his own. When Little Claus reached home again, he immediately&#10;sent a boy to Great Claus, requesting him to lend him a bushel&#10;measure. &#34;How is this?&#34; thought Great Claus; &#34;did I not kill him? I&#10;must go and see for myself.&#34; So he went to Little Claus, and took&#10;the bushel measure with him. &#34;How did you get all this money?&#34;&#10;asked Great Claus, staring with wide open eyes at his neighbor&#39;s&#10;treasures.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You killed my grandmother instead of me,&#34; said Little&#10;Claus; &#34;so I have sold her for a bushel of money.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That is a good price at all events,&#34; said Great Claus. So&#10;he went home, took a hatchet, and killed his old grandmother with&#10;one blow. Then he placed her on a cart, and drove into the town to&#10;the apothecary, and asked him if he would buy a dead&#10;body.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Whose is it, and where did you get it?&#34; asked the&#10;apothecary.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It is my grandmother,&#34; he replied; &#34;I killed her with a&#10;blow, that I might get a bushel of money for her.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Heaven preserve us!&#34; cried the apothecary, &#34;you are out&#10;of your mind. Don&#39;t say such things, or you will lose your head.&#34;&#10;And then he talked to him seriously about the wicked deed he had&#10;done, and told him that such a wicked man would surely be punished.&#10;Great Claus got so frightened that he rushed out of the surgery,&#10;jumped into the cart, whipped up his horses, and drove home&#10;quickly. The apothecary and all the people thought him mad, and let&#10;him drive where he liked.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You shall pay for this,&#34; said Great Claus, as soon as he&#10;got into the highroad, &#34;that you shall, Little Claus.&#34; So as soon&#10;as he reached home he took the largest sack he could find and went&#10;over to Little Claus. &#34;You have played me another trick,&#34; said he.&#10;&#34;First, I killed all my horses, and then my old grandmother, and it&#10;is all your fault; but you shall not make a fool of me any more.&#34;&#10;So he laid hold of Little Claus round the body, and pushed him into&#10;the sack, which he took on his shoulders, saying, &#34;Now I&#39;m going to&#10;drown you in the river.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;He had a long way to go before he reached the river, and&#10;Little Claus was not a very light weight to carry. The road led by&#10;the church, and as they passed he could hear the organ playing and&#10;the people singing beautifully. Great Claus put down the sack close&#10;to the church-door, and thought he might as well go in and hear a&#10;psalm before he went any farther. Little Claus could not possibly&#10;get out of the sack, and all the people were in church; so in he&#10;went.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh dear, oh dear,&#34; sighed Little Claus in the sack, as he&#10;turned and twisted about; but he found he could not loosen the&#10;string with which it was tied. Presently an old cattle driver, with&#10;snowy hair, passed by, carrying a large staff in his hand, with&#10;which he drove a large herd of cows and oxen before him. They&#10;stumbled against the sack in which lay Little Claus, and turned it&#10;over. &#34;Oh dear,&#34; sighed Little Claus, &#34;I am very young, yet I am&#10;soon going to heaven.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And I, poor fellow,&#34; said the drover, &#34;I who am so old&#10;already, cannot get there.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Open the sack,&#34; cried Little Claus; &#34;creep into it&#10;instead of me, and you will soon be there.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;With all my heart,&#34; replied the drover, opening the sack,&#10;from which sprung Little Claus as quickly as possible. &#34;Will you&#10;take care of my cattle?&#34; said the old man, as he crept into the&#10;bag.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes,&#34; said Little Claus, and he tied up the sack, and&#10;then walked off with all the cows and oxen.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;When Great Claus came out of church, he took up the sack,&#10;and placed it on his shoulders. It appeared to have become lighter,&#10;for the old drover was not half so heavy as Little&#10;Claus.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;How light he seems now,&#34; said he. &#34;Ah, it is because I&#10;have been to a church.&#34; So he walked on to the river, which was&#10;deep and broad, and threw the sack containing the old drover into&#10;the water, believing it to be Little Claus. &#34;There you may lie!&#34; he&#10;exclaimed; &#34;you will play me no more tricks now.&#34; Then he turned to&#10;go home, but when he came to a place where two roads crossed, there&#10;was Little Claus driving the cattle. &#34;How is this?&#34; said Great&#10;Claus. &#34;Did I not drown you just now?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes,&#34; said Little Claus; &#34;you threw me into the river&#10;about half an hour ago.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But wherever did you get all these fine beasts?&#34; asked&#10;Great Claus.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;These beasts are sea-cattle,&#34; replied Little Claus. &#34;I&#39;ll&#10;tell you the whole story, and thank you for drowning me; I am above&#10;you now, I am really very rich. I was frightened, to be sure, while&#10;I lay tied up in the sack, and the wind whistled in my ears when&#10;you threw me into the river from the bridge, and I sank to the&#10;bottom immediately; but I did not hurt myself, for I fell upon&#10;beautifully soft grass which grows down there; and in a moment, the&#10;sack opened, and the sweetest little maiden came towards me. She&#10;had snow-white robes, and a wreath of green leaves on her wet hair.&#10;She took me by the hand, and said, &#39;So you are come, Little Claus,&#10;and here are some cattle for you to begin with. About a mile&#10;farther on the road, there is another herd for you.&#39; Then I saw&#10;that the river formed a great highway for the people who live in&#10;the sea. They were walking and driving here and there from the sea&#10;to the land at the, spot where the river terminates. The bed of the&#10;river was covered with the loveliest flowers and sweet fresh grass.&#10;The fish swam past me as rapidly as the birds do here in the air.&#10;How handsome all the people were, and what fine cattle were grazing&#10;on the hills and in the valleys!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But why did you come up again,&#34; said Great Claus, &#34;if it&#10;was all so beautiful down there? I should not have done&#10;so?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Well,&#34; said Little Claus, &#34;it was good policy on my part;&#10;you heard me say just now that I was told by the sea-maiden to go a&#10;mile farther on the road, and I should find a whole herd of cattle.&#10;By the road she meant the river, for she could not travel any other&#10;way; but I knew the winding of the river, and how it bends,&#10;sometimes to the right and sometimes to the left, and it seemed a&#10;long way, so I chose a shorter one; and, by coming up to the land,&#10;and then driving across the fields back again to the river, I shall&#10;save half a mile, and get all my cattle more quickly.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What a lucky fellow you are!&#34; exclaimed Great Claus. &#34;Do&#10;you think I should get any sea-cattle if I went down to the bottom&#10;of the river?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, I think so,&#34; said Little Claus; &#34;but I cannot carry&#10;you there in a sack, you are too heavy. However if you will go&#10;there first, and then creep into a sack, I will throw you in with&#10;the greatest pleasure.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Thank you,&#34; said Great Claus; &#34;but remember, if I do not&#10;get any sea-cattle down there I shall come up again and give you a&#10;good thrashing.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No, now, don&#39;t be too fierce about it!&#34; said Little&#10;Claus, as they walked on towards the river. When they approached&#10;it, the cattle, who were very thirsty, saw the stream, and ran down&#10;to drink.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;See what a hurry they are in,&#34; said Little Claus, &#34;they&#10;are longing to get down again,&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Come, help me, make haste,&#34; said Great Claus; &#34;or you&#39;ll&#10;get beaten.&#34; So he crept into a large sack, which had been lying&#10;across the back of one of the oxen.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Put in a stone,&#34; said Great Claus, &#34;or I may not&#10;sink.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, there&#39;s not much fear of that,&#34; he replied; still he&#10;put a large stone into the bag, and then tied it tightly, and gave&#10;it a push.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Plump!&#34; In went Great Claus, and immediately sank to the&#10;bottom of the river.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I&#39;m afraid he will not find any cattle,&#34; said Little&#10;Claus, and then he drove his own beasts homewards.&#10;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode(''), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;THERE was once a little boy who had caught cold; he had&#10;gone out and got wet feet. Nobody had the least idea how it had&#10;happened; the weather was quite dry. His mother undressed him, put&#10;him to bed, and ordered the teapot to be brought in, that she might&#10;make him a good cup of tea from the elder-tree blossoms, which is&#10;so warming. At the same time, the kind-hearted old man who lived by&#10;himself in the upper storey of the house came in; he led a lonely&#10;life, for he had no wife and children; but he loved the children of&#10;others very much, and he could tell so many fairy tales and&#10;stories, that it was a pleasure to hear him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Now, drink your tea,&#34; said the mother; &#34;perhaps you will&#10;hear a story.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, if I only knew a fresh one,&#34; said the old man, and&#10;nodded smilingly. &#34;But how did the little fellow get his wet feet?&#34;&#10;he then asked.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That,&#34; replied the mother, &#34;nobody can&#10;understand.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Will you tell me a story?&#34; asked the boy.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, if you can tell me as nearly as possible how deep is&#10;the gutter in the little street where you go to school.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Just half as high as my top-boots,&#34; replied the boy; &#34;but&#10;then I must stand in the deepest holes.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;There, now we know where you got your wet feet,&#34; said the&#10;old man. &#34;I ought to tell you a story, but the worst of it is, I do&#10;not know any more.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You can make one up,&#34; said the little boy. &#34;Mother says&#10;you can tell a fairy tale about anything you look at or&#10;touch.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That is all very well, but such tales or stories are&#10;worth nothing! No, the right ones come by themselves and knock at&#10;my forehead saying: &#39;Here I am.&#39;&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Will not one knock soon?&#34; asked the boy; and the mother&#10;smiled while she put elder-tree blossoms into the teapot and poured&#10;boiling water over them. &#34;Pray, tell me a story.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, if stories came by themselves; they are so proud,&#10;they only come when they please.&#8212;But wait,&#34; he said suddenly,&#10;&#34;there is one. Look at the teapot; there is a story in it&#10;now.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the little boy looked at the teapot; the lid rose up&#10;gradually, the elder-tree blossoms sprang forth one by one, fresh&#10;and white; long boughs came forth; even out of the spout they grew&#10;up in all directions, and formed a bush&#8212;nay, a large elder tree,&#10;which stretched its branches up to the bed and pushed the curtains&#10;aside; and there were so many blossoms and such a sweet fragrance!&#10;In the midst of the tree sat a kindly-looking old woman with a&#10;strange dress; it was as green as the leaves, and trimmed with&#10;large white blossoms, so that it was difficult to say whether it&#10;was real cloth, or the leaves and blossoms of the&#10;elder-tree.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What is this woman&#39;s name?&#34; asked the little&#10;boy.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Well, the Romans and Greeks used to call her a Dryad,&#34;&#10;said the old man; &#34;but we do not understand that. Out in the&#10;sailors&#39; quarter they give her a better name; there she is called&#10;elder-tree mother. Now, you must attentively listen to her and look&#10;at the beautiful elder-tree.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Just such a large tree, covered with flowers, stands out&#10;there; it grew in the corner of an humble little yard; under this&#10;tree sat two old people one afternoon in the beautiful sunshine. He&#10;was an old, old sailor, and she his old wife; they had already&#10;great-grandchildren, and were soon to celebrate their golden&#10;wedding, but they could not remember the date, and the elder-tree&#10;mother was sitting in the tree and looked as pleased as this one&#10;here. &#39;I know very well when the golden wedding is to take place,&#39;&#10;she said; but they did not hear it&#8212;they were talking of bygone&#10;days.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;Well, do you remember?&#39; said the old sailor, &#39;when we&#10;were quite small and used to run about and play&#8212;it was in the very&#10;same yard where we now are&#8212;we used to put little branches into the&#10;ground and make a garden.&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;Yes,&#39; said the old woman, &#39;I remember it very well; we&#10;used to water the branches, and one of them, an elder-tree branch,&#10;took root, and grew and became the large tree under which we are&#10;now sitting as old people.&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;Certainly, you are right,&#39; he said; &#39;and in yonder&#10;corner stood a large water-tub; there I used to sail my boat, which&#10;I had cut out myself&#8212;it sailed so well; but soon I had to sail&#10;somewhere else.&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;But first we went to school to learn something,&#39; she&#10;said, &#39;and then we were confirmed; we both wept on that day, but in&#10;the afternoon we went out hand in hand, and ascended the high round&#10;tower and looked out into the wide world right over Copenhagen and&#10;the sea; then we walked to Fredericksburg, where the king and the&#10;queen were sailing about in their magnificent boat on the&#10;canals.&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;But soon I had to sail about somewhere else, and for&#10;many years I was travelling about far away from home.&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;And I often cried about you, for I was afraid lest you&#10;were drowned and lying at the bottom of the sea. Many a time I got&#10;up in the night and looked if the weathercock had turned; it turned&#10;often, but you did not return. I remember one day distinctly: the&#10;rain was pouring down in torrents; the dust-man had come to the&#10;house where I was in service; I went down with the dust-bin and&#10;stood for a moment in the doorway, and looked at the dreadful&#10;weather. Then the postman gave me a letter; it was from you.&#10;Heavens! how that letter had travelled about. I tore it open and&#10;read it; I cried and laughed at the same time, and was so happy!&#10;Therein was written that you were staying in the hot countries,&#10;where the coffee grows. These must be marvellous countries. You&#10;said a great deal about them, and I read all while the rain was&#10;pouring down and I was standing there with the dust-bin. Then&#10;suddenly some one put his arm round my waist-&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;Yes, and you gave him a hearty smack on the cheek,&#39; said&#10;the old man.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;I did not know that it was you&#8212;you had come as quickly&#10;as your letter; and you looked so handsome, and so you do still.&#10;You had a large yellow silk handkerchief in your pocket and a&#10;shining hat on. You looked so well, and the weather in the street&#10;was horrible!&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;Then we married,&#39; he said. &#39;Do you remember how we got&#10;our first boy, and then Mary, Niels, Peter, John, and&#10;Christian?&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#39;Oh yes; and now they have all grown up, and have become&#10;useful members of society, whom everybody cares for.&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;And their children have had children again,&#39; said the&#10;old sailor. &#39;Yes, these are children&#39;s children, and they are&#10;strong and healthy. If I am not mistaken, our wedding took place at&#10;this season of the year.&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;Yes, to-day is your golden wedding-day,&#39; said the little&#10;elder-tree mother, stretching her head down between the two old&#10;people, who thought that she was their neighbour who was nodding to&#10;them; they looked at each other and clasped hands. Soon afterwards&#10;the children and grandchildren came, for they knew very well that&#10;it was the golden wedding-day; they had already wished them joy and&#10;happiness in the morning, but the old people had forgotten it,&#10;although they remembered things so well that had passed many, many&#10;years ago. The elder-tree smelt strongly, and the setting sun&#10;illuminated the faces of the two old people, so that they looked&#10;quite rosy; the youngest of the grandchildren danced round them,&#10;and cried merrily that there would be a feast in the evening, for&#10;they were to have hot potatoes; and the elder mother nodded in the&#10;tree and cried &#39;Hooray&#39; with the others.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But that was no fairy tale,&#34; said the little boy who had&#10;listened to it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You will presently understand it,&#34; said the old man who&#10;told the story. &#34;Let us ask little elder-tree mother about&#10;it.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That was no fairy tale,&#34; said the little elder-tree&#10;mother; &#34;but now it comes! Real life furnishes us with subjects for&#10;the most wonderful fairy tales; for otherwise my beautiful&#10;elder-bush could not have grown forth out of the&#10;teapot.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And then she took the little boy out of bed and placed him&#10;on her bosom; the elder branches, full of blossoms, closed over&#10;them; it was as if they sat in a thick leafy bower which flew with&#10;them through the air; it was beautiful beyond all description. The&#10;little elder-tree mother had suddenly become a charming young girl,&#10;but her dress was still of the same green material, covered with&#10;white blossoms, as the elder-tree mother had worn; she had a real&#10;elder blossom on her bosom, and a wreath of the same flowers was&#10;wound round her curly golden hair; her eyes were so large and so&#10;blue that it was wonderful to look at them. She and the boy kissed&#10;each other, and then they were of the same age and felt the same&#10;joys. They walked hand in hand out of the bower, and now stood at&#10;home in a beautiful flower garden. Near the green lawn the father&#39;s&#10;walking-stick was tied to a post. There was life in this stick for&#10;the little ones, for as soon as they seated themselves upon it the&#10;polished knob turned into a neighing horse&#39;s head, a long black&#10;mane was fluttering in the wind, and four strong slender legs grew&#10;out. The animal was fiery and spirited; they galloped round the&#10;lawn. &#34;Hooray! now we shall ride far away, many miles!&#34; said the&#10;boy; &#34;we shall ride to the nobleman&#39;s estate where we were last&#10;year.&#34; And they rode round the lawn again, and the little girl,&#10;who, as we know, was no other than the little elder-tree mother,&#10;continually cried, &#34;Now we are in the country! Do you see the&#10;farmhouse there, with the large baking stove, which projects like a&#10;gigantic egg out of the wall into the road? The elder-tree spreads&#10;its branches over it, and the cock struts about and scratches for&#10;the hens. Look how proud he is! Now we are near the church; it&#10;stands on a high hill, under the spreading oak trees; one of them&#10;is half dead! Now we are at the smithy, where the fire roars and&#10;the half-naked men beat with their hammers so that the sparks fly&#10;far and wide. Let&#39;s be off to the beautiful farm!&#34; And they passed&#10;by everything the little girl, who was sitting behind on the stick,&#10;described, and the boy saw it, and yet they only went round the&#10;lawn. Then they played in a side-walk, and marked out a little&#10;garden on the ground; she took elder-blossoms out of her hair and&#10;planted them, and they grew exactly like those the old people&#10;planted when they were children, as we have heard before. They&#10;walked about hand in hand, just as the old couple had done when&#10;they were little, but they did not go to the round tower nor to the&#10;Fredericksburg garden. No; the little girl seized the boy round the&#10;waist, and then they flew far into the country. It was spring and&#10;it became summer, it was autumn and it became winter, and thousands&#10;of pictures reflected themselves in the boy&#39;s eyes and heart, and&#10;the little girl always sang again, &#34;You will never forget that!&#34;&#10;And during their whole flight the elder-tree smelt so sweetly; he&#10;noticed the roses and the fresh beeches, but the elder-tree smelt&#10;much stronger, for the flowers were fixed on the little girl&#39;s&#10;bosom, against which the boy often rested his head during the&#10;flight.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It is beautiful here in spring,&#34; said the little girl,&#10;and they were again in the green beechwood, where the thyme&#10;breathed forth sweet fragrance at their feet, and the pink anemones&#10;looked lovely in the green moss. &#34;Oh! that it were always spring in&#10;the fragrant beechwood!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Here it is splendid in summer!&#34; she said, and they passed&#10;by old castles of the age of chivalry. The high walls and indented&#10;battlements were reflected in the water of the ditches, on which&#10;swans were swimming and peering into the old shady avenues. The&#10;corn waved in the field like a yellow sea. Red and yellow flowers&#10;grew in the ditches, wild hops and convolvuli in full bloom in the&#10;hedges. In the evening the moon rose, large and round, and the&#10;hayricks in the meadows smelt sweetly. &#34;One can never forget&#10;it!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Here it is beautiful in autumn!&#34; said the little girl,&#10;and the atmosphere seemed twice as high and blue, while the wood&#10;shone with crimson, green, and gold. The hounds were running off,&#10;flocks of wild fowl flew screaming over the barrows, while the&#10;bramble bushes twined round the old stones. The dark-blue sea was&#10;covered with white-sailed ships, and in the barns sat old women,&#10;girls, and children picking hops into a large tub; the young ones&#10;sang songs, and the old people told fairy tales about goblins and&#10;sorcerers. It could not be more pleasant anywhere.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Here it&#39;s agreeable in winter!&#34; said the little girl, and&#10;all the trees were covered with hoar-frost, so that they looked&#10;like white coral. The snow creaked under one&#39;s feet, as if one had&#10;new boots on. One shooting star after another traversed the sky. In&#10;the room the Christmas tree was lit, and there were song and&#10;merriment. In the peasant&#39;s cottage the violin sounded, and games&#10;were played for apple quarters; even the poorest child said, &#34;It is&#10;beautiful in winter!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And indeed it was beautiful! And the little girl showed&#10;everything to the boy, and the elder-tree continued to breathe&#10;forth sweet perfume, while the red flag with the white cross was&#10;streaming in the wind; it was the flag under which the old sailor&#10;had served. The boy became a youth; he was to go out into the wide&#10;world, far away to the countries where the coffee grows. But at&#10;parting the little girl took an elder-blossom from her breast and&#10;gave it to him as a keepsake. He placed it in his prayer-book, and&#10;when he opened it in distant lands it was always at the place where&#10;the flower of remembrance was lying; and the more he looked at it&#10;the fresher it became, so that he could almost smell the fragrance&#10;of the woods at home. He distinctly saw the little girl, with her&#10;bright blue eyes, peeping out from behind the petals, and heard her&#10;whispering, &#34;Here it is beautiful in spring, in summer, in autumn,&#10;and in winter,&#34; and hundreds of pictures passed through his&#10;mind.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Thus many years rolled by. He had now become an old man,&#10;and was sitting, with his old wife, under an elder-tree in full&#10;bloom. They held each other by the hand exactly as the&#10;great-grandfather and the great-grandmother had done outside, and,&#10;like them, they talked about bygone days and of their golden&#10;wedding. The little girl with the blue eyes and elder-blossoms in&#10;her hair was sitting high up in the tree, and nodded to them,&#10;saying, &#34;To-day is the golden wedding!&#34; And then she took two&#10;flowers out of her wreath and kissed them. They glittered at first&#10;like silver, then like gold, and when she placed them on the heads&#10;of the old people each flower became a golden crown. There they&#10;both sat like a king and queen under the sweet-smelling tree, which&#10;looked exactly like an elder-tree, and he told his wife the story&#10;of the elder-tree mother as it had been told him when he was a&#10;little boy. They were both of opinion that the story contained many&#10;points like their own, and these similarities they liked&#10;best.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, so it is,&#34; said the little girl in the tree. &#34;Some&#10;call me Little Elder-tree Mother; others a Dryad; but my real name&#10;is &#39;Remembrance.&#39; It is I who sit in the tree which grows and&#10;grows. I can remember things and tell stories! But let&#39;s see if you&#10;have still got your flower.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the old man opened his prayer-book; the elder-blossom&#10;was still in it, and as fresh as if it had only just been put in.&#10;Remembrance nodded, and the two old people, with the golden crowns&#10;on their heads, sat in the glowing evening sun. They closed their&#10;eyes and&#8212;and&#8212;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Well, now the story is ended! The little boy in bed did&#10;not know whether he had dreamt it or heard it told; the teapot&#10;stood on the table, but no elder-tree was growing out of it, and&#10;the old man who had told the story was on the point of leaving the&#10;room, and he did go out.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;How beautiful it was!&#34; said the little boy. &#34;Mother, I&#10;have been to warm countries!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I believe you,&#34; said the mother; &#34;if one takes two cups&#10;of hot elder-tea it is quite natural that one gets into warm&#10;countries!&#34; And she covered him up well, so that he might not take&#10;cold. &#34;You have slept soundly while I was arguing with the old man&#10;whether it was a story or a fairy tale!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And what has become of the little elder-tree mother?&#34;&#10;asked the boy.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;She is in the teapot,&#34; said the mother; &#34;and there she&#10;may remain.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode(''), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;My poor flowers are quite dead,&#34; said little Ida, &#34;they&#10;were so pretty yesterday evening, and now all the leaves are&#10;hanging down quite withered. What do they do that for,&#34; she asked,&#10;of the student who sat on the sofa; she liked him very much, he&#10;could tell the most amusing stories, and cut out the prettiest&#10;pictures; hearts, and ladies dancing, castles with doors that&#10;opened, as well as flowers; he was a delightful student. &#34;Why do&#10;the flowers look so faded to-day?&#34; she asked again, and pointed to&#10;her nosegay, which was quite withered.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Don&#39;t you know what is the matter with them?&#34; said the&#10;student. &#34;The flowers were at a ball last night, and therefore, it&#10;is no wonder they hang their heads.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But flowers cannot dance?&#34; cried little Ida.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes indeed, they can,&#34; replied the student. &#34;When it&#10;grows dark, and everybody is asleep, they jump about quite merrily.&#10;They have a ball almost every night.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Can children go to these balls?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes,&#34; said the student, &#34;little daisies and lilies of the&#10;valley.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Where do the beautiful flowers dance?&#34; asked little&#10;Ida.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Have you not often seen the large castle outside the&#10;gates of the town, where the king lives in summer, and where the&#10;beautiful garden is full of flowers? And have you not fed the swans&#10;with bread when they swam towards you? Well, the flowers have&#10;capital balls there, believe me.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I was in the garden out there yesterday with my mother,&#34;&#10;said Ida, &#34;but all the leaves were off the trees, and there was not&#10;a single flower left. Where are they? I used to see so many in the&#10;summer.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;They are in the castle,&#34; replied the student. &#34;You must&#10;know that as soon as the king and all the court are gone into the&#10;town, the flowers run out of the garden into the castle, and you&#10;should see how merry they are. The two most beautiful roses seat&#10;themselves on the throne, and are called the king and queen, then&#10;all the red cockscombs range themselves on each side, and bow,&#10;these are the lords-in-waiting. After that the pretty flowers come&#10;in, and there is a grand ball. The blue violets represent little&#10;naval cadets, and dance with hyacinths and crocuses which they call&#10;young ladies. The tulips and tiger-lilies are the old ladies who&#10;sit and watch the dancing, so that everything may be conducted with&#10;order and propriety.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But,&#34; said little Ida, &#34;is there no one there to hurt the&#10;flowers for dancing in the king&#39;s castle?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No one knows anything about it,&#34; said the student. &#34;The&#10;old steward of the castle, who has to watch there at night,&#10;sometimes comes in; but he carries a great bunch of keys, and as&#10;soon as the flowers hear the keys rattle, they run and hide&#10;themselves behind the long curtains, and stand quite still, just&#10;peeping their heads out. Then the old steward says, &#39;I smell&#10;flowers here,&#39; but he cannot see them.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh how capital,&#34; said little Ida, clapping her hands.&#10;&#34;Should I be able to see these flowers?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes,&#34; said the student, &#34;mind you think of it the next&#10;time you go out, no doubt you will see them, if you peep through&#10;the window. I did so to-day, and I saw a long yellow lily lying&#10;stretched out on the sofa. She was a court lady.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Can the flowers from the Botanical Gardens go to these&#10;balls?&#34; asked Ida. &#34;It is such a distance!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh yes,&#34; said the student &#39;whenever they like, for they&#10;can fly. Have you not seen those beautiful red, white. and yellow&#10;butterflies, that look like flowers? They were flowers once. They&#10;have flown off their stalks into the air, and flap their leaves as&#10;if they were little wings to make them fly. Then, if they behave&#10;well, they obtain permission to fly about during the day, instead&#10;of being obliged to sit still on their stems at home, and so in&#10;time their leaves become real wings. It may be, however, that the&#10;flowers in the Botanical Gardens have never been to the king&#39;s&#10;palace, and, therefore, they know nothing of the merry doings at&#10;night, which take place there. I will tell you what to do, and the&#10;botanical professor, who lives close by here, will be so surprised.&#10;You know him very well, do you not? Well, next time you go into his&#10;garden, you must tell one of the flowers that there is going to be&#10;a grand ball at the castle, then that flower will tell all the&#10;others, and they will fly away to the castle as soon as possible.&#10;And when the professor walks into his garden, there will not be a&#10;single flower left. How he will wonder what has become of&#10;them!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But how can one flower tell another? Flowers cannot&#10;speak?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No, certainly not,&#34; replied the student; &#34;but they can&#10;make signs. Have you not often seen that when the wind blows they&#10;nod at one another, and rustle all their green leaves?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Can the professor understand the signs?&#34; asked&#10;Ida.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, to be sure he can. He went one morning into his&#10;garden, and saw a stinging nettle making signs with its leaves to a&#10;beautiful red carnation. It was saying, &#39;You are so pretty, I like&#10;you very much.&#39; But the professor did not approve of such nonsense,&#10;so he clapped his hands on the nettle to stop it. Then the leaves,&#10;which are its fingers, stung him so sharply that he has never&#10;ventured to touch a nettle since.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh how funny!&#34; said Ida, and she laughed.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;How can anyone put such notions into a child&#39;s head?&#34;&#10;said a tiresome lawyer, who had come to pay a visit, and sat on the&#10;sofa. He did not like the student, and would grumble when he saw&#10;him cutting out droll or amusing pictures. Sometimes it would be a&#10;man hanging on a gibbet and holding a heart in his hand as if he&#10;had been stealing hearts. Sometimes it was an old witch riding&#10;through the air on a broom and carrying her husband on her nose.&#10;But the lawyer did not like such jokes, and he would say as he had&#10;just said, &#34;How can anyone put such nonsense into a child&#39;s head!&#10;what absurd fancies there are!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But to little Ida, all these stories which the student&#10;told her about the flowers, seemed very droll, and she thought over&#10;them a great deal. The flowers did hang their heads, because they&#10;had been dancing all night, and were very tired, and most likely&#10;they were ill. Then she took them into the room where a number of&#10;toys lay on a pretty little table, and the whole of the table&#10;drawer besides was full of beautiful things. Her doll Sophy lay in&#10;the doll&#39;s bed asleep, and little Ida said to her, &#34;You must really&#10;get up Sophy, and be content to lie in the drawer to-night; the&#10;poor flowers are ill, and they must lie in your bed, then perhaps&#10;they will get well again.&#34; So she took the doll out, who looked&#10;quite cross, and said not a single word, for she was angry at being&#10;turned out of her bed. Ida placed the flowers in the doll&#39;s bed,&#10;and drew the quilt over them. Then she told them to lie quite still&#10;and be good, while she made some tea for them, so that they might&#10;be quite well and able to get up the next morning. And she drew the&#10;curtains close round the little bed, so that the sun might not&#10;shine in their eyes. During the whole evening she could not help&#10;thinking of what the student had told her. And before she went to&#10;bed herself, she was obliged to peep behind the curtains into the&#10;garden where all her mother&#39;s beautiful flowers grew, hyacinths and&#10;tulips, and many others. Then she whispered to them quite softly,&#10;&#34;I know you are going to a ball to-night.&#34; But the flowers appeared&#10;as if they did not understand, and not a leaf moved; still Ida felt&#10;quite sure she knew all about it. She lay awake a long time after&#10;she was in bed, thinking how pretty it must be to see all the&#10;beautiful flowers dancing in the king&#39;s garden. &#34;I wonder if my&#10;flowers have really been there,&#34; she said to herself, and then she&#10;fell asleep. In the night she awoke; she had been dreaming of the&#10;flowers and of the student, as well as of the tiresome lawyer who&#10;found fault with him. It was quite still in Ida&#39;s bedroom; the&#10;night-lamp burnt on the table, and her father and mother were&#10;asleep. &#34;I wonder if my flowers are still lying in Sophy&#39;s bed,&#34;&#10;she thought to herself; &#34;how much I should like to know.&#34; She&#10;raised herself a little, and glanced at the door of the room where&#10;all her flowers and playthings lay; it was partly open, and as she&#10;listened, it seemed as if some one in the room was playing the&#10;piano, but softly and more prettily than she had ever before heard&#10;it. &#34;Now all the flowers are certainly dancing in there,&#34; she&#10;thought, &#34;oh how much I should like to see them,&#34; but she did not&#10;dare move for fear of disturbing her father and mother. &#34;If they&#10;would only come in here,&#34; she thought; but they did not come, and&#10;the music continued to play so beautifully, and was so pretty, that&#10;she could resist no longer. She crept out of her little bed, went&#10;softly to the door and looked into the room. Oh what a splendid&#10;sight there was to be sure! There was no night-lamp burning, but&#10;the room appeared quite light, for the moon shone through the&#10;window upon the floor, and made it almost like day. All the&#10;hyacinths and tulips stood in two long rows down the room, not a&#10;single flower remained in the window, and the flower-pots were all&#10;empty. The flowers were dancing gracefully on the floor, making&#10;turns and holding each other by their long green leaves as they&#10;swung round. At the piano sat a large yellow lily which little Ida&#10;was sure she had seen in the summer, for she remembered the student&#10;saying she was very much like Miss Lina, one of Ida&#39;s friends. They&#10;all laughed at him then, but now it seemed to little Ida as if the&#10;tall, yellow flower was really like the young lady. She had just&#10;the same manners while playing, bending her long yellow face from&#10;side to side, and nodding in time to the beautiful music. Then she&#10;saw a large purple crocus jump into the middle of the table where&#10;the playthings stood, go up to the doll&#39;s bedstead and draw back&#10;the curtains; there lay the sick flowers, but they got up directly,&#10;and nodded to the others as a sign that they wished to dance with&#10;them. The old rough doll, with the broken mouth, stood up and bowed&#10;to the pretty flowers. They did not look ill at all now, but jumped&#10;about and were very merry, yet none of them noticed little Ida.&#10;Presently it seemed as if something fell from the table. Ida looked&#10;that way, and saw a slight carnival rod jumping down among the&#10;flowers as if it belonged to them; it was, however, very smooth and&#10;neat, and a little wax doll with a broad brimmed hat on her head,&#10;like the one worn by the lawyer, sat upon it. The carnival rod&#10;hopped about among the flowers on its three red stilted feet, and&#10;stamped quite loud when it danced the Mazurka; the flowers could&#10;not perform this dance, they were too light to stamp in that&#10;manner. All at once the wax doll which rode on the carnival rod&#10;seemed to grow larger and taller, and it turned round and said to&#10;the paper flowers, &#34;How can you put such things in a child&#39;s head?&#10;they are all foolish fancies;&#34; and then the doll was exactly like&#10;the lawyer with the broad brimmed hat, and looked as yellow and as&#10;cross as he did; but the paper dolls struck him on his thin legs,&#10;and he shrunk up again and became quite a little wax doll. This was&#10;very amusing, and Ida could not help laughing. The carnival rod&#10;went on dancing, and the lawyer was obliged to dance also. It was&#10;no use, he might make himself great and tall, or remain a little&#10;wax doll with a large black hat; still he must dance. Then at last&#10;the other flowers interceded for him, especially those who had lain&#10;in the doll&#39;s bed, and the carnival rod gave up his dancing. At the&#10;same moment a loud knocking was heard in the drawer, where Ida&#39;s&#10;doll Sophy lay with many other toys. Then the rough doll ran to the&#10;end of the table, laid himself flat down upon it, and began to pull&#10;the drawer out a little way.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then Sophy raised himself, and looked round quite&#10;astonished, &#34;There must be a ball here to-night,&#34; said Sophy. &#34;Why&#10;did not somebody tell me?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Will you dance with me?&#34; said the rough doll.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You are the right sort to dance with, certainly,&#34; said&#10;she, turning her back upon him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then she seated herself on the edge of the drawer, and&#10;thought that perhaps one of the flowers would ask her to dance; but&#10;none of them came. Then she coughed, &#34;Hem, hem, a-hem;&#34; but for all&#10;that not one came. The shabby doll now danced quite alone, and not&#10;very badly, after all. As none of the flowers seemed to notice&#10;Sophy, she let herself down from the drawer to the floor, so as to&#10;make a very great noise. All the flowers came round her directly,&#10;and asked if she had hurt herself, especially those who had lain in&#10;her bed. But she was not hurt at all, and Ida&#39;s flowers thanked her&#10;for the use of the nice bed, and were very kind to her. They led&#10;her into the middle of the room, where the moon shone, and danced&#10;with her, while all the other flowers formed a circle round them.&#10;Then Sophy was very happy, and said they might keep her bed; she&#10;did not mind lying in the drawer at all. But the flowers thanked&#10;her very much, and said,&#8212;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;We cannot live long. To-morrow morning we shall be quite&#10;dead; and you must tell little Ida to bury us in the garden, near&#10;to the grave of the canary; then, in the summer we shall wake up&#10;and be more beautiful than ever.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No, you must not die,&#34; said Sophy, as she kissed the&#10;flowers.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the door of the room opened, and a number of&#10;beautiful flowers danced in. Ida could not imagine where they could&#10;come from, unless they were the flowers from the king&#39;s garden.&#10;First came two lovely roses, with little golden crowns on their&#10;heads; these were the king and queen. Beautiful stocks and&#10;carnations followed, bowing to every one present. They had also&#10;music with them. Large poppies and peonies had pea-shells for&#10;instruments, and blew into them till they were quite red in the&#10;face. The bunches of blue hyacinths and the little white snowdrops&#10;jingled their bell-like flowers, as if they were real bells. Then&#10;came many more flowers: blue violets, purple heart&#39;s-ease, daisies,&#10;and lilies of the valley, and they all danced together, and kissed&#10;each other. It was very beautiful to behold.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;At last the flowers wished each other good-night. Then&#10;little Ida crept back into her bed again, and dreamt of all she had&#10;seen. When she arose the next morning, she went quickly to the&#10;little table, to see if the flowers were still there. She drew&#10;aside the curtains of the little bed. There they all lay, but quite&#10;faded; much more so than the day before. Sophy was lying in the&#10;drawer where Ida had placed her; but she looked very&#10;sleepy.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Do you remember what the flowers told you to say to me?&#34;&#10;said little Ida. But Sophy looked quite stupid, and said not a&#10;single word.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You are not kind at all,&#34; said Ida; &#34;and yet they all&#10;danced with you.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then she took a little paper box, on which were painted&#10;beautiful birds, and laid the dead flowers in it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;This shall be your pretty coffin,&#34; she said; &#34;and by and&#10;by, when my cousins come to visit me, they shall help me to bury&#10;you out in the garden; so that next summer you may grow up again&#10;more beautiful than ever.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Her cousins were two good-tempered boys, whose names were&#10;James and Adolphus. Their father had given them each a bow and&#10;arrow, and they had brought them to show Ida. She told them about&#10;the poor flowers which were dead; and as soon as they obtained&#10;permission, they went with her to bury them. The two boys walked&#10;first, with their crossbows on their shoulders, and little Ida&#10;followed, carrying the pretty box containing the dead flowers. They&#10;dug a little grave in the garden. Ida kissed her flowers and then&#10;laid them, with the box, in the earth. James and Adolphus then&#10;fired their crossbows over the grave, as they had neither guns nor&#10;cannons. &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode(''), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;IT was terribly cold and nearly dark on the last evening&#10;of the old year, and the snow was falling fast. In the cold and the&#10;darkness, a poor little girl, with bare head and naked feet, roamed&#10;through the streets. It is true she had on a pair of slippers when&#10;she left home, but they were not of much use. They were very large,&#10;so large, indeed, that they had belonged to her mother, and the&#10;poor little creature had lost them in running across the street to&#10;avoid two carriages that were rolling along at a terrible rate. One&#10;of the slippers she could not find, and a boy seized upon the other&#10;and ran away with it, saying that he could use it as a cradle, when&#10;he had children of his own. So the little girl went on with her&#10;little naked feet, which were quite red and blue with the cold. In&#10;an old apron she carried a number of matches, and had a bundle of&#10;them in her hands. No one had bought anything of her the whole day,&#10;nor had any one given here even a penny. Shivering with cold and&#10;hunger, she crept along; poor little child, she looked the picture&#10;of misery. The snowflakes fell on her long, fair hair, which hung&#10;in curls on her shoulders, but she regarded them not.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Lights were shining from every window, and there was a&#10;savory smell of roast goose, for it was New-year&#39;s eve&#8212;yes, she&#10;remembered that. In a corner, between two houses, one of which&#10;projected beyond the other, she sank down and huddled herself&#10;together. She had drawn her little feet under her, but she could&#10;not keep off the cold; and she dared not go home, for she had sold&#10;no matches, and could not take home even a penny of money. Her&#10;father would certainly beat her; besides, it was almost as cold at&#10;home as here, for they had only the roof to cover them, through&#10;which the wind howled, although the largest holes had been stopped&#10;up with straw and rags. Her little hands were almost frozen with&#10;the cold. Ah! perhaps a burning match might be some good, if she&#10;could draw it from the bundle and strike it against the wall, just&#10;to warm her fingers. She drew one out-&#34;scratch!&#34; how it sputtered&#10;as it burnt! It gave a warm, bright light, like a little candle, as&#10;she held her hand over it. It was really a wonderful light. It&#10;seemed to the little girl that she was sitting by a large iron&#10;stove, with polished brass feet and a brass ornament. How the fire&#10;burned! and seemed so beautifully warm that the child stretched out&#10;her feet as if to warm them, when, lo! the flame of the match went&#10;out, the stove vanished, and she had only the remains of the&#10;half-burnt match in her hand.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;She rubbed another match on the wall. It burst into a&#10;flame, and where its light fell upon the wall it became as&#10;transparent as a veil, and she could see into the room. The table&#10;was covered with a snowy white table-cloth, on which stood a&#10;splendid dinner service, and a steaming roast goose, stuffed with&#10;apples and dried plums. And what was still more wonderful, the&#10;goose jumped down from the dish and waddled across the floor, with&#10;a knife and fork in its breast, to the little girl. Then the match&#10;went out, and there remained nothing but the thick, damp, cold wall&#10;before her.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;She lighted another match, and then she found herself&#10;sitting under a beautiful Christmas-tree. It was larger and more&#10;beautifully decorated than the one which she had seen through the&#10;glass door at the rich merchant&#39;s. Thousands of tapers were burning&#10;upon the green branches, and colored pictures, like those she had&#10;seen in the show-windows, looked down upon it all. The little one&#10;stretched out her hand towards them, and the match went&#10;out.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Christmas lights rose higher and higher, till they&#10;looked to her like the stars in the sky. Then she saw a star fall,&#10;leaving behind it a bright streak of fire. &#34;Some one is dying,&#34;&#10;thought the little girl, for her old grandmother, the only one who&#10;had ever loved her, and who was now dead, had told her that when a&#10;star falls, a soul was going up to God.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;She again rubbed a match on the wall, and the light shone&#10;round her; in the brightness stood her old grandmother, clear and&#10;shining, yet mild and loving in her appearance. &#34;Grandmother,&#34;&#10;cried the little one, &#34;O take me with you; I know you will go away&#10;when the match burns out; you will vanish like the warm stove, the&#10;roast goose, and the large, glorious Christmas-tree.&#34; And she made&#10;haste to light the whole bundle of matches, for she wished to keep&#10;her grandmother there. And the matches glowed with a light that was&#10;brighter than the noon-day, and her grandmother had never appeared&#10;so large or so beautiful. She took the little girl in her arms, and&#10;they both flew upwards in brightness and joy far above the earth,&#10;where there was neither cold nor hunger nor pain, for they were&#10;with God.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the dawn of morning there lay the poor little one, with&#10;pale cheeks and smiling mouth, leaning against the wall; she had&#10;been frozen to death on the last evening of the year; and the&#10;New-year&#39;s sun rose and shone upon a little corpse! The child still&#10;sat, in the stiffness of death, holding the matches in her hand,&#10;one bundle of which was burnt. &#34;She tried to warm herself,&#34; said&#10;some. No one imagined what beautiful things she had seen, nor into&#10;what glory she had entered with her grandmother, on New-year&#39;s day.&#10;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode(''), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;FAR out in the ocean, where the water is as blue as the&#10;prettiest cornflower, and as clear as crystal, it is very, very&#10;deep; so deep, indeed, that no cable could fathom it: many church&#10;steeples, piled one upon another, would not reach from the ground&#10;beneath to the surface of the water above. There dwell the Sea King&#10;and his subjects. We must not imagine that there is nothing at the&#10;bottom of the sea but bare yellow sand. No, indeed; the most&#10;singular flowers and plants grow there; the leaves and stems of&#10;which are so pliant, that the slightest agitation of the water&#10;causes them to stir as if they had life. Fishes, both large and&#10;small, glide between the branches, as birds fly among the trees&#10;here upon land. In the deepest spot of all, stands the castle of&#10;the Sea King. Its walls are built of coral, and the long, gothic&#10;windows are of the clearest amber. The roof is formed of shells,&#10;that open and close as the water flows over them. Their appearance&#10;is very beautiful, for in each lies a glittering pearl, which would&#10;be fit for the diadem of a queen.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Sea King had been a widower for many years, and his&#10;aged mother kept house for him. She was a very wise woman, and&#10;exceedingly proud of her high birth; on that account she wore&#10;twelve oysters on her tail; while others, also of high rank, were&#10;only allowed to wear six. She was, however, deserving of very great&#10;praise, especially for her care of the little sea-princesses, her&#10;grand-daughters. They were six beautiful children; but the youngest&#10;was the prettiest of them all; her skin was as clear and delicate&#10;as a rose-leaf, and her eyes as blue as the deepest sea; but, like&#10;all the others, she had no feet, and her body ended in a fish&#39;s&#10;tail. All day long they played in the great halls of the castle, or&#10;among the living flowers that grew out of the walls. The large&#10;amber windows were open, and the fish swam in, just as the swallows&#10;fly into our houses when we open the windows, excepting that the&#10;fishes swam up to the princesses, ate out of their hands, and&#10;allowed themselves to be stroked. Outside the castle there was a&#10;beautiful garden, in which grew bright red and dark blue flowers,&#10;and blossoms like flames of fire; the fruit glittered like gold,&#10;and the leaves and stems waved to and fro continually. The earth&#10;itself was the finest sand, but blue as the flame of burning&#10;sulphur. Over everything lay a peculiar blue radiance, as if it&#10;were surrounded by the air from above, through which the blue sky&#10;shone, instead of the dark depths of the sea. In calm weather the&#10;sun could be seen, looking like a purple flower, with the light&#10;streaming from the calyx. Each of the young princesses had a little&#10;plot of ground in the garden, where she might dig and plant as she&#10;pleased. One arranged her flower-bed into the form of a whale;&#10;another thought it better to make hers like the figure of a little&#10;mermaid; but that of the youngest was round like the sun, and&#10;contained flowers as red as his rays at sunset. She was a strange&#10;child, quiet and thoughtful; and while her sisters would be&#10;delighted with the wonderful things which they obtained from the&#10;wrecks of vessels, she cared for nothing but her pretty red&#10;flowers, like the sun, excepting a beautiful marble statue. It was&#10;the representation of a handsome boy, carved out of pure white&#10;stone, which had fallen to the bottom of the sea from a wreck. She&#10;planted by the statue a rose-colored weeping willow. It grew&#10;splendidly, and very soon hung its fresh branches over the statue,&#10;almost down to the blue sands. The shadow had a violet tint, and&#10;waved to and fro like the branches; it seemed as if the crown of&#10;the tree and the root were at play, and trying to kiss each other.&#10;Nothing gave her so much pleasure as to hear about the world above&#10;the sea. She made her old grandmother tell her all she knew of the&#10;ships and of the towns, the people and the animals. To her it&#10;seemed most wonderful and beautiful to hear that the flowers of the&#10;land should have fragrance, and not those below the sea; that the&#10;trees of the forest should be green; and that the fishes among the&#10;trees could sing so sweetly, that it was quite a pleasure to hear&#10;them. Her grandmother called the little birds fishes, or she would&#10;not have understood her; for she had never seen birds.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;When you have reached your fifteenth year,&#34; said the&#10;grand-mother, &#34;you will have permission to rise up out of the sea,&#10;to sit on the rocks in the moonlight, while the great ships are&#10;sailing by; and then you will see both forests and&#10;towns.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the following year, one of the sisters would be&#10;fifteen: but as each was a year younger than the other, the&#10;youngest would have to wait five years before her turn came to rise&#10;up from the bottom of the ocean, and see the earth as we do.&#10;However, each promised to tell the others what she saw on her first&#10;visit, and what she thought the most beautiful; for their&#10;grandmother could not tell them enough; there were so many things&#10;on which they wanted information. None of them longed so much for&#10;her turn to come as the youngest, she who had the longest time to&#10;wait, and who was so quiet and thoughtful. Many nights she stood by&#10;the open window, looking up through the dark blue water, and&#10;watching the fish as they splashed about with their fins and tails.&#10;She could see the moon and stars shining faintly; but through the&#10;water they looked larger than they do to our eyes. When something&#10;like a black cloud passed between her and them, she knew that it&#10;was either a whale swimming over her head, or a ship full of human&#10;beings, who never imagined that a pretty little mermaid was&#10;standing beneath them, holding out her white hands towards the keel&#10;of their ship.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;As soon as the eldest was fifteen, she was allowed to rise&#10;to the surface of the ocean. When she came back, she had hundreds&#10;of things to talk about; but the most beautiful, she said, was to&#10;lie in the moonlight, on a sandbank, in the quiet sea, near the&#10;coast, and to gaze on a large town nearby, where the lights were&#10;twinkling like hundreds of stars; to listen to the sounds of the&#10;music, the noise of carriages, and the voices of human beings, and&#10;then to hear the merry bells peal out from the church steeples; and&#10;because she could not go near to all those wonderful things, she&#10;longed for them more than ever. Oh, did not the youngest sister&#10;listen eagerly to all these descriptions? and afterwards, when she&#10;stood at the open window looking up through the dark blue water,&#10;she thought of the great city, with all its bustle and noise, and&#10;even fancied she could hear the sound of the church bells, down in&#10;the depths of the sea.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In another year the second sister received permission to&#10;rise to the surface of the water, and to swim about where she&#10;pleased. She rose just as the sun was setting, and this, she said,&#10;was the most beautiful sight of all. The whole sky looked like&#10;gold, while violet and rose-colored clouds, which she could not&#10;describe, floated over her; and, still more rapidly than the&#10;clouds, flew a large flock of wild swans towards the setting sun,&#10;looking like a long white veil across the sea. She also swam&#10;towards the sun; but it sunk into the waves, and the rosy tints&#10;faded from the clouds and from the sea.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The third sister&#39;s turn followed; she was the boldest of&#10;them all, and she swam up a broad river that emptied itself into&#10;the sea. On the banks she saw green hills covered with beautiful&#10;vines; palaces and castles peeped out from amid the proud trees of&#10;the forest; she heard the birds singing, and the rays of the sun&#10;were so powerful that she was obliged often to dive down under the&#10;water to cool her burning face. In a narrow creek she found a whole&#10;troop of little human children, quite naked, and sporting about in&#10;the water; she wanted to play with them, but they fled in a great&#10;fright; and then a little black animal came to the water; it was a&#10;dog, but she did not know that, for she had never before seen one.&#10;This animal barked at her so terribly that she became frightened,&#10;and rushed back to the open sea. But she said she should never&#10;forget the beautiful forest, the green hills, and the pretty little&#10;children who could swim in the water, although they had not fish&#39;s&#10;tails.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The fourth sister was more timid; she remained in the&#10;midst of the sea, but she said it was quite as beautiful there as&#10;nearer the land. She could see for so many miles around her, and&#10;the sky above looked like a bell of glass. She had seen the ships,&#10;but at such a great distance that they looked like sea-gulls. The&#10;dolphins sported in the waves, and the great whales spouted water&#10;from their nostrils till it seemed as if a hundred fountains were&#10;playing in every direction.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The fifth sister&#39;s birthday occurred in the winter; so&#10;when her turn came, she saw what the others had not seen the first&#10;time they went up. The sea looked quite green, and large icebergs&#10;were floating about, each like a pearl, she said, but larger and&#10;loftier than the churches built by men. They were of the most&#10;singular shapes, and glittered like diamonds. She had seated&#10;herself upon one of the largest, and let the wind play with her&#10;long hair, and she remarked that all the ships sailed by rapidly,&#10;and steered as far away as they could from the iceberg, as if they&#10;were afraid of it. Towards evening, as the sun went down, dark&#10;clouds covered the sky, the thunder rolled and the lightning&#10;flashed, and the red light glowed on the icebergs as they rocked&#10;and tossed on the heaving sea. On all the ships the sails were&#10;reefed with fear and trembling, while she sat calmly on the&#10;floating iceberg, watching the blue lightning, as it darted its&#10;forked flashes into the sea.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;When first the sisters had permission to rise to the&#10;surface, they were each delighted with the new and beautiful sights&#10;they saw; but now, as grown-up girls, they could go when they&#10;pleased, and they had become indifferent about it. They wished&#10;themselves back again in the water, and after a month had passed&#10;they said it was much more beautiful down below, and pleasanter to&#10;be at home. Yet often, in the evening hours, the five sisters would&#10;twine their arms round each other, and rise to the surface, in a&#10;row. They had more beautiful voices than any human being could&#10;have; and before the approach of a storm, and when they expected a&#10;ship would be lost, they swam before the vessel, and sang sweetly&#10;of the delights to be found in the depths of the sea, and begging&#10;the sailors not to fear if they sank to the bottom. But the sailors&#10;could not understand the song, they took it for the howling of the&#10;storm. And these things were never to be beautiful for them; for if&#10;the ship sank, the men were drowned, and their dead bodies alone&#10;reached the palace of the Sea King.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;When the sisters rose, arm-in-arm, through the water in&#10;this way, their youngest sister would stand quite alone, looking&#10;after them, ready to cry, only that the mermaids have no tears, and&#10;therefore they suffer more. &#34;Oh, were I but fifteen years old,&#34;&#10;said she: &#34;I know that I shall love the world up there, and all the&#10;people who live in it.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;At last she reached her fifteenth year. &#34;Well, now, you&#10;are grown up,&#34; said the old dowager, her grandmother; &#34;so you must&#10;let me adorn you like your other sisters;&#34; and she placed a wreath&#10;of white lilies in her hair, and every flower leaf was half a&#10;pearl. Then the old lady ordered eight great oysters to attach&#10;themselves to the tail of the princess to show her high&#10;rank.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But they hurt me so,&#34; said the little mermaid.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Pride must suffer pain,&#34; replied the old lady. Oh, how&#10;gladly she would have shaken off all this grandeur, and laid aside&#10;the heavy wreath! The red flowers in her own garden would have&#10;suited her much better, but she could not help herself: so she&#10;said, &#34;Farewell,&#34; and rose as lightly as a bubble to the surface of&#10;the water. The sun had just set as she raised her head above the&#10;waves; but the clouds were tinted with crimson and gold, and&#10;through the glimmering twilight beamed the evening star in all its&#10;beauty. The sea was calm, and the air mild and fresh. A large ship,&#10;with three masts, lay becalmed on the water, with only one sail&#10;set; for not a breeze stiffed, and the sailors sat idle on deck or&#10;amongst the rigging. There was music and song on board; and, as&#10;darkness came on, a hundred colored lanterns were lighted, as if&#10;the flags of all nations waved in the air. The little mermaid swam&#10;close to the cabin windows; and now and then, as the waves lifted&#10;her up, she could look in through clear glass window-panes, and see&#10;a number of well-dressed people within. Among them was a young&#10;prince, the most beautiful of all, with large black eyes; he was&#10;sixteen years of age, and his birthday was being kept with much&#10;rejoicing. The sailors were dancing on deck, but when the prince&#10;came out of the cabin, more than a hundred rockets rose in the air,&#10;making it as bright as day. The little mermaid was so startled that&#10;she dived under water; and when she again stretched out her head,&#10;it appeared as if all the stars of heaven were falling around her,&#10;she had never seen such fireworks before. Great suns spurted fire&#10;about, splendid fireflies flew into the blue air, and everything&#10;was reflected in the clear, calm sea beneath. The ship itself was&#10;so brightly illuminated that all the people, and even the smallest&#10;rope, could be distinctly and plainly seen. And how handsome the&#10;young prince looked, as he pressed the hands of all present and&#10;smiled at them, while the music resounded through the clear night&#10;air.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was very late; yet the little mermaid could not take&#10;her eyes from the ship, or from the beautiful prince. The colored&#10;lanterns had been extinguished, no more rockets rose in the air,&#10;and the cannon had ceased firing; but the sea became restless, and&#10;a moaning, grumbling sound could be heard beneath the waves: still&#10;the little mermaid remained by the cabin window, rocking up and&#10;down on the water, which enabled her to look in. After a while, the&#10;sails were quickly unfurled, and the noble ship continued her&#10;passage; but soon the waves rose higher, heavy clouds darkened the&#10;sky, and lightning appeared in the distance. A dreadful storm was&#10;approaching; once more the sails were reefed, and the great ship&#10;pursued her flying course over the raging sea. The waves rose&#10;mountains high, as if they would have overtopped the mast; but the&#10;ship dived like a swan between them, and then rose again on their&#10;lofty, foaming crests. To the little mermaid this appeared pleasant&#10;sport; not so to the sailors. At length the ship groaned and&#10;creaked; the thick planks gave way under the lashing of the sea as&#10;it broke over the deck; the mainmast snapped asunder like a reed;&#10;the ship lay over on her side; and the water rushed in. The little&#10;mermaid now perceived that the crew were in danger; even she&#10;herself was obliged to be careful to avoid the beams and planks of&#10;the wreck which lay scattered on the water. At one moment it was so&#10;pitch dark that she could not see a single object, but a flash of&#10;lightning revealed the whole scene; she could see every one who had&#10;been on board excepting the prince; when the ship parted, she had&#10;seen him sink into the deep waves, and she was glad, for she&#10;thought he would now be with her; and then she remembered that&#10;human beings could not live in the water, so that when he got down&#10;to her father&#39;s palace he would be quite dead. But he must not die.&#10;So she swam about among the beams and planks which strewed the&#10;surface of the sea, forgetting that they could crush her to pieces.&#10;Then she dived deeply under the dark waters, rising and falling&#10;with the waves, till at length she managed to reach the young&#10;prince, who was fast losing the power of swimming in that stormy&#10;sea. His limbs were failing him, his beautiful eyes were closed,&#10;and he would have died had not the little mermaid come to his&#10;assistance. She held his head above the water, and let the waves&#10;drift them where they would.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the morning the storm had ceased; but of the ship not a&#10;single fragment could be seen. The sun rose up red and glowing from&#10;the water, and its beams brought back the hue of health to the&#10;prince&#39;s cheeks; but his eyes remained closed. The mermaid kissed&#10;his high, smooth forehead, and stroked back his wet hair; he seemed&#10;to her like the marble statue in her little garden, and she kissed&#10;him again, and wished that he might live. Presently they came in&#10;sight of land; she saw lofty blue mountains, on which the white&#10;snow rested as if a flock of swans were lying upon them. Near the&#10;coast were beautiful green forests, and close by stood a large&#10;building, whether a church or a convent she could not tell. Orange&#10;and citron trees grew in the garden, and before the door stood&#10;lofty palms. The sea here formed a little bay, in which the water&#10;was quite still, but very deep; so she swam with the handsome&#10;prince to the beach, which was covered with fine, white sand, and&#10;there she laid him in the warm sunshine, taking care to raise his&#10;head higher than his body. Then bells sounded in the large white&#10;building, and a number of young girls came into the garden. The&#10;little mermaid swam out farther from the shore and placed herself&#10;between some high rocks that rose out of the water; then she&#10;covered her head and neck with the foam of the sea so that her&#10;little face might not be seen, and watched to see what would become&#10;of the poor prince. She did not wait long before she saw a young&#10;girl approach the spot where he lay. She seemed frightened at&#10;first, but only for a moment; then she fetched a number of people,&#10;and the mermaid saw that the prince came to life again, and smiled&#10;upon those who stood round him. But to her he sent no smile; he&#10;knew not that she had saved him. This made her very unhappy, and&#10;when he was led away into the great building, she dived down&#10;sorrowfully into the water, and returned to her father&#39;s castle.&#10;She had always been silent and thoughtful, and now she was more so&#10;than ever. Her sisters asked her what she had seen during her first&#10;visit to the surface of the water; but she would tell them nothing.&#10;Many an evening and morning did she rise to the place where she had&#10;left the prince. She saw the fruits in the garden ripen till they&#10;were gathered, the snow on the tops of the mountains melt away; but&#10;she never saw the prince, and therefore she returned home, always&#10;more sorrowful than before. It was her only comfort to sit in her&#10;own little garden, and fling her arm round the beautiful marble&#10;statue which was like the prince; but she gave up tending her&#10;flowers, and they grew in wild confusion over the paths, twining&#10;their long leaves and stems round the branches of the trees, so&#10;that the whole place became dark and gloomy. At length she could&#10;bear it no longer, and told one of her sisters all about it. Then&#10;the others heard the secret, and very soon it became known to two&#10;mermaids whose intimate friend happened to know who the prince was.&#10;She had also seen the festival on board ship, and she told them&#10;where the prince came from, and where his palace stood.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Come, little sister,&#34; said the other princesses; then&#10;they entwined their arms and rose up in a long row to the surface&#10;of the water, close by the spot where they knew the prince&#39;s palace&#10;stood. It was built of bright yellow shining stone, with long&#10;flights of marble steps, one of which reached quite down to the&#10;sea. Splendid gilded cupolas rose over the roof, and between the&#10;pillars that surrounded the whole building stood life-like statues&#10;of marble. Through the clear crystal of the lofty windows could be&#10;seen noble rooms, with costly silk curtains and hangings of&#10;tapestry; while the walls were covered with beautiful paintings&#10;which were a pleasure to look at. In the centre of the largest&#10;saloon a fountain threw its sparkling jets high up into the glass&#10;cupola of the ceiling, through which the sun shone down upon the&#10;water and upon the beautiful plants growing round the basin of the&#10;fountain. Now that she knew where he lived, she spent many an&#10;evening and many a night on the water near the palace. She would&#10;swim much nearer the shore than any of the others ventured to do;&#10;indeed once she went quite up the narrow channel under the marble&#10;balcony, which threw a broad shadow on the water. Here she would&#10;sit and watch the young prince, who thought himself quite alone in&#10;the bright moonlight. She saw him many times of an evening sailing&#10;in a pleasant boat, with music playing and flags waving. She peeped&#10;out from among the green rushes, and if the wind caught her long&#10;silvery-white veil, those who saw it believed it to be a swan,&#10;spreading out its wings. On many a night, too, when the fishermen,&#10;with their torches, were out at sea, she heard them relate so many&#10;good things about the doings of the young prince, that she was glad&#10;she had saved his life when he had been tossed about half-dead on&#10;the waves. And she remembered that his head had rested on her&#10;bosom, and how heartily she had kissed him; but he knew nothing of&#10;all this, and could not even dream of her. She grew more and more&#10;fond of human beings, and wished more and more to be able to wander&#10;about with those whose world seemed to be so much larger than her&#10;own. They could fly over the sea in ships, and mount the high hills&#10;which were far above the clouds; and the lands they possessed,&#10;their woods and their fields, stretched far away beyond the reach&#10;of her sight. There was so much that she wished to know, and her&#10;sisters were unable to answer all her questions. Then she applied&#10;to her old grandmother, who knew all about the upper world, which&#10;she very rightly called the lands above the sea.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;If human beings are not drowned,&#34; asked the little&#10;mermaid, &#34;can they live forever? do they never die as we do here in&#10;the sea?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes,&#34; replied the old lady, &#34;they must also die, and&#10;their term of life is even shorter than ours. We sometimes live to&#10;three hundred years, but when we cease to exist here we only become&#10;the foam on the surface of the water, and we have not even a grave&#10;down here of those we love. We have not immortal souls, we shall&#10;never live again; but, like the green sea-weed, when once it has&#10;been cut off, we can never flourish more. Human beings, on the&#10;contrary, have a soul which lives forever, lives after the body has&#10;been turned to dust. It rises up through the clear, pure air beyond&#10;the glittering stars. As we rise out of the water, and behold all&#10;the land of the earth, so do they rise to unknown and glorious&#10;regions which we shall never see.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Why have not we an immortal soul?&#34; asked the little&#10;mermaid mournfully; &#34;I would give gladly all the hundreds of years&#10;that I have to live, to be a human being only for one day, and to&#10;have the hope of knowing the happiness of that glorious world above&#10;the stars.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You must not think of that,&#34; said the old woman; &#34;we feel&#10;ourselves to be much happier and much better off than human&#10;beings.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;So I shall die,&#34; said the little mermaid, &#34;and as the&#10;foam of the sea I shall be driven about never again to hear the&#10;music of the waves, or to see the pretty flowers nor the red sun.&#10;Is there anything I can do to win an immortal soul?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No,&#34; said the old woman, &#34;unless a man were to love you&#10;so much that you were more to him than his father or mother; and if&#10;all his thoughts and all his love were fixed upon you, and the&#10;priest placed his right hand in yours, and he promised to be true&#10;to you here and hereafter, then his soul would glide into your body&#10;and you would obtain a share in the future happiness of mankind. He&#10;would give a soul to you and retain his own as well; but this can&#10;never happen. Your fish&#39;s tail, which amongst us is considered so&#10;beautiful, is thought on earth to be quite ugly; they do not know&#10;any better, and they think it necessary to have two stout props,&#10;which they call legs, in order to be handsome.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the little mermaid sighed, and looked sorrowfully at&#10;her fish&#39;s tail. &#34;Let us be happy,&#34; said the old lady, &#34;and dart&#10;and spring about during the three hundred years that we have to&#10;live, which is really quite long enough; after that we can rest&#10;ourselves all the better. This evening we are going to have a court&#10;ball.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It is one of those splendid sights which we can never see&#10;on earth. The walls and the ceiling of the large ball-room were of&#10;thick, but transparent crystal. May hundreds of colossal shells,&#10;some of a deep red, others of a grass green, stood on each side in&#10;rows, with blue fire in them, which lighted up the whole saloon,&#10;and shone through the walls, so that the sea was also illuminated.&#10;Innumerable fishes, great and small, swam past the crystal walls;&#10;on some of them the scales glowed with a purple brilliancy, and on&#10;others they shone like silver and gold. Through the halls flowed a&#10;broad stream, and in it danced the mermen and the mermaids to the&#10;music of their own sweet singing. No one on earth has such a lovely&#10;voice as theirs. The little mermaid sang more sweetly than them&#10;all. The whole court applauded her with hands and tails; and for a&#10;moment her heart felt quite gay, for she knew she had the loveliest&#10;voice of any on earth or in the sea. But she soon thought again of&#10;the world above her, for she could not forget the charming prince,&#10;nor her sorrow that she had not an immortal soul like his;&#10;therefore she crept away silently out of her father&#39;s palace, and&#10;while everything within was gladness and song, she sat in her own&#10;little garden sorrowful and alone. Then she heard the bugle&#10;sounding through the water, and thought&#8212;&#34;He is certainly sailing&#10;above, he on whom my wishes depend, and in whose hands I should&#10;like to place the happiness of my life. I will venture all for him,&#10;and to win an immortal soul, while my sisters are dancing in my&#10;father&#39;s palace, I will go to the sea witch, of whom I have always&#10;been so much afraid, but she can give me counsel and&#10;help.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And then the little mermaid went out from her garden, and&#10;took the road to the foaming whirlpools, behind which the sorceress&#10;lived. She had never been that way before: neither flowers nor&#10;grass grew there; nothing but bare, gray, sandy ground stretched&#10;out to the whirlpool, where the water, like foaming mill-wheels,&#10;whirled round everything that it seized, and cast it into the&#10;fathomless deep. Through the midst of these crushing whirlpools the&#10;little mermaid was obliged to pass, to reach the dominions of the&#10;sea witch; and also for a long distance the only road lay right&#10;across a quantity of warm, bubbling mire, called by the witch her&#10;turfmoor. Beyond this stood her house, in the centre of a strange&#10;forest, in which all the trees and flowers were polypi, half&#10;animals and half plants; they looked like serpents with a hundred&#10;heads growing out of the ground. The branches were long slimy arms,&#10;with fingers like flexible worms, moving limb after limb from the&#10;root to the top. All that could be reached in the sea they seized&#10;upon, and held fast, so that it never escaped from their clutches.&#10;The little mermaid was so alarmed at what she saw, that she stood&#10;still, and her heart beat with fear, and she was very nearly&#10;turning back; but she thought of the prince, and of the human soul&#10;for which she longed, and her courage returned. She fastened her&#10;long flowing hair round her head, so that the polypi might not&#10;seize hold of it. She laid her hands together across her bosom, and&#10;then she darted forward as a fish shoots through the water, between&#10;the supple arms and fingers of the ugly polypi, which were&#10;stretched out on each side of her. She saw that each held in its&#10;grasp something it had seized with its numerous little arms, as if&#10;they were iron bands. The white skeletons of human beings who had&#10;perished at sea, and had sunk down into the deep waters, skeletons&#10;of land animals, oars, rudders, and chests of ships were lying&#10;tightly grasped by their clinging arms; even a little mermaid, whom&#10;they had caught and strangled; and this seemed the most shocking of&#10;all to the little princess.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;She now came to a space of marshy ground in the wood,&#10;where large, fat water-snakes were rolling in the mire, and showing&#10;their ugly, drab-colored bodies. In the midst of this spot stood a&#10;house, built with the bones of shipwrecked human beings. There sat&#10;the sea witch, allowing a toad to eat from her mouth, just as&#10;people sometimes feed a canary with a piece of sugar. She called&#10;the ugly water-snakes her little chickens, and allowed them to&#10;crawl all over her bosom.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I know what you want,&#34; said the sea witch; &#34;it is very&#10;stupid of you, but you shall have your way, and it will bring you&#10;to sorrow, my pretty princess. You want to get rid of your fish&#39;s&#10;tail, and to have two supports instead of it, like human beings on&#10;earth, so that the young prince may fall in love with you, and that&#10;you may have an immortal soul.&#34; And then the witch laughed so loud&#10;and disgustingly, that the toad and the snakes fell to the ground,&#10;and lay there wriggling about. &#34;You are but just in time,&#34; said the&#10;witch; &#34;for after sunrise to-morrow I should not be able to help&#10;you till the end of another year. I will prepare a draught for you,&#10;with which you must swim to land tomorrow before sunrise, and sit&#10;down on the shore and drink it. Your tail will then disappear, and&#10;shrink up into what mankind calls legs, and you will feel great&#10;pain, as if a sword were passing through you. But all who see you&#10;will say that you are the prettiest little human being they ever&#10;saw. You will still have the same floating gracefulness of&#10;movement, and no dancer will ever tread so lightly; but at every&#10;step you take it will feel as if you were treading upon sharp&#10;knives, and that the blood must flow. If you will bear all this, I&#10;will help you.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, I will,&#34; said the little princess in a trembling&#10;voice, as she thought of the prince and the immortal&#10;soul.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But think again,&#34; said the witch; &#34;for when once your&#10;shape has become like a human being, you can no more be a mermaid.&#10;You will never return through the water to your sisters, or to your&#10;father&#39;s palace again; and if you do not win the love of the&#10;prince, so that he is willing to forget his father and mother for&#10;your sake, and to love you with his whole soul, and allow the&#10;priest to join your hands that you may be man and wife, then you&#10;will never have an immortal soul. The first morning after he&#10;marries another your heart will break, and you will become foam on&#10;the crest of the waves.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I will do it,&#34; said the little mermaid, and she became&#10;pale as death.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But I must be paid also,&#34; said the witch, &#34;and it is not&#10;a trifle that I ask. You have the sweetest voice of any who dwell&#10;here in the depths of the sea, and you believe that you will be&#10;able to charm the prince with it also, but this voice you must give&#10;to me; the best thing you possess will I have for the price of my&#10;draught. My own blood must be mixed with it, that it may be as&#10;sharp as a two-edged sword.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But if you take away my voice,&#34; said the little mermaid,&#10;&#34;what is left for me?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Your beautiful form, your graceful walk, and your&#10;expressive eyes; surely with these you can enchain a man&#39;s heart.&#10;Well, have you lost your courage? Put out your little tongue that I&#10;may cut it off as my payment; then you shall have the powerful&#10;draught.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It shall be,&#34; said the little mermaid.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the witch placed her cauldron on the fire, to prepare&#10;the magic draught.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Cleanliness is a good thing,&#34; said she, scouring the&#10;vessel with snakes, which she had tied together in a large knot;&#10;then she pricked herself in the breast, and let the black blood&#10;drop into it. The steam that rose formed itself into such horrible&#10;shapes that no one could look at them without fear. Every moment&#10;the witch threw something else into the vessel, and when it began&#10;to boil, the sound was like the weeping of a crocodile. When at&#10;last the magic draught was ready, it looked like the clearest&#10;water. &#34;There it is for you,&#34; said the witch. Then she cut off the&#10;mermaid&#39;s tongue, so that she became dumb, and would never again&#10;speak or sing. &#34;If the polypi should seize hold of you as you&#10;return through the wood,&#34; said the witch, &#34;throw over them a few&#10;drops of the potion, and their fingers will be torn into a thousand&#10;pieces.&#34; But the little mermaid had no occasion to do this, for the&#10;polypi sprang back in terror when they caught sight of the&#10;glittering draught, which shone in her hand like a twinkling&#10;star.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;So she passed quickly through the wood and the marsh, and&#10;between the rushing whirlpools. She saw that in her father&#39;s palace&#10;the torches in the ballroom were extinguished, and all within&#10;asleep; but she did not venture to go in to them, for now she was&#10;dumb and going to leave them forever, she felt as if her heart&#10;would break. She stole into the garden, took a flower from the&#10;flower-beds of each of her sisters, kissed her hand a thousand&#10;times towards the palace, and then rose up through the dark blue&#10;waters. The sun had not risen when she came in sight of the&#10;prince&#39;s palace, and approached the beautiful marble steps, but the&#10;moon shone clear and bright. Then the little mermaid drank the&#10;magic draught, and it seemed as if a two-edged sword went through&#10;her delicate body: she fell into a swoon, and lay like one dead.&#10;When the sun arose and shone over the sea, she recovered, and felt&#10;a sharp pain; but just before her stood the handsome young prince.&#10;He fixed his coal-black eyes upon her so earnestly that she cast&#10;down her own, and then became aware that her fish&#39;s tail was gone,&#10;and that she had as pretty a pair of white legs and tiny feet as&#10;any little maiden could have; but she had no clothes, so she&#10;wrapped herself in her long, thick hair. The prince asked her who&#10;she was, and where she came from, and she looked at him mildly and&#10;sorrowfully with her deep blue eyes; but she could not speak. Every&#10;step she took was as the witch had said it would be, she felt as if&#10;treading upon the points of needles or sharp knives; but she bore&#10;it willingly, and stepped as lightly by the prince&#39;s side as a&#10;soap-bubble, so that he and all who saw her wondered at her&#10;graceful-swaying movements. She was very soon arrayed in costly&#10;robes of silk and muslin, and was the most beautiful creature in&#10;the palace; but she was dumb, and could neither speak nor&#10;sing.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Beautiful female slaves, dressed in silk and gold, stepped&#10;forward and sang before the prince and his royal parents: one sang&#10;better than all the others, and the prince clapped his hands and&#10;smiled at her. This was great sorrow to the little mermaid; she&#10;knew how much more sweetly she herself could sing once, and she&#10;thought, &#34;Oh if he could only know that! I have given away my voice&#10;forever, to be with him.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The slaves next performed some pretty fairy-like dances,&#10;to the sound of beautiful music. Then the little mermaid raised her&#10;lovely white arms, stood on the tips of her toes, and glided over&#10;the floor, and danced as no one yet had been able to dance. At each&#10;moment her beauty became more revealed, and her expressive eyes&#10;appealed more directly to the heart than the songs of the slaves.&#10;Every one was enchanted, especially the prince, who called her his&#10;little foundling; and she danced again quite readily, to please&#10;him, though each time her foot touched the floor it seemed as if&#10;she trod on sharp knives.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The prince said she should remain with him always, and she&#10;received permission to sleep at his door, on a velvet cushion. He&#10;had a page&#39;s dress made for her, that she might accompany him on&#10;horseback. They rode together through the sweet-scented woods,&#10;where the green boughs touched their shoulders, and the little&#10;birds sang among the fresh leaves. She climbed with the prince to&#10;the tops of high mountains; and although her tender feet bled so&#10;that even her steps were marked, she only laughed, and followed him&#10;till they could see the clouds beneath them looking like a flock of&#10;birds travelling to distant lands. While at the prince&#39;s palace,&#10;and when all the household were asleep, she would go and sit on the&#10;broad marble steps; for it eased her burning feet to bathe them in&#10;the cold sea-water; and then she thought of all those below in the&#10;deep.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Once during the night her sisters came up arm-in-arm,&#10;singing sorrowfully, as they floated on the water. She beckoned to&#10;them, and then they recognized her, and told her how she had&#10;grieved them. After that, they came to the same place every night;&#10;and once she saw in the distance her old grandmother, who had not&#10;been to the surface of the sea for many years, and the old Sea&#10;King, her father, with his crown on his head. They stretched out&#10;their hands towards her, but they did not venture so near the land&#10;as her sisters did.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;As the days passed, she loved the prince more fondly, and&#10;he loved her as he would love a little child, but it never came&#10;into his head to make her his wife; yet, unless he married her, she&#10;could not receive an immortal soul; and, on the morning after his&#10;marriage with another, she would dissolve into the foam of the&#10;sea.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Do you not love me the best of them all?&#34; the eyes of the&#10;little mermaid seemed to say, when he took her in his arms, and&#10;kissed her fair forehead.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, you are dear to me,&#34; said the prince; &#34;for you have&#10;the best heart, and you are the most devoted to me; you are like a&#10;young maiden whom I once saw, but whom I shall never meet again. I&#10;was in a ship that was wrecked, and the waves cast me ashore near a&#10;holy temple, where several young maidens performed the service. The&#10;youngest of them found me on the shore, and saved my life. I saw&#10;her but twice, and she is the only one in the world whom I could&#10;love; but you are like her, and you have almost driven her image&#10;out of my mind. She belongs to the holy temple, and my good fortune&#10;has sent you to me instead of her; and we will never&#10;part.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ah, he knows not that it was I who saved his life,&#34;&#10;thought the little mermaid. &#34;I carried him over the sea to the wood&#10;where the temple stands: I sat beneath the foam, and watched till&#10;the human beings came to help him. I saw the pretty maiden that he&#10;loves better than he loves me;&#34; and the mermaid sighed deeply, but&#10;she could not shed tears. &#34;He says the maiden belongs to the holy&#10;temple, therefore she will never return to the world. They will&#10;meet no more: while I am by his side, and see him every day. I will&#10;take care of him, and love him, and give up my life for his&#10;sake.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Very soon it was said that the prince must marry, and that&#10;the beautiful daughter of a neighboring king would be his wife, for&#10;a fine ship was being fitted out. Although the prince gave out that&#10;he merely intended to pay a visit to the king, it was generally&#10;supposed that he really went to see his daughter. A great company&#10;were to go with him. The little mermaid smiled, and shook her head.&#10;She knew the prince&#39;s thoughts better than any of the&#10;others.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I must travel,&#34; he had said to her; &#34;I must see this&#10;beautiful princess; my parents desire it; but they will not oblige&#10;me to bring her home as my bride. I cannot love her; she is not&#10;like the beautiful maiden in the temple, whom you resemble. If I&#10;were forced to choose a bride, I would rather choose you, my dumb&#10;foundling, with those expressive eyes.&#34; And then he kissed her rosy&#10;mouth, played with her long waving hair, and laid his head on her&#10;heart, while she dreamed of human happiness and an immortal soul.&#10;&#34;You are not afraid of the sea, my dumb child,&#34; said he, as they&#10;stood on the deck of the noble ship which was to carry them to the&#10;country of the neighboring king. And then he told her of storm and&#10;of calm, of strange fishes in the deep beneath them, and of what&#10;the divers had seen there; and she smiled at his descriptions, for&#10;she knew better than any one what wonders were at the bottom of the&#10;sea.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the moonlight, when all on board were asleep, excepting&#10;the man at the helm, who was steering, she sat on the deck, gazing&#10;down through the clear water. She thought she could distinguish her&#10;father&#39;s castle, and upon it her aged grandmother, with the silver&#10;crown on her head, looking through the rushing tide at the keel of&#10;the vessel. Then her sisters came up on the waves, and gazed at her&#10;mournfully, wringing their white hands. She beckoned to them, and&#10;smiled, and wanted to tell them how happy and well off she was; but&#10;the cabin-boy approached, and when her sisters dived down he&#10;thought it was only the foam of the sea which he saw.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The next morning the ship sailed into the harbor of a&#10;beautiful town belonging to the king whom the prince was going to&#10;visit. The church bells were ringing, and from the high towers&#10;sounded a flourish of trumpets; and soldiers, with flying colors&#10;and glittering bayonets, lined the rocks through which they passed.&#10;Every day was a festival; balls and entertainments followed one&#10;another.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But the princess had not yet appeared. People said that&#10;she was being brought up and educated in a religious house, where&#10;she was learning every royal virtue. At last she came. Then the&#10;little mermaid, who was very anxious to see whether she was really&#10;beautiful, was obliged to acknowledge that she had never seen a&#10;more perfect vision of beauty. Her skin was delicately fair, and&#10;beneath her long dark eye-lashes her laughing blue eyes shone with&#10;truth and purity.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It was you,&#34; said the prince, &#34;who saved my life when I&#10;lay dead on the beach,&#34; and he folded his blushing bride in his&#10;arms. &#34;Oh, I am too happy,&#34; said he to the little mermaid; &#34;my&#10;fondest hopes are all fulfilled. You will rejoice at my happiness;&#10;for your devotion to me is great and sincere.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The little mermaid kissed his hand, and felt as if her&#10;heart were already broken. His wedding morning would bring death to&#10;her, and she would change into the foam of the sea. All the church&#10;bells rung, and the heralds rode about the town proclaiming the&#10;betrothal. Perfumed oil was burning in costly silver lamps on every&#10;altar. The priests waved the censers, while the bride and&#10;bridegroom joined their hands and received the blessing of the&#10;bishop. The little mermaid, dressed in silk and gold, held up the&#10;bride&#39;s train; but her ears heard nothing of the festive music, and&#10;her eyes saw not the holy ceremony; she thought of the night of&#10;death which was coming to her, and of all she had lost in the&#10;world. On the same evening the bride and bridegroom went on board&#10;ship; cannons were roaring, flags waving, and in the centre of the&#10;ship a costly tent of purple and gold had been erected. It&#10;contained elegant couches, for the reception of the bridal pair&#10;during the night. The ship, with swelling sails and a favorable&#10;wind, glided away smoothly and lightly over the calm sea. When it&#10;grew dark a number of colored lamps were lit, and the sailors&#10;danced merrily on the deck. The little mermaid could not help&#10;thinking of her first rising out of the sea, when she had seen&#10;similar festivities and joys; and she joined in the dance, poised&#10;herself in the air as a swallow when he pursues his prey, and all&#10;present cheered her with wonder. She had never danced so elegantly&#10;before. Her tender feet felt as if cut with sharp knives, but she&#10;cared not for it; a sharper pang had pierced through her heart. She&#10;knew this was the last evening she should ever see the prince, for&#10;whom she had forsaken her kindred and her home; she had given up&#10;her beautiful voice, and suffered unheard-of pain daily for him,&#10;while he knew nothing of it. This was the last evening that she&#10;would breathe the same air with him, or gaze on the starry sky and&#10;the deep sea; an eternal night, without a thought or a dream,&#10;awaited her: she had no soul and now she could never win one. All&#10;was joy and gayety on board ship till long after midnight; she&#10;laughed and danced with the rest, while the thoughts of death were&#10;in her heart. The prince kissed his beautiful bride, while she&#10;played with his raven hair, till they went arm-in-arm to rest in&#10;the splendid tent. Then all became still on board the ship; the&#10;helmsman, alone awake, stood at the helm. The little mermaid leaned&#10;her white arms on the edge of the vessel, and looked towards the&#10;east for the first blush of morning, for that first ray of dawn&#10;that would bring her death. She saw her sisters rising out of the&#10;flood: they were as pale as herself; but their long beautiful hair&#10;waved no more in the wind, and had been cut off.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;We have given our hair to the witch,&#34; said they, &#34;to&#10;obtain help for you, that you may not die to-night. She has given&#10;us a knife: here it is, see it is very sharp. Before the sun rises&#10;you must plunge it into the heart of the prince; when the warm&#10;blood falls upon your feet they will grow together again, and form&#10;into a fish&#39;s tail, and you will be once more a mermaid, and return&#10;to us to live out your three hundred years before you die and&#10;change into the salt sea foam. Haste, then; he or you must die&#10;before sunrise. Our old grandmother moans so for you, that her&#10;white hair is falling off from sorrow, as ours fell under the&#10;witch&#39;s scissors. Kill the prince and come back; hasten: do you not&#10;see the first red streaks in the sky? In a few minutes the sun will&#10;rise, and you must die.&#34; And then they sighed deeply and&#10;mournfully, and sank down beneath the waves.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The little mermaid drew back the crimson curtain of the&#10;tent, and beheld the fair bride with her head resting on the&#10;prince&#39;s breast. She bent down and kissed his fair brow, then&#10;looked at the sky on which the rosy dawn grew brighter and&#10;brighter; then she glanced at the sharp knife, and again fixed her&#10;eyes on the prince, who whispered the name of his bride in his&#10;dreams. She was in his thoughts, and the knife trembled in the hand&#10;of the little mermaid: then she flung it far away from her into the&#10;waves; the water turned red where it fell, and the drops that&#10;spurted up looked like blood. She cast one more lingering,&#10;half-fainting glance at the prince, and then threw herself from the&#10;ship into the sea, and thought her body was dissolving into foam.&#10;The sun rose above the waves, and his warm rays fell on the cold&#10;foam of the little mermaid, who did not feel as if she were dying.&#10;She saw the bright sun, and all around her floated hundreds of&#10;transparent beautiful beings; she could see through them the white&#10;sails of the ship, and the red clouds in the sky; their speech was&#10;melodious, but too ethereal to be heard by mortal ears, as they&#10;were also unseen by mortal eyes. The little mermaid perceived that&#10;she had a body like theirs, and that she continued to rise higher&#10;and higher out of the foam. &#34;Where am I?&#34; asked she, and her voice&#10;sounded ethereal, as the voice of those who were with her; no&#10;earthly music could imitate it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Among the daughters of the air,&#34; answered one of them. &#34;A&#10;mermaid has not an immortal soul, nor can she obtain one unless she&#10;wins the love of a human being. On the power of another hangs her&#10;eternal destiny. But the daughters of the air, although they do not&#10;possess an immortal soul, can, by their good deeds, procure one for&#10;themselves. We fly to warm countries, and cool the sultry air that&#10;destroys mankind with the pestilence. We carry the perfume of the&#10;flowers to spread health and restoration. After we have striven for&#10;three hundred years to all the good in our power, we receive an&#10;immortal soul and take part in the happiness of mankind. You, poor&#10;little mermaid, have tried with your whole heart to do as we are&#10;doing; you have suffered and endured and raised yourself to the&#10;spirit-world by your good deeds; and now, by striving for three&#10;hundred years in the same way, you may obtain an immortal&#10;soul.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The little mermaid lifted her glorified eyes towards the&#10;sun, and felt them, for the first time, filling with tears. On the&#10;ship, in which she had left the prince, there were life and noise;&#10;she saw him and his beautiful bride searching for her; sorrowfully&#10;they gazed at the pearly foam, as if they knew she had thrown&#10;herself into the waves. Unseen she kissed the forehead of her&#10;bride, and fanned the prince, and then mounted with the other&#10;children of the air to a rosy cloud that floated through the&#10;aether.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;After three hundred years, thus shall we float into the&#10;kingdom of heaven,&#34; said she. &#34;And we may even get there sooner,&#34;&#10;whispered one of her companions. &#34;Unseen we can enter the houses of&#10;men, where there are children, and for every day on which we find a&#10;good child, who is the joy of his parents and deserves their love,&#10;our time of probation is shortened. The child does not know, when&#10;we fly through the room, that we smile with joy at his good&#10;conduct, for we can count one year less of our three hundred years.&#10;But when we see a naughty or a wicked child, we shed tears of&#10;sorrow, and for every tear a day is added to our time of trial!&#34;&#10;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode(''), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;THERE was once a woman who wished very much to have a&#10;little child, but she could not obtain her wish. At last she went&#10;to a fairy, and said, &#34;I should so very much like to have a little&#10;child; can you tell me where I can find one?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, that can be easily managed,&#34; said the fairy. &#34;Here is&#10;a barleycorn of a different kind to those which grow in the&#10;farmer&#39;s fields, and which the chickens eat; put it into a&#10;flower-pot, and see what will happen.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Thank you,&#34; said the woman, and she gave the fairy twelve&#10;shillings, which was the price of the barleycorn. Then she went&#10;home and planted it, and immediately there grew up a large handsome&#10;flower, something like a tulip in appearance, but with its leaves&#10;tightly closed as if it were still a bud. &#34;It is a beautiful&#10;flower,&#34; said the woman, and she kissed the red and golden-colored&#10;leaves, and while she did so the flower opened, and she could see&#10;that it was a real tulip. Within the flower, upon the green velvet&#10;stamens, sat a very delicate and graceful little maiden. She was&#10;scarcely half as long as a thumb, and they gave her the name of&#10;&#34;Thumbelina,&#34; or Tiny, because she was so small. A walnut-shell,&#10;elegantly polished, served her for a cradle; her bed was formed of&#10;blue violet-leaves, with a rose-leaf for a counterpane. Here she&#10;slept at night, but during the day she amused herself on a table,&#10;where the woman had placed a plateful of water. Round this plate&#10;were wreaths of flowers with their stems in the water, and upon it&#10;floated a large tulip-leaf, which served Tiny for a boat. Here the&#10;little maiden sat and rowed herself from side to side, with two&#10;oars made of white horse-hair. It really was a very pretty sight.&#10;Tiny could, also, sing so softly and sweetly that nothing like her&#10;singing had ever before been heard. One night, while she lay in her&#10;pretty bed, a large, ugly, wet toad crept through a broken pane of&#10;glass in the window, and leaped right upon the table where Tiny lay&#10;sleeping under her rose-leaf quilt. &#34;What a pretty little wife this&#10;would make for my son, said the toad, and she took up the&#10;walnut-shell in which little Tiny lay asleep, and jumped through&#10;the window with it into the garden.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the swampy margin of a broad stream in the garden lived&#10;the toad, with her son. He was uglier even than his mother, and&#10;when he saw the pretty little maiden in her elegant bed, he could&#10;only cry, &#34;Croak, croak, croak.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Don&#39;t speak so loud, or she will wake,&#34; said the toad,&#10;&#34;and then she might run away, for she is as light as swan&#39;s down.&#10;We will place her on one of the water-lily leaves out in the&#10;stream; it will be like an island to her, she is so light and&#10;small, and then she cannot escape; and, while she is away, we will&#10;make haste and prepare the state-room under the marsh, in which you&#10;are to live when you are married.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Far out in the stream grew a number of water-lilies, with&#10;broad green leaves, which seemed to float on the top of the water.&#10;The largest of these leaves appeared farther off than the rest, and&#10;the old toad swam out to it with the walnut-shell, in which little&#10;Tiny lay still asleep. The tiny little creature woke very early in&#10;the morning, and began to cry bitterly when she found where she&#10;was, for she could see nothing but water on every side of the large&#10;green leaf, and no way of reaching the land. Meanwhile the old toad&#10;was very busy under the marsh, decking her room with rushes and&#10;wild yellow flowers, to make it look pretty for her new&#10;daughter-in-law. Then she swam out with her ugly son to the leaf on&#10;which she had placed poor little Tiny. She wanted to fetch the&#10;pretty bed, that she might put it in the bridal chamber to be ready&#10;for her. The old toad bowed low to her in the water, and said,&#10;&#34;Here is my son, he will be your husband, and you will live happily&#10;in the marsh by the stream.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Croak, croak, croak,&#34; was all her son could say for&#10;himself; so the toad took up the elegant little bed, and swam away&#10;with it, leaving Tiny all alone on the green leaf, where she sat&#10;and wept. She could not bear to think of living with the old toad,&#10;and having her ugly son for a husband. The little fishes, who swam&#10;about in the water beneath, had seen the toad, and heard what she&#10;said, so they lifted their heads above the water to look at the&#10;little maiden. As soon as they caught sight of her, they saw she&#10;was very pretty, and it made them very sorry to think that she must&#10;go and live with the ugly toads. &#34;No, it must never be!&#34; so they&#10;assembled together in the water, round the green stalk which held&#10;the leaf on which the little maiden stood, and gnawed it away at&#10;the root with their teeth. Then the leaf floated down the stream,&#10;carrying Tiny far away out of reach of land.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Tiny sailed past many towns, and the little birds in the&#10;bushes saw her, and sang, &#34;What a lovely little creature;&#34; so the&#10;leaf swam away with her farther and farther, till it brought her to&#10;other lands. A graceful little white butterfly constantly fluttered&#10;round her, and at last alighted on the leaf. Tiny pleased him, and&#10;she was glad of it, for now the toad could not possibly reach her,&#10;and the country through which she sailed was beautiful, and the sun&#10;shone upon the water, till it glittered like liquid gold. She took&#10;off her girdle and tied one end of it round the butterfly, and the&#10;other end of the ribbon she fastened to the leaf, which now glided&#10;on much faster than ever, taking little Tiny with it as she stood.&#10;Presently a large cockchafer flew by; the moment he caught sight of&#10;her, he seized her round her delicate waist with his claws, and&#10;flew with her into a tree. The green leaf floated away on the&#10;brook, and the butterfly flew with it, for he was fastened to it,&#10;and could not get away.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Oh, how frightened little Tiny felt when the cockchafer&#10;flew with her to the tree! But especially was she sorry for the&#10;beautiful white butterfly which she had fastened to the leaf, for&#10;if he could not free himself he would die of hunger. But the&#10;cockchafer did not trouble himself at all about the matter. He&#10;seated himself by her side on a large green leaf, gave her some&#10;honey from the flowers to eat, and told her she was very pretty,&#10;though not in the least like a cockchafer. After a time, all the&#10;cockchafers turned up their feelers, and said, &#34;She has only two&#10;legs! how ugly that looks.&#34; &#34;She has no feelers,&#34; said another.&#10;&#34;Her waist is quite slim. Pooh! she is like a human&#10;being.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh! she is ugly,&#34; said all the lady cockchafers, although&#10;Tiny was very pretty. Then the cockchafer who had run away with&#10;her, believed all the others when they said she was ugly, and would&#10;have nothing more to say to her, and told her she might go where&#10;she liked. Then he flew down with her from the tree, and placed her&#10;on a daisy, and she wept at the thought that she was so ugly that&#10;even the cockchafers would have nothing to say to her. And all the&#10;while she was really the loveliest creature that one could imagine,&#10;and as tender and delicate as a beautiful rose-leaf. During the&#10;whole summer poor little Tiny lived quite alone in the wide forest.&#10;She wove herself a bed with blades of grass, and hung it up under a&#10;broad leaf, to protect herself from the rain. She sucked the honey&#10;from the flowers for food, and drank the dew from their leaves&#10;every morning. So passed away the summer and the autumn, and then&#10;came the winter,&#8212;the long, cold winter. All the birds who had sung&#10;to her so sweetly were flown away, and the trees and the flowers&#10;had withered. The large clover leaf under the shelter of which she&#10;had lived, was now rolled together and shrivelled up, nothing&#10;remained but a yellow withered stalk. She felt dreadfully cold, for&#10;her clothes were torn, and she was herself so frail and delicate,&#10;that poor little Tiny was nearly frozen to death. It began to snow&#10;too; and the snow-flakes, as they fell upon her, were like a whole&#10;shovelful falling upon one of us, for we are tall, but she was only&#10;an inch high. Then she wrapped herself up in a dry leaf, but it&#10;cracked in the middle and could not keep her warm, and she shivered&#10;with cold. Near the wood in which she had been living lay a&#10;corn-field, but the corn had been cut a long time; nothing remained&#10;but the bare dry stubble standing up out of the frozen ground. It&#10;was to her like struggling through a large wood. Oh! how she&#10;shivered with the cold. She came at last to the door of a&#10;field-mouse, who had a little den under the corn-stubble. There&#10;dwelt the field-mouse in warmth and comfort, with a whole roomful&#10;of corn, a kitchen, and a beautiful dining room. Poor little Tiny&#10;stood before the door just like a little beggar-girl, and begged&#10;for a small piece of barley-corn, for she had been without a morsel&#10;to eat for two days.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You poor little creature,&#34; said the field-mouse, who was&#10;really a good old field-mouse, &#34;come into my warm room and dine&#10;with me.&#34; She was very pleased with Tiny, so she said, &#34;You are&#10;quite welcome to stay with me all the winter, if you like; but you&#10;must keep my rooms clean and neat, and tell me stories, for I shall&#10;like to hear them very much.&#34; And Tiny did all the field-mouse&#10;asked her, and found herself very comfortable.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;We shall have a visitor soon,&#34; said the field-mouse one&#10;day; &#34;my neighbor pays me a visit once a week. He is better off&#10;than I am; he has large rooms, and wears a beautiful black velvet&#10;coat. If you could only have him for a husband, you would be well&#10;provided for indeed. But he is blind, so you must tell him some of&#10;your prettiest stories.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But Tiny did not feel at all interested about this&#10;neighbor, for he was a mole. However, he came and paid his visit&#10;dressed in his black velvet coat.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;He is very rich and learned, and his house is twenty&#10;times larger than mine,&#34; said the field-mouse.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;He was rich and learned, no doubt, but he always spoke&#10;slightingly of the sun and the pretty flowers, because he had never&#10;seen them. Tiny was obliged to sing to him, &#34;Lady-bird, lady-bird,&#10;fly away home,&#34; and many other pretty songs. And the mole fell in&#10;love with her because she had such a sweet voice; but he said&#10;nothing yet, for he was very cautious. A short time before, the&#10;mole had dug a long passage under the earth, which led from the&#10;dwelling of the field-mouse to his own, and here she had permission&#10;to walk with Tiny whenever she liked. But he warned them not to be&#10;alarmed at the sight of a dead bird which lay in the passage. It&#10;was a perfect bird, with a beak and feathers, and could not have&#10;been dead long, and was lying just where the mole had made his&#10;passage. The mole took a piece of phosphorescent wood in his mouth,&#10;and it glittered like fire in the dark; then he went before them to&#10;light them through the long, dark passage. When they came to the&#10;spot where lay the dead bird, the mole pushed his broad nose&#10;through the ceiling, the earth gave way, so that there was a large&#10;hole, and the daylight shone into the passage. In the middle of the&#10;floor lay a dead swallow, his beautiful wings pulled close to his&#10;sides, his feet and his head drawn up under his feathers; the poor&#10;bird had evidently died of the cold. It made little Tiny very sad&#10;to see it, she did so love the little birds; all the summer they&#10;had sung and twittered for her so beautifully. But the mole pushed&#10;it aside with his crooked legs, and said, &#34;He will sing no more&#10;now. How miserable it must be to be born a little bird! I am&#10;thankful that none of my children will ever be birds, for they can&#10;do nothing but cry, &#39;Tweet, tweet,&#39; and always die of hunger in the&#10;winter.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, you may well say that, as a clever man!&#34; exclaimed&#10;the field-mouse, &#34;What is the use of his twittering, for when&#10;winter comes he must either starve or be frozen to death. Still&#10;birds are very high bred.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Tiny said nothing; but when the two others had turned&#10;their backs on the bird, she stooped down and stroked aside the&#10;soft feathers which covered the head, and kissed the closed&#10;eyelids. &#34;Perhaps this was the one who sang to me so sweetly in the&#10;summer,&#34; she said; &#34;and how much pleasure it gave me, you dear,&#10;pretty bird.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The mole now stopped up the hole through which the&#10;daylight shone, and then accompanied the lady home. But during the&#10;night Tiny could not sleep; so she got out of bed and wove a large,&#10;beautiful carpet of hay; then she carried it to the dead bird, and&#10;spread it over him; with some down from the flowers which she had&#10;found in the field-mouse&#39;s room. It was as soft as wool, and she&#10;spread some of it on each side of the bird, so that he might lie&#10;warmly in the cold earth. &#34;Farewell, you pretty little bird,&#34; said&#10;she, &#34;farewell; thank you for your delightful singing during the&#10;summer, when all the trees were green, and the warm sun shone upon&#10;us. Then she laid her head on the bird&#39;s breast, but she was&#10;alarmed immediately, for it seemed as if something inside the bird&#10;went &#34;thump, thump.&#34; It was the bird&#39;s heart; he was not really&#10;dead, only benumbed with the cold, and the warmth had restored him&#10;to life. In autumn, all the swallows fly away into warm countries,&#10;but if one happens to linger, the cold seizes it, it becomes&#10;frozen, and falls down as if dead; it remains where it fell, and&#10;the cold snow covers it. Tiny trembled very much; she was quite&#10;frightened, for the bird was large, a great deal larger than&#10;herself,&#8212;she was only an inch high. But she took courage, laid the&#10;wool more thickly over the poor swallow, and then took a leaf which&#10;she had used for her own counterpane, and laid it over the head of&#10;the poor bird. The next morning she again stole out to see him. He&#10;was alive but very weak; he could only open his eyes for a moment&#10;to look at Tiny, who stood by holding a piece of decayed wood in&#10;her hand, for she had no other lantern. &#34;Thank you, pretty little&#10;maiden,&#34; said the sick swallow; &#34;I have been so nicely warmed, that&#10;I shall soon regain my strength, and be able to fly about again in&#10;the warm sunshine.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh,&#34; said she, &#34;it is cold out of doors now; it snows and&#10;freezes. Stay in your warm bed; I will take care of&#10;you.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then she brought the swallow some water in a flower-leaf,&#10;and after he had drank, he told her that he had wounded one of his&#10;wings in a thorn-bush, and could not fly as fast as the others, who&#10;were soon far away on their journey to warm countries. Then at last&#10;he had fallen to the earth, and could remember no more, nor how he&#10;came to be where she had found him. The whole winter the swallow&#10;remained underground, and Tiny nursed him with care and love.&#10;Neither the mole nor the field-mouse knew anything about it, for&#10;they did not like swallows. Very soon the spring time came, and the&#10;sun warmed the earth. Then the swallow bade farewell to Tiny, and&#10;she opened the hole in the ceiling which the mole had made. The sun&#10;shone in upon them so beautifully, that the swallow asked her if&#10;she would go with him; she could sit on his back, he said, and he&#10;would fly away with her into the green woods. But Tiny knew it&#10;would make the field-mouse very grieved if she left her in that&#10;manner, so she said, &#34;No, I cannot.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Farewell, then, farewell, you good, pretty little&#10;maiden,&#34; said the swallow; and he flew out into the&#10;sunshine.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Tiny looked after him, and the tears rose in her eyes. She&#10;was very fond of the poor swallow.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Tweet, tweet,&#34; sang the bird, as he flew out into the&#10;green woods, and Tiny felt very sad. She was not allowed to go out&#10;into the warm sunshine. The corn which had been sown in the field&#10;over the house of the field-mouse had grown up high into the air,&#10;and formed a thick wood to Tiny, who was only an inch in&#10;height.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You are going to be married, Tiny,&#34; said the field-mouse.&#10;&#34;My neighbor has asked for you. What good fortune for a poor child&#10;like you. Now we will prepare your wedding clothes. They must be&#10;both woollen and linen. Nothing must be wanting when you are the&#10;mole&#39;s wife.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Tiny had to turn the spindle, and the field-mouse hired&#10;four spiders, who were to weave day and night. Every evening the&#10;mole visited her, and was continually speaking of the time when the&#10;summer would be over. Then he would keep his wedding-day with Tiny;&#10;but now the heat of the sun was so great that it burned the earth,&#10;and made it quite hard, like a stone. As soon, as the summer was&#10;over, the wedding should take place. But Tiny was not at all&#10;pleased; for she did not like the tiresome mole. Every morning when&#10;the sun rose, and every evening when it went down, she would creep&#10;out at the door, and as the wind blew aside the ears of corn, so&#10;that she could see the blue sky, she thought how beautiful and&#10;bright it seemed out there, and wished so much to see her dear&#10;swallow again. But he never returned; for by this time he had flown&#10;far away into the lovely green forest.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;When autumn arrived, Tiny had her outfit quite ready; and&#10;the field-mouse said to her, &#34;In four weeks the wedding must take&#10;place.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then Tiny wept, and said she would not marry the&#10;disagreeable mole.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Nonsense,&#34; replied the field-mouse. &#34;Now don&#39;t be&#10;obstinate, or I shall bite you with my white teeth. He is a very&#10;handsome mole; the queen herself does not wear more beautiful&#10;velvets and furs. His kitchen and cellars are quite full. You ought&#10;to be very thankful for such good fortune.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;So the wedding-day was fixed, on which the mole was to&#10;fetch Tiny away to live with him, deep under the earth, and never&#10;again to see the warm sun, because he did not like it. The poor&#10;child was very unhappy at the thought of saying farewell to the&#10;beautiful sun, and as the field-mouse had given her permission to&#10;stand at the door, she went to look at it once more.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Farewell bright sun,&#34; she cried, stretching out her arm&#10;towards it; and then she walked a short distance from the house;&#10;for the corn had been cut, and only the dry stubble remained in the&#10;fields. &#34;Farewell, farewell,&#34; she repeated, twining her arm round a&#10;little red flower that grew just by her side. &#34;Greet the little&#10;swallow from me, if you should see him again.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Tweet, tweet,&#34; sounded over her head suddenly. She looked&#10;up, and there was the swallow himself flying close by. As soon as&#10;he spied Tiny, he was delighted; and then she told him how&#10;unwilling she felt to marry the ugly mole, and to live always&#10;beneath the earth, and never to see the bright sun any more. And as&#10;she told him she wept.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Cold winter is coming,&#34; said the swallow, &#34;and I am going&#10;to fly away into warmer countries. Will you go with me? You can sit&#10;on my back, and fasten yourself on with your sash. Then we can fly&#10;away from the ugly mole and his gloomy rooms,&#8212;far away, over the&#10;mountains, into warmer countries, where the sun shines more&#10;brightly&#8212;than here; where it is always summer, and the flowers&#10;bloom in greater beauty. Fly now with me, dear little Tiny; you&#10;saved my life when I lay frozen in that dark passage.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, I will go with you,&#34; said Tiny; and she seated&#10;herself on the bird&#39;s back, with her feet on his outstretched&#10;wings, and tied her girdle to one of his strongest&#10;feathers.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the swallow rose in the air, and flew over forest and&#10;over sea, high above the highest mountains, covered with eternal&#10;snow. Tiny would have been frozen in the cold air, but she crept&#10;under the bird&#39;s warm feathers, keeping her little head uncovered,&#10;so that she might admire the beautiful lands over which they&#10;passed. At length they reached the warm countries, where the sun&#10;shines brightly, and the sky seems so much higher above the earth.&#10;Here, on the hedges, and by the wayside, grew purple, green, and&#10;white grapes; lemons and oranges hung from trees in the woods; and&#10;the air was fragrant with myrtles and orange blossoms. Beautiful&#10;children ran along the country lanes, playing with large gay&#10;butterflies; and as the swallow flew farther and farther, every&#10;place appeared still more lovely.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;At last they came to a blue lake, and by the side of it,&#10;shaded by trees of the deepest green, stood a palace of dazzling&#10;white marble, built in the olden times. Vines clustered round its&#10;lofty pillars, and at the top were many swallows&#39; nests, and one of&#10;these was the home of the swallow who carried Tiny.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;This is my house,&#34; said the swallow; &#34;but it would not do&#10;for you to live there&#8212;you would not be comfortable. You must choose&#10;for yourself one of those lovely flowers, and I will put you down&#10;upon it, and then you shall have everything that you can wish to&#10;make you happy.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That will be delightful,&#34; she said, and clapped her&#10;little hands for joy.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A large marble pillar lay on the ground, which, in&#10;falling, had been broken into three pieces. Between these pieces&#10;grew the most beautiful large white flowers; so the swallow flew&#10;down with Tiny, and placed her on one of the broad leaves. But how&#10;surprised she was to see in the middle of the flower, a tiny little&#10;man, as white and transparent as if he had been made of crystal! He&#10;had a gold crown on his head, and delicate wings at his shoulders,&#10;and was not much larger than Tiny herself. He was the angel of the&#10;flower; for a tiny man and a tiny woman dwell in every flower; and&#10;this was the king of them all.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, how beautiful he is!&#34; whispered Tiny to the&#10;swallow.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The little prince was at first quite frightened at the&#10;bird, who was like a giant, compared to such a delicate little&#10;creature as himself; but when he saw Tiny, he was delighted, and&#10;thought her the prettiest little maiden he had ever seen. He took&#10;the gold crown from his head, and placed it on hers, and asked her&#10;name, and if she would be his wife, and queen over all the&#10;flowers.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;This certainly was a very different sort of husband to the&#10;son of a toad, or the mole, with my black velvet and fur; so she&#10;said, &#34;Yes,&#34; to the handsome prince. Then all the flowers opened,&#10;and out of each came a little lady or a tiny lord, all so pretty it&#10;was quite a pleasure to look at them. Each of them brought Tiny a&#10;present; but the best gift was a pair of beautiful wings, which had&#10;belonged to a large white fly and they fastened them to Tiny&#39;s&#10;shoulders, so that she might fly from flower to flower. Then there&#10;was much rejoicing, and the little swallow who sat above them, in&#10;his nest, was asked to sing a wedding song, which he did as well as&#10;he could; but in his heart he felt sad for he was very fond of&#10;Tiny, and would have liked never to part from her again.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You must not be called Tiny any more,&#34; said the spirit of&#10;the flowers to her. &#34;It is an ugly name, and you are so very&#10;pretty. We will call you Maia.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Farewell, farewell,&#34; said the swallow, with a heavy heart&#10;as he left the warm countries to fly back into Denmark. There he&#10;had a nest over the window of a house in which dwelt the writer of&#10;fairy tales. The swallow sang, &#34;Tweet, tweet,&#34; and from his song&#10;came the whole story. &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')

It was all very well for those who knew&#10;him, but not for strangers.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Little Tuk was left at home to take care of his little&#10;sister, Gustava, who was much younger than himself, and he had to&#10;learn his lessons at the same time, and the two things could not&#10;very well be performed together. The poor boy sat there with his&#10;sister on his lap, and sung to her all the songs he knew, and now&#10;and then he looked into his geography lesson that lay open before&#10;him. By the next morning he had to learn by heart all the towns in&#10;Zealand, and all that could be described of them.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;His mother came home at last, and took little Gustava in&#10;her arms. Then Tuk ran to the window, and read so eagerly that he&#10;nearly read his eyes out; for it had become darker and darker every&#10;minute, and his mother had no money to buy a light.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;There goes the old washerwoman up the lane,&#34; said the&#10;mother, as she looked out of the window; &#34;the poor woman can hardly&#10;drag herself along, and now she had to drag a pail of water from&#10;the well. Be a good boy, Tuk, and run across and help the old&#10;woman, won&#39;t you?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;So Tuk ran across quickly, and helped her, but when he&#10;came back into the room it was quite dark, and there was not a word&#10;said about a light, so he was obliged to go to bed on his little&#10;truckle bedstead, and there he lay and thought of his geography&#10;lesson, and of Zealand, and of all the master had told him. He&#10;ought really to have read it over again, but he could not for want&#10;of light. So he put the geography book under his pillow, for he had&#10;heard that this was a great help towards learning a lesson, but not&#10;always to be depended upon. He still lay thinking and thinking,&#10;when all at once it seemed as if some one kissed him on his eyes&#10;and mouth. He slept and yet he did not sleep; and it appeared as if&#10;the old washerwoman looked at him with kind eyes and said, &#34;It&#10;would be a great pity if you did not know your lesson to-morrow&#10;morning; you helped me, and now I will help you, and Providence&#10;will always keep those who help themselves;&#34; and at the same time&#10;the book under Tuk&#39;s pillow began to move about. &#34;Cluck, cluck,&#10;cluck,&#34; cried a hen as she crept towards him. &#34;I am a hen from&#10;Kjoge,&#34; and then she told him how many inhabitants the town&#10;contained, and about a battle that had been fought there, which&#10;really was not worth speaking of.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Crack, crack,&#34; down fell something. It was a wooden bird,&#10;the parrot which is used as a target as Prastoe. He said there were&#10;as many inhabitants in that town as he had nails in his body. He&#10;was very proud, and said, &#34;Thorwalsden lived close to me, and here&#10;I am now, quite comfortable.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But now little Tuk was no longer in bed; all in a moment&#10;he found himself on horseback. Gallop, gallop, away he went, seated&#10;in front of a richly-attired knight, with a waving plume, who held&#10;him on the saddle, and so they rode through the wood by the old&#10;town of Wordingburg, which was very large and busy. The king&#39;s&#10;castle was surrounded by lofty towers, and radiant light streamed&#10;from all the windows. Within there were songs and dancing; King&#10;Waldemar and the young gayly-dressed ladies of the court were&#10;dancing together. Morning dawned, and as the sun rose, the whole&#10;city and the king&#39;s castle sank suddenly down together. One tower&#10;after another fell, till at last only one remained standing on the&#10;hill where the castle had formerly been.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The town now appeared small and poor, and the school-boys&#10;read in their books, which they carried under their arms, that it&#10;contained two thousand inhabitants; but this was a mere boast, for&#10;it did not contain so many.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And again little Tuk lay in his bed, scarcely knowing&#10;whether he was dreaming or not, for some one stood by&#10;him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Tuk! little Tuk!&#34; said a voice. It was a very little&#10;person who spoke. He was dressed as a sailor, and looked small&#10;enough to be a middy, but he was not one. &#34;I bring you many&#10;greetings from Corsor. It is a rising town, full of life. It has&#10;steamships and mail-coaches. In times past they used to call it&#10;ugly, but that is no longer true. I lie on the sea-shore,&#34; said&#10;Corsor; &#34;I have high-roads and pleasure-gardens; I have given birth&#10;to a poet who was witty and entertaining, which they are not all. I&#10;once wanted to fit out a ship to sail round the world, but I did&#10;not accomplish it, though most likely I might have done so. But I&#10;am fragrant with perfume, for close to my gates most lovely roses&#10;bloom.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then before the eyes of little Tuk appeared a confusion of&#10;colors, red and green; but it cleared off, and he could distinguish&#10;a cliff close to the bay, the slopes of which were quite overgrown&#10;with verdure, and on its summit stood a fine old church with&#10;pointed towers. Springs of water flowed out of the cliff in thick&#10;waterspouts, so that there was a continual splashing. Close by sat&#10;an old king with a golden crown on his white head. This was King&#10;Hroar of the Springs and near the springs stood the town of&#10;Roeskilde, as it is called. Then all the kings and queens of&#10;Denmark went up the ascent to the old church, hand in hand, with&#10;golden crowns on their heads, while the organ played and the&#10;fountains sent forth jets of water.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Little Tuk saw and heard it all. &#34;Don&#39;t forget the names&#10;of these towns,&#34; said King Hroar.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;All at once everything vanished; but where! It seemed to&#10;him like turning over the leaves of a book. And now there stood&#10;before him an old peasant woman, who had come from Soroe where the&#10;grass grows in the market-place. She had a green linen apron thrown&#10;over her head and shoulders, and it was quite wet, as if it had&#10;been raining heavily. &#34;Yes, that it has,&#34; said she, and then, just&#10;as she was going to tell him a great many pretty stories from&#10;Holberg&#39;s comedies, and about Waldemar and Absalom, she suddenly&#10;shrunk up together, and wagged her head as if she were a frog about&#10;to spring. &#34;Croak,&#34; she cried; &#34;it is always wet, and as quiet as&#10;death in Soroe.&#34; Then little Tuk saw she was changed into a frog.&#10;&#34;Croak,&#34; and again she was an old woman. &#34;One must dress according&#10;to the weather,&#34; said she. &#34;It is wet, and my town is just like a&#10;bottle. By the cork we must go in, and by the cork we must come out&#10;again. In olden times I had beautiful fish, and now I have fresh,&#10;rosy-cheeked boys in the bottom of the bottle, and they learn&#10;wisdom, Hebrew and Greek.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Croak.&#34; How it sounded like the cry of the frogs on the&#10;moor, or like the creaking of great boots when some one is&#10;marching,&#8212;always the same tone, so monotonous and wearing, that&#10;little Tuk at length fell fast asleep, and then the sound could not&#10;annoy him. But even in this sleep came a dream or something like&#10;it. His little sister Gustava, with her blue eyes, and fair curly&#10;hair, had grown up a beautiful maiden all at once, and without&#10;having wings she could fly. And they flew together over Zealand,&#10;over green forests and blue lakes.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Hark, so you hear the cock crow, little Tuk.&#10;&#39;Cock-a-doodle-doo.&#39; The fowls are flying out of Kjoge. You shall&#10;have a large farm-yard. You shall never suffer hunger or want. The&#10;bird of good omen shall be yours, and you shall become a rich and&#10;happy man; your house shall rise up like King Waldemar&#39;s towers,&#10;and shall be richly adorned with marble statues, like those at&#10;Prastoe. Understand me well; your name shall travel with fame round&#10;the world like the ship that was to sail from Corsor, and at&#10;Roeskilde,&#8212;Don&#39;t forget the names of the towns, as King Hroar&#10;said,&#8212;you shall speak well and clearly little Tuk, and when at last&#10;you lie in your grave you shall sleep peacefully, as-&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;As if I lay in Soroe,&#34; said little Tuk awaking. It was&#10;bright daylight, and he could not remember his dream, but that was&#10;not necessary, for we are not to know what will happen to us in the&#10;future. Then he sprang out of bed quickly, and read over his lesson&#10;in the book, and knew it all at once quite correctly. The old&#10;washerwoman put her head in at the door, and nodded to him quite&#10;kindly, and said, &#34;Many thanks, you good child, for your help&#10;yesterday. I hope all your beautiful dreams will come&#10;true.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Little Tuk did not at all know what he had dreamt, but One&#10;above did. &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')

She specially loved roses, and therefore she possessed&#10;the most beautiful varieties of this flower, from the wild&#10;hedge-rose, with its apple-scented leaves, to the splendid Provence&#10;rose. They grew near the shelter of the walls, wound themselves&#10;round columns and window-frames, crept along passages and over the&#10;ceilings of the halls. They were of every fragrance and&#10;color.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But care and sorrow dwelt within these halls; the queen&#10;lay upon a sick bed, and the doctors declared that she must die.&#10;&#34;There is still one thing that could save her,&#34; said one of the&#10;wisest among them. &#34;Bring her the loveliest rose in the world; one&#10;which exhibits the purest and brightest love, and if it is brought&#10;to her before her eyes close, she will not die.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then from all parts came those who brought roses that&#10;bloomed in every garden, but they were not the right sort. The&#10;flower must be one from the garden of love; but which of the roses&#10;there showed forth the highest and purest love? The poets sang of&#10;this rose, the loveliest in the world, and each named one which he&#10;considered worthy of that title; and intelligence of what was&#10;required was sent far and wide to every heart that beat with love;&#10;to every class, age, and condition.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No one has yet named the flower,&#34; said the wise man. &#34;No&#10;one has pointed out the spot where it blooms in all its splendor.&#10;It is not a rose from the coffin of Romeo and Juliet, or from the&#10;grave of Walburg, though these roses will live in everlasting song.&#10;It is not one of the roses which sprouted forth from the&#10;blood-stained fame of Winkelreid. The blood which flows from the&#10;breast of a hero who dies for his country is sacred, and his memory&#10;is sweet, and no rose can be redder than the blood which flows from&#10;his veins. Neither is it the magic flower of Science, to obtain&#10;which wondrous flower a man devotes many an hour of his fresh young&#10;life in sleepless nights, in a lonely chamber.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I know where it blooms,&#34; said a happy mother, who came&#10;with her lovely child to the bedside of the queen. &#34;I know where&#10;the loveliest rose in the world is. It is seen on the blooming&#10;cheeks of my sweet child, when it expresses the pure and holy love&#10;of infancy; when refreshed by sleep it opens its eyes, and smiles&#10;upon me with childlike affection.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;This is a lovely rose,&#34; said the wise man; &#34;but there is&#10;one still more lovely.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, one far more lovely,&#34; said one of the women. &#34;I have&#10;seen it, and a loftier and purer rose does not bloom. But it was&#10;white, like the leaves of a blush-rose. I saw it on the cheeks of&#10;the queen. She had taken off her golden crown, and through the&#10;long, dreary night, she carried her sick child in her arms. She&#10;wept over it, kissed it, and prayed for it as only a mother can&#10;pray in that hour of her anguish.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Holy and wonderful in its might is the white rose of&#10;grief, but it is not the one we seek.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No; the loveliest rose in the world I saw at the Lord&#39;s&#10;table,&#34; said the good old bishop. &#34;I saw it shine as if an angel&#39;s&#10;face had appeared. A young maiden knelt at the altar, and renewed&#10;the vows made at her baptism; and there were white roses and red&#10;roses on the blushing cheeks of that young girl. She looked up to&#10;heaven with all the purity and love of her young spirit, in all the&#10;expression of the highest and purest love.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;May she be blessed!&#34; said the wise man: &#34;but no one has&#10;yet named the loveliest rose in the world.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then there came into the room a child&#8212;the queen&#39;s little&#10;son. Tears stood in his eyes, and glistened on his cheeks; he&#10;carried a great book and the binding was of velvet, with silver&#10;clasps. &#34;Mother,&#34; cried the little boy; &#34;only hear what I have&#10;read.&#34; And the child seated himself by the bedside, and read from&#10;the book of Him who suffered death on the cross to save all men,&#10;even who are yet unborn. He read, &#34;Greater love hath no man than&#10;this,&#34; and as he read a roseate hue spread over the cheeks of the&#10;queen, and her eyes became so enlightened and clear, that she saw&#10;from the leaves of the book a lovely rose spring forth, a type of&#10;Him who shed His blood on the cross.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I see it,&#34; she said. &#34;He who beholds this, the loveliest&#10;rose on earth, shall never die.&#34; &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode(''), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;IT was bitterly cold, the sky glittered with stars, and&#10;not a breeze stirred. &#34;Bump&#34;&#8212;an old pot was thrown at a neighbor&#39;s&#10;door; and &#34;bang, bang,&#34; went the guns; for they were greeting the&#10;New Year. It was New Year&#39;s Eve, and the church clock was striking&#10;twelve. &#34;Tan-ta-ra-ra, tan-ta-ra-ra,&#34; sounded the horn, and the&#10;mail-coach came lumbering up. The clumsy vehicle stopped at the&#10;gate of the town; all the places had been taken, for there were&#10;twelve passengers in the coach.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Hurrah! hurrah!&#34; cried the people in the town; for in&#10;every house the New Year was being welcomed; and as the clock&#10;struck, they stood up, the full glasses in their hands, to drink&#10;success to the new comer. &#34;A happy New Year,&#34; was the cry; &#34;a&#10;pretty wife, plenty of money, and no sorrow or care.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The wish passed round, and the glasses clashed together&#10;till they rang again; while before the town-gate the mail coach&#10;stopped with the twelve strange passengers. And who were these&#10;strangers? Each of them had his passport and his luggage with him;&#10;they even brought presents for me, and for you, and for all the&#10;people in the town. &#34;Who were they? what did they want? and what&#10;did they bring with them?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Good-morning,&#34; they cried to the sentry at the&#10;town-gate.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Good-morning,&#34; replied the sentry; for the clock had&#10;struck twelve. &#34;Your name and profession?&#34; asked the sentry of the&#10;one who alighted first from the carriage.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;See for yourself in the passport,&#34; he replied. &#34;I am&#10;myself;&#34; and a famous fellow he looked, arrayed in bear-skin and&#10;fur boots. &#34;I am the man on whom many persons fix their hopes. Come&#10;to me to-morrow, and I&#39;ll give you a New Year&#39;s present. I throw&#10;shillings and pence among the people; I give balls, no less than&#10;thirty-one; indeed, that is the highest number I can spare for&#10;balls. My ships are often frozen in, but in my offices it is warm&#10;and comfortable. My name is JANUARY. I&#39;m a merchant, and I&#10;generally bring my accounts with me.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the second alighted. He seemed a merry fellow. He was&#10;a director of a theatre, a manager of masked balls, and a leader of&#10;all the amusements we can imagine. His luggage consisted of a great&#10;cask.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;We&#39;ll dance the bung out of the cask at carnival time,&#34;&#10;said he; &#34;I&#39;ll prepare a merry tune for you and for myself too.&#10;Unfortunately I have not long to live&#8212;the shortest time, in fact,&#10;of my whole family&#8212;only twenty-eight days. Sometimes they pop me in&#10;a day extra; but I trouble myself very little about that.&#10;Hurrah!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You must not shout so,&#34; said the sentry.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Certainly I may shout,&#34; retorted the man; &#34;I&#39;m Prince&#10;Carnival, travelling under the name of FEBRUARY.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The third now got out. He looked a personification of&#10;fasting; but he carried his nose very high, for he was related to&#10;the &#34;forty (k)nights,&#34; and was a weather prophet. But that is not a&#10;very lucrative office, and therefore he praised fasting. In his&#10;button-hole he carried a little bunch of violets, but they were&#10;very small.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;MARCH, March,&#34; the fourth called after him, slapping him&#10;on the shoulder, &#34;don&#39;t you smell something? Make haste into the&#10;guard room; they&#39;re drinking punch there; that&#39;s your favorite&#10;drink. I can smell it out here already. Forward, Master March.&#34; But&#10;it was not true; the speaker only wanted to remind him of his name,&#10;and to make an APRIL fool of him; for with that fun the fourth&#10;generally began his career. He looked very jovial, did little work,&#10;and had the more holidays. &#34;If the world were only a little more&#10;settled,&#34; said he: &#34;but sometimes I&#39;m obliged to be in a good&#10;humor, and sometimes a bad one, according to circumstances; now&#10;rain, now sunshine. I&#39;m kind of a house agent, also a manager of&#10;funerals. I can laugh or cry, according to circumstances. I have my&#10;summer wardrobe in this box here, but it would be very foolish to&#10;put it on now. Here I am. On Sundays I go out walking in shoes and&#10;white silk stockings, and a muff.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;After him, a lady stepped out of the coach. She called&#10;herself Miss MAY. She wore a summer dress and overshoes; her dress&#10;was a light green, and she wore anemones in her hair. She was so&#10;scented with wild-thyme, that it made the sentry sneeze.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Your health, and God bless you,&#34; was her salutation to&#10;him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;How pretty she was! and such a singer! not a theatre&#10;singer, nor a ballad singer; no, but a singer of the woods; for she&#10;wandered through the gay green forest, and had a concert there for&#10;her own amusement.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Now comes the young lady,&#34; said those in the carriage;&#10;and out stepped a young dame, delicate, proud, and pretty. It was&#10;Mistress JUNE, in whose service people become lazy and fond of&#10;sleeping for hours. She gives a feast on the longest day of the&#10;year, that there may be time for her guests to partake of the&#10;numerous dishes at her table. Indeed, she keeps her own carriage;&#10;but still she travelled by the mail, with the rest, because she&#10;wished to show that she was not high-minded. But she was not&#10;without a protector; her younger brother, JULY, was with her. He&#10;was a plump young fellow, clad in summer garments and wearing a&#10;straw hat. He had but very little luggage with him, because it was&#10;so cumbersome in the great heat; he had, however, swimming-trousers&#10;with him, which are nothing to carry. Then came the mother herself,&#10;in crinoline, Madame AUGUST, a wholesale dealer in fruit,&#10;proprietress of a large number of fish ponds and a land cultivator.&#10;She was fat and heated, yet she could use her hands well, and would&#10;herself carry out beer to the laborers in the field. &#34;In the sweat&#10;of the face shalt thou eat bread,&#34; said she; &#34;it is written in the&#10;Bible.&#34; After work, came the recreations, dancing and playing in&#10;the greenwood, and the &#34;harvest homes.&#34; She was a thorough&#10;housewife.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;After her a man came out of the coach, who is a painter;&#10;he is the great master of colors, and is named SEPTEMBER. The&#10;forest, on his arrival, had to change its colors when he wished it;&#10;and how beautiful are the colors he chooses! The woods glow with&#10;hues of red and gold and brown. This great master painter could&#10;whistle like a blackbird. He was quick in his work, and soon&#10;entwined the tendrils of the hop plant around his beer jug. This&#10;was an ornament to the jug, and he has a great love for ornament.&#10;There he stood with his color pot in his hand, and that was the&#10;whole of his luggage. A land-owner followed, who in the month for&#10;sowing seed attended to the ploughing and was fond of field sports.&#10;Squire OCTOBER brought his dog and his gun with him, and had nuts&#10;in his game bag. &#34;Crack, crack.&#34; He had a great deal of luggage,&#10;even an English plough. He spoke of farming, but what he said could&#10;scarcely be heard for the coughing and gasping of his neighbor. It&#10;was NOVEMBER, who coughed violently as he got out. He had a cold,&#10;which caused him to use his pocket-handkerchief continually; and&#10;yet he said he was obliged to accompany servant girls to their new&#10;places, and initiate them into their winter service. He said he&#10;thought his cold would never leave him when he went out&#10;woodcutting, for he was a master sawyer, and had to supply wood to&#10;the whole parish. He spent his evenings preparing wooden soles for&#10;skates, for he knew, he said, that in a few weeks these shoes would&#10;be wanted for the amusement of skating. At length the last&#10;passenger made her appearance,&#8212;old Mother DECEMBER, with her&#10;fire-stool. The dame was very old, but her eyes glistened like two&#10;stars. She carried on her arm a flower-pot, in which a little&#10;fir-tree was growing. &#34;This tree I shall guard and cherish,&#34; she&#10;said, &#34;that it may grow large by Christmas Eve, and reach from the&#10;ground to the ceiling, to be covered and adorned with flaming&#10;candles, golden apples, and little figures. The fire-stool will be&#10;as warm as a stove, and I shall then bring a story book out of my&#10;pocket, and read aloud till all the children in the room are quite&#10;quiet. Then the little figures on the tree will become lively, and&#10;the little waxen angel at the top spread out his wings of&#10;gold-leaf, and fly down from his green perch. He will kiss every&#10;one in the room, great and small; yes, even the poor children who&#10;stand in the passage, or out in the street singing a carol about&#10;the &#39;Star of Bethlehem.&#39;&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Well, now the coach may drive away,&#34; said the sentry; &#34;we&#10;have the whole twelve. Let the horses be put up.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;First, let all the twelve come to me,&#34; said the captain&#10;on duty, &#34;one after another. The passports I will keep here. Each&#10;of them is available for one month; when that has passed, I shall&#10;write the behavior of each on his passport. Mr. JANUARY, have the&#10;goodness to come here.&#34; And Mr. January stepped forward.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;When a year has passed, I think I shall be able to tell&#10;you what the twelve passengers have brought to you, to me, and to&#10;all of us. Now I do not know, and probably even they don&#39;t know&#10;themselves, for we live in strange times. &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode(''), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;THE storks relate to their little ones a great many&#10;stories, and they are all about moors and reed banks, and suited to&#10;their age and capacity. The youngest of them are quite satisfied&#10;with &#34;kribble, krabble,&#34; or such nonsense, and think it very grand;&#10;but the elder ones want something with a deeper meaning, or at&#10;least something about their own family.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;We are only acquainted with one of the two longest and&#10;oldest stories which the storks relate&#8212;it is about Moses, who was&#10;exposed by his mother on the banks of the Nile, and was found by&#10;the king&#39;s daughter, who gave him a good education, and he&#10;afterwards became a great man; but where he was buried is still&#10;unknown.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Every one knows this story, but not the second; very&#10;likely because it is quite an inland story. It has been repeated&#10;from mouth to mouth, from one stork-mamma to another, for thousands&#10;of years; and each has told it better than the last; and now we&#10;mean to tell it better than all.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The first stork pair who related it lived at the time it&#10;happened, and had their summer residence on the rafters of the&#10;Viking&#39;s house, which stood near the wild moorlands of Wendsyssell;&#10;that is, to speak more correctly, the great moorheath, high up in&#10;the north of Jutland, by the Skjagen peak. This wilderness is still&#10;an immense wild heath of marshy ground, about which we can read in&#10;the &#34;Official Directory.&#34; It is said that in olden times the place&#10;was a lake, the ground of which had heaved up from beneath, and now&#10;the moorland extends for miles in every direction, and is&#10;surrounded by damp meadows, trembling, undulating swamps, and&#10;marshy ground covered with turf, on which grow bilberry bushes and&#10;stunted trees. Mists are almost always hovering over this region,&#10;which, seventy years ago, was overrun with wolves. It may well be&#10;called the Wild Moor; and one can easily imagine, with such a wild&#10;expanse of marsh and lake, how lonely and dreary it must have been&#10;a thousand years ago. Many things may be noticed now that existed&#10;then. The reeds grow to the same height, and bear the same kind of&#10;long, purple-brown leaves, with their feathery tips. There still&#10;stands the birch, with its white bark and its delicate, loosely&#10;hanging leaves; and with regard to the living beings who frequented&#10;this spot, the fly still wears a gauzy dress of the same cut, and&#10;the favorite colors of the stork are white, with black and red for&#10;stockings. The people, certainly, in those days, wore very&#10;different dresses to those they now wear, but if any of them, be he&#10;huntsman or squire, master or servant, ventured on the wavering,&#10;undulating, marshy ground of the moor, they met with the same fate&#10;a thousand years ago as they would now. The wanderer sank, and went&#10;down to the Marsh King, as he is named, who rules in the great&#10;moorland empire beneath. They also called him &#34;Gunkel King,&#34; but we&#10;like the name of &#34;Marsh King&#34; better, and we will give him that&#10;name as the storks do. Very little is known of the Marsh King&#39;s&#10;rule, but that, perhaps, is a good thing.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the neighborhood of the moorlands, and not far from the&#10;great arm of the North Sea and the Cattegat which is called the&#10;Lumfjorden, lay the castle of the Viking, with its water-tight&#10;stone cellars, its tower, and its three projecting storeys. On the&#10;ridge of the roof the stork had built his nest, and there the&#10;stork-mamma sat on her eggs and felt sure her hatching would come&#10;to something.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;One evening, stork-papa stayed out rather late, and when&#10;he came home he seemed quite busy, bustling, and important. &#34;I have&#10;something very dreadful to tell you,&#34; said he to the&#10;stork-mamma.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Keep it to yourself then,&#34; she replied. &#34;Remember that I&#10;am hatching eggs; it may agitate me, and will affect&#10;them.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You must know it at once,&#34; said he. &#34;The daughter of our&#10;host in Egypt has arrived here. She has ventured to take this&#10;journey, and now she is lost.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;She who sprung from the race of the fairies, is it?&#34;&#10;cried the mother stork. &#34;Oh, tell me all about it; you know I&#10;cannot bear to be kept waiting at a time when I am hatching&#10;eggs.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Well, you see, mother,&#34; he replied, &#34;she believed what&#10;the doctors said, and what I have heard you state also, that the&#10;moor-flowers which grow about here would heal her sick father; and&#10;she has flown to the north in swan&#39;s plumage, in company with some&#10;other swan-princesses, who come to these parts every year to renew&#10;their youth. She came, and where is she now!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You enter into particulars too much,&#34; said the mamma&#10;stork, &#34;and the eggs may take cold; I cannot bear such suspense as&#10;this.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Well,&#34; said he, &#34;I have kept watch; and this evening I&#10;went among the rushes where I thought the marshy ground would bear&#10;me, and while I was there three swans came. Something in their&#10;manner of flying seemed to say to me, &#39;Look carefully now; there is&#10;one not all swan, only swan&#39;s feathers.&#39; You know, mother, you have&#10;the same intuitive feeling that I have; you know whether a thing is&#10;right or not immediately.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, of course,&#34; said she; &#34;but tell me about the&#10;princess; I am tired of hearing about the swan&#39;s&#10;feathers.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Well, you know that in the middle of the moor there is&#10;something like a lake,&#34; said the stork-papa. &#34;You can see the edge&#10;of it if you raise yourself a little. Just there, by the reeds and&#10;the green banks, lay the trunk of an elder-tree; upon this the&#10;three swans stood flapping their wings, and looking about them; one&#10;of them threw off her plumage, and I immediately recognized her as&#10;one of the princesses of our home in Egypt. There she sat, without&#10;any covering but her long, black hair. I heard her tell the two&#10;others to take great care of the swan&#39;s plumage, while she dipped&#10;down into the water to pluck the flowers which she fancied she saw&#10;there. The others nodded, and picked up the feather dress, and took&#10;possession of it. I wonder what will become of it? thought I, and&#10;she most likely asked herself the same question. If so, she&#10;received an answer, a very practical one; for the two swans rose up&#10;and flew away with her swan&#39;s plumage. &#39;Dive down now!&#39; they cried;&#10;&#39;thou shalt never more fly in the swan&#39;s plumage, thou shalt never&#10;again see Egypt; here, on the moor, thou wilt remain.&#39; So saying,&#10;they tore the swan&#39;s plumage into a thousand pieces, the feathers&#10;drifted about like a snow-shower, and then the two deceitful&#10;princesses flew away.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Why, that is terrible,&#34; said the stork-mamma; &#34;I feel as&#10;if I could hardly bear to hear any more, but you must tell me what&#10;happened next.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The princess wept and lamented aloud; her tears moistened&#10;the elder stump, which was really not an elder stump but the Marsh&#10;King himself, he who in marshy ground lives and rules. I saw myself&#10;how the stump of the tree turned round, and was a tree no more,&#10;while long, clammy branches like arms, were extended from it. Then&#10;the poor child was terribly frightened, and started up to run away.&#10;She hastened to cross the green, slimy ground; but it will not bear&#10;any weight, much less hers. She quickly sank, and the elder stump&#10;dived immediately after her; in fact, it was he who drew her down.&#10;Great black bubbles rose up out of the moor-slime, and with these&#10;every trace of the two vanished. And now the princess is buried in&#10;the wild marsh, she will never now carry flowers to Egypt to cure&#10;her father. It would have broken your heart, mother, had you seen&#10;it.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You ought not to have told me,&#34; said she, &#34;at such a time&#10;as this; the eggs might suffer. But I think the princess will soon&#10;find help; some one will rise up to help her. Ah! if it had been&#10;you or I, or one of our people, it would have been all over with&#10;us.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;I mean to go every day,&#34; said he, &#34;to see if anything&#10;comes to pass;&#34; and so he did.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A long time went by, but at last he saw a green stalk&#10;shooting up out of the deep, marshy ground. As it reached the&#10;surface of the marsh, a leaf spread out, and unfolded itself&#10;broader and broader, and close to it came forth a bud.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;One morning, when the stork-papa was flying over the stem,&#10;he saw that the power of the sun&#39;s rays had caused the bud to open,&#10;and in the cup of the flower lay a charming child&#8212;a little maiden,&#10;looking as if she had just come out of a bath. The little one was&#10;so like the Egyptian princess, that the stork, at the first moment,&#10;thought it must be the princess herself, but after a little&#10;reflection he decided that it was much more likely to be the&#10;daughter of the princess and the Marsh King; and this explained&#10;also her being placed in the cup of a water-lily. &#34;But she cannot&#10;be left to lie here,&#34; thought the stork, &#34;and in my nest there are&#10;already so many. But stay, I have thought of something: the wife of&#10;the Viking has no children, and how often she has wished for a&#10;little one. People always say the stork brings the little ones; I&#10;will do so in earnest this time. I shall fly with the child to the&#10;Viking&#39;s wife; what rejoicing there will be!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And then the stork lifted the little girl out of the&#10;flower-cup, flew to the castle, picked a hole with his beak in the&#10;bladder-covered, window, and laid the beautiful child in the bosom&#10;of the Viking&#39;s wife. Then he flew back quickly to the stork-mamma&#10;and told her what he had seen and done; and the little storks&#10;listened to it all, for they were then quite old enough to do so.&#10;&#34;So you see,&#34; he continued, &#34;that the princess is not dead, for she&#10;must have sent her little one up here; and now I have found a home&#10;for her.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ah, I said it would be so from the first,&#34; replied the&#10;stork-mamma; &#34;but now think a little of your own family. Our&#10;travelling time draws near, and I sometimes feel a little&#10;irritation already under the wings. The cuckoos and the nightingale&#10;are already gone, and I heard the quails say they should go too as&#10;soon as the wind was favorable. Our youngsters will go through all&#10;the manoeuvres at the review very well, or I am much mistaken in&#10;them.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Viking&#39;s wife was above measure delighted when she&#10;awoke the next morning and found the beautiful little child lying&#10;in her bosom. She kissed it and caressed it; but it cried terribly,&#10;and struck out with its arms and legs, and did not seem to be&#10;pleased at all. At last it cried itself to sleep; and as it lay&#10;there so still and quiet, it was a most beautiful sight to see. The&#10;Viking&#39;s wife was so delighted, that body and soul were full of&#10;joy. Her heart felt so light within her, that it seemed as if her&#10;husband and his soldiers, who were absent, must come home as&#10;suddenly and unexpectedly as the little child had done. She and her&#10;whole household therefore busied themselves in preparing everything&#10;for the reception of her lord. The long, colored tapestry, on which&#10;she and her maidens had worked pictures of their idols, Odin, Thor,&#10;and Friga, was hung up. The slaves polished the old shields that&#10;served as ornaments; cushions were placed on the seats, and dry&#10;wood laid on the fireplaces in the centre of the hall, so that the&#10;flames might be fanned up at a moment&#39;s notice. The Viking&#39;s wife&#10;herself assisted in the work, so that at night she felt very tired,&#10;and quickly fell into a sound sleep. When she awoke, just before&#10;morning, she was terribly alarmed to find that the infant had&#10;vanished. She sprang from her couch, lighted a pine-chip, and&#10;searched all round the room, when, at last, in that part of the bed&#10;where her feet had been, lay, not the child, but a great, ugly&#10;frog. She was quite disgusted at this sight, and seized a heavy&#10;stick to kill the frog; but the creature looked at her with such&#10;strange, mournful eyes, that she was unable to strike the blow.&#10;Once more she searched round the room; then she started at hearing&#10;the frog utter a low, painful croak. She sprang from the couch and&#10;opened the window hastily; at the same moment the sun rose, and&#10;threw its beams through the window, till it rested on the couch&#10;where the great frog lay. Suddenly it appeared as if the frog&#39;s&#10;broad mouth contracted, and became small and red. The limbs moved&#10;and stretched out and extended themselves till they took a&#10;beautiful shape; and behold there was the pretty child lying before&#10;her, and the ugly frog was gone. &#34;How is this?&#34; she cried, &#34;have I&#10;had a wicked dream? Is it not my own lovely cherub that lies&#10;there.&#34; Then she kissed it and fondled it; but the child struggled&#10;and fought, and bit as if she had been a little wild&#10;cat.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Viking did not return on that day, nor the next; he&#10;was, however, on the way home; but the wind, so favorable to the&#10;storks, was against him; for it blew towards the south. A wind in&#10;favor of one is often against another.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;After two or three days had passed, it became clear to the&#10;Viking&#39;s wife how matters stood with the child; it was under the&#10;influence of a powerful sorcerer. By day it was charming in&#10;appearance as an angel of light, but with a temper wicked and wild;&#10;while at night, in the form of an ugly frog, it was quiet and&#10;mournful, with eyes full of sorrow. Here were two natures, changing&#10;inwardly and outwardly with the absence and return of sunlight. And&#10;so it happened that by day the child, with the actual form of its&#10;mother, possessed the fierce disposition of its father; at night,&#10;on the contrary, its outward appearance plainly showed its descent&#10;on the father&#39;s side, while inwardly it had the heart and mind of&#10;its mother. Who would be able to loosen this wicked charm which the&#10;sorcerer had worked upon it? The wife of the Viking lived in&#10;constant pain and sorrow about it. Her heart clung to the little&#10;creature, but she could not explain to her husband the&#10;circumstances in which it was placed. He was expected to return&#10;shortly; and were she to tell him, he would very likely, as was the&#10;custom at that time, expose the poor child in the public highway,&#10;and let any one take it away who would. The good wife of the Viking&#10;could not let that happen, and she therefore resolved that the&#10;Viking should never see the child excepting by daylight.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;One morning there sounded a rushing of storks&#39; wings over&#10;the roof. More than a hundred pair of storks had rested there&#10;during the night, to recover themselves after their excursion; and&#10;now they soared aloft, and prepared for the journey&#10;southward.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;All the husbands are here, and ready!&#34; they cried; &#34;wives&#10;and children also!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;How light we are!&#34; screamed the young storks in chorus.&#10;&#34;Something pleasant seems creeping over us, even down to our toes,&#10;as if we were full of live frogs. Ah, how delightful it is to&#10;travel into foreign lands!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Hold yourselves properly in the line with us,&#34; cried papa&#10;and mamma. &#34;Do not use your beaks so much; it tries the lungs.&#34; And&#10;then the storks flew away.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;About the same time sounded the clang of the warriors&#39;&#10;trumpets across the heath. The Viking had landed with his men. They&#10;were returning home, richly laden with spoil from the Gallic coast,&#10;where the people, as did also the inhabitants of Britain, often&#10;cried in alarm, &#34;Deliver us from the wild northmen.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Life and noisy pleasure came with them into the castle of&#10;the Viking on the moorland. A great cask of mead was drawn into the&#10;hall, piles of wood blazed, cattle were slain and served up, that&#10;they might feast in reality, The priest who offered the sacrifice&#10;sprinkled the devoted parishioners with the warm blood; the fire&#10;crackled, and the smoke rolled along beneath the roof; the soot&#10;fell upon them from the beams; but they were used to all these&#10;things. Guests were invited, and received handsome presents. All&#10;wrongs and unfaithfulness were forgotten. They drank deeply, and&#10;threw in each other&#39;s faces the bones that were left, which was&#10;looked upon as a sign of good feeling amongst them. A bard, who was&#10;a kind of musician as well as warrior, and who had been with the&#10;Viking in his expedition, and knew what to sing about, gave them&#10;one of his best songs, in which they heard all their warlike deeds&#10;praised, and every wonderful action brought forward with honor.&#10;Every verse ended with this refrain,&#8212;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Gold and possessions will flee away,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Friends and foes must die one day;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Every man on earth must die,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;But a famous name will never die.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And with that they beat upon their shields, and hammered&#10;upon the table with knives and bones, in a most outrageous&#10;manner.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Viking&#39;s wife sat upon a raised cross seat in the open&#10;hall. She wore a silk dress, golden bracelets, and large amber&#10;beads. She was in costly attire, and the bard named her in his&#10;song, and spoke of the rich treasure of gold which she had brought&#10;to her husband. Her husband had already seen the wonderfully&#10;beautiful child in the daytime, and was delighted with her beauty;&#10;even her wild ways pleased him. He said the little maiden would&#10;grow up to be a heroine, with the strong will and determination of&#10;a man. She would never wink her eyes, even if, in joke, an expert&#10;hand should attempt to cut off her eye-brows with a sharp&#10;sword.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The full cask of mead soon became empty, and a fresh one&#10;was brought in; for these were people who liked plenty to eat and&#10;drink. The old proverb, which every one knows, says that &#34;the&#10;cattle know when to leave their pasture, but a foolish man knows&#10;not the measure of his own appetite.&#34; Yes, they all knew this; but&#10;men may know what is right, and yet often do wrong. They also knew&#10;&#34;that even the welcome guest becomes wearisome when he sits too&#10;long in the house.&#34; But there they remained; for pork and mead are&#10;good things. And so at the Viking&#39;s house they stayed, and enjoyed&#10;themselves; and at night the bondmen slept in the ashes, and dipped&#10;their fingers in the fat, and licked them. Oh, it was a delightful&#10;time!&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Once more in the same year the Viking went forth, though&#10;the storms of autumn had already commenced to roar. He went with&#10;his warriors to the coast of Britain; he said that it was but an&#10;excursion of pleasure across the water, so his wife remained at&#10;home with the little girl. After a while, it is quite certain the&#10;foster-mother began to love the poor frog, with its gentle eyes and&#10;its deep sighs, even better than the little beauty who bit and&#10;fought with all around her.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The heavy, damp mists of autumn, which destroy the leaves&#10;of the wood, had already fallen upon forest and heath. Feathers of&#10;plucked birds, as they call the snow, flew about in thick showers,&#10;and winter was coming. The sparrows took possession of the stork&#39;s&#10;nest, and conversed about the absent owners in their own fashion;&#10;and they, the stork pair and all their young ones, where were they&#10;staying now? The storks might have been found in the land of Egypt,&#10;where the sun&#39;s rays shone forth bright and warm, as it does here&#10;at midsummer. Tamarinds and acacias were in full bloom all over the&#10;country, the crescent of Mahomet glittered brightly from the&#10;cupolas of the mosques, and on the slender pinnacles sat many of&#10;the storks, resting after their long journey. Swarms of them took&#10;divided possession of the nests&#8212;nests which lay close to each other&#10;between the venerable columns, and crowded the arches of temples in&#10;forgotten cities. The date and the palm lifted themselves as a&#10;screen or as a sun-shade over them. The gray pyramids looked like&#10;broken shadows in the clear air and the far-off desert, where the&#10;ostrich wheels his rapid flight, and the lion, with his subtle&#10;eyes, gazes at the marble sphinx which lies half buried in sand.&#10;The waters of the Nile had retreated, and the whole bed of the&#10;river was covered with frogs, which was a most acceptable prospect&#10;for the stork families. The young storks thought their eyes&#10;deceived them, everything around appeared so beautiful.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It is always like this here, and this is how we live in&#10;our warm country,&#34; said the stork-mamma; and the thought made the&#10;young ones almost beside themselves with pleasure.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Is there anything more to see?&#34; they asked; &#34;are we going&#10;farther into the country?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;There is nothing further for us to see,&#34; answered the&#10;stork-mamma. &#34;Beyond this delightful region there are immense&#10;forests, where the branches of the trees entwine round each other,&#10;while prickly, creeping plants cover the paths, and only an&#10;elephant could force a passage for himself with his great feet. The&#10;snakes are too large, and the lizards too lively for us to catch.&#10;Then there is the desert; if you went there, your eyes would soon&#10;be full of sand with the lightest breeze, and if it should blow&#10;great guns, you would most likely find yourself in a sand-drift.&#10;Here is the best place for you, where there are frogs and locusts;&#10;here I shall remain, and so must you.&#34; And so they&#10;stayed.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The parents sat in the nest on the slender minaret, and&#10;rested, yet still were busily employed in cleaning and smoothing&#10;their feathers, and in sharpening their beaks against their red&#10;stockings; then they would stretch out their necks, salute each&#10;other, and gravely raise their heads with the high-polished&#10;forehead, and soft, smooth feathers, while their brown eyes shone&#10;with intelligence. The female young ones strutted about amid the&#10;moist rushes, glancing at the other young storks and making&#10;acquaintances, and swallowing a frog at every third step, or&#10;tossing a little snake about with their beaks, in a way they&#10;considered very becoming, and besides it tasted very good. The&#10;young male storks soon began to quarrel; they struck at each other&#10;with their wings, and pecked with their beaks till the blood came.&#10;And in this manner many of the young ladies and gentlemen were&#10;betrothed to each other: it was, of course, what they wanted, and&#10;indeed what they lived for. Then they returned to a nest, and there&#10;the quarrelling began afresh; for in hot countries people are&#10;almost all violent and passionate. But for all that it was&#10;pleasant, especially for the old people, who watched them with&#10;great joy: all that their young ones did suited them. Every day&#10;here there was sunshine, plenty to eat, and nothing to think of but&#10;pleasure. But in the rich castle of their Egyptian host, as they&#10;called him, pleasure was not to be found. The rich and mighty lord&#10;of the castle lay on his couch, in the midst of the great hall,&#10;with its many colored walls looking like the centre of a great&#10;tulip; but he was stiff and powerless in all his limbs, and lay&#10;stretched out like a mummy. His family and servants stood round&#10;him; he was not dead, although he could scarcely be said to live.&#10;The healing moor-flower from the north, which was to have been&#10;found and brought to him by her who loved him so well, had not&#10;arrived. His young and beautiful daughter who, in swan&#39;s plumage,&#10;had flown over land and seas to the distant north, had never&#10;returned. She is dead, so the two swan-maidens had said when they&#10;came home; and they made up quite a story about her, and this is&#10;what they told,&#8212;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;We three flew away together through the air,&#34; said they:&#10;&#34;a hunter caught sight of us, and shot at us with an arrow. The&#10;arrow struck our young friend and sister, and slowly singing her&#10;farewell song she sank down, a dying swan, into the forest lake. On&#10;the shores of the lake, under a spreading birch-tree, we laid her&#10;in the cold earth. We had our revenge; we bound fire under the&#10;wings of a swallow, who had a nest on the thatched roof of the&#10;huntsman. The house took fire, and burst into flames; the hunter&#10;was burnt with the house, and the light was reflected over the sea&#10;as far as the spreading birch, beneath which we laid her sleeping&#10;dust. She will never return to the land of Egypt.&#34; And then they&#10;both wept. And stork-papa, who heard the story, snapped with his&#10;beak so that it might be heard a long way off.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#39;Deceit and lies!&#34; cried he; &#34;I should like to run my beak&#10;deep into their chests.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And perhaps break it off,&#34; said the mamma stork, &#34;then&#10;what a sight you would be. Think first of yourself, and then of&#10;your family; all others are nothing to us.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, I know,&#34; said the stork-papa; &#34;but to-morrow I can&#10;easily place myself on the edge of the open cupola, when the&#10;learned and wise men assemble to consult on the state of the sick&#10;man; perhaps they may come a little nearer to the truth.&#34; And the&#10;learned and wise men assembled together, and talked a great deal on&#10;every point; but the stork could make no sense out of anything they&#10;said; neither were there any good results from their consultations,&#10;either for the sick man, or for his daughter in the marshy heath.&#10;When we listen to what people say in this world, we shall hear a&#10;great deal; but it is an advantage to know what has been said and&#10;done before, when we listen to a conversation. The stork did, and&#10;we know at least as much as he, the stork.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Love is a life-giver. The highest love produces the&#10;highest life. Only through love can the sick man be cured.&#34; This&#10;had been said by many, and even the learned men acknowledged that&#10;it was a wise saying.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What a beautiful thought!&#34; exclaimed the papa stork&#10;immediately.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I don&#39;t quite understand it,&#34; said the mamma stork, when&#10;her husband repeated it; &#34;however, it is not my fault, but the&#10;fault of the thought; whatever it may be, I have something else to&#10;think of.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Now the learned men had spoken also of love between this&#10;one and that one; of the difference of the love which we have for&#10;our neighbor, to the love that exists between parents and children;&#10;of the love of the plant for the light, and how the germ springs&#10;forth when the sunbeam kisses the ground. All these things were so&#10;elaborately and learnedly explained, that it was impossible for&#10;stork-papa to follow it, much less to talk about it. His thoughts&#10;on the subject quite weighed him down; he stood the whole of the&#10;following day on one leg, with half-shut eyes, thinking deeply. So&#10;much learning was quite a heavy weight for him to carry. One thing,&#10;however, the papa stork could understand. Every one, high and low,&#10;had from their inmost hearts expressed their opinion that it was a&#10;great misfortune for so many thousands of people&#8212;the whole country&#10;indeed&#8212;to have this man so sick, with no hopes of his recovery. And&#10;what joy and blessing it would spread around if he could by any&#10;means be cured! But where bloomed the flower that could bring him&#10;health? They had searched for it everywhere; in learned writings,&#10;in the shining stars, in the weather and wind. Inquiries had been&#10;made in every by-way that could be thought of, until at last the&#10;wise and learned men has asserted, as we have been already told,&#10;that &#34;love, the life-giver, could alone give new life to a father;&#34;&#10;and in saying this, they had overdone it, and said more than they&#10;understood themselves. They repeated it, and wrote it down as a&#10;recipe, &#34;Love is a life-giver.&#34; But how could such a recipe be&#10;prepared&#8212;that was a difficulty they could not overcome. At last it&#10;was decided that help could only come from the princess herself,&#10;whose whole soul was wrapped up in her father, especially as a plan&#10;had been adopted by her to enable her to obtain a&#10;remedy.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;More than a year had passed since the princess had set out&#10;at night, when the light of the young moon was soon lost beneath&#10;the horizon. She had gone to the marble sphinx in the desert,&#10;shaking the sand from her sandals, and then passed through the long&#10;passage, which leads to the centre of one of the great pyramids,&#10;where the mighty kings of antiquity, surrounded with pomp and&#10;splendor, lie veiled in the form of mummies. She had been told by&#10;the wise men, that if she laid her head on the breast of one of&#10;them, from the head she would learn where to find life and recovery&#10;for her father. She had performed all this, and in a dream had&#10;learnt that she must bring home to her father the lotus flower,&#10;which grows in the deep sea, near the moors and heath in the Danish&#10;land. The very place and situation had been pointed out to her, and&#10;she was told that the flower would restore her father to health and&#10;strength. And, therefore, she had gone forth from the land of&#10;Egypt, flying over to the open marsh and the wild moor in the&#10;plumage of a swan.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The papa and mamma storks knew all this, and we also know&#10;it now. We know, too, that the Marsh King has drawn her down to&#10;himself, and that to the loved ones at home she is forever dead.&#10;One of the wisest of them said, as the stork-mamma also said, &#34;That&#10;in some way she would, after all, manage to succeed;&#34; and so at&#10;last they comforted themselves with this hope, and would wait&#10;patiently; in fact, they could do nothing better.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I should like to get away the swan&#39;s feathers from those&#10;two treacherous princesses,&#34; said the papa stork; &#34;then, at least,&#10;they would not be able to fly over again to the wild moor, and do&#10;more wickedness. I can hide the two suits of feathers over yonder,&#10;till we find some use for them.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But where will you put them?&#34; asked the mamma&#10;stork.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;In our nest on the moor. I and the young ones will carry&#10;them by turns during our flight across; and as we return, should&#10;they prove too heavy for us, we shall be sure to find plenty of&#10;places on the way in which we can conceal them till our next&#10;journey. Certainly one suit of swan&#39;s feathers would be enough for&#10;the princess, but two are always better. In those northern&#10;countries no one can have too many travelling wrappers.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No one will thank you for it,&#34; said stork-mamma; &#34;but you&#10;are master; and, excepting at breeding time, I have nothing to&#10;say.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the Viking&#39;s castle on the wild moor, to which the&#10;storks directed their flight in the following spring, the little&#10;maiden still remained. They had named her Helga, which was rather&#10;too soft a name for a child with a temper like hers, although her&#10;form was still beautiful. Every month this temper showed itself in&#10;sharper outlines; and in the course of years, while the storks&#10;still made the same journeys in autumn to the hill, and in spring&#10;to the moors, the child grew to be almost a woman, and before any&#10;one seemed aware of it, she was a wonderfully beautiful maiden of&#10;sixteen. The casket was splendid, but the contents were worthless.&#10;She was, indeed, wild and savage even in those hard, uncultivated&#10;times. It was a pleasure to her to splash about with her white&#10;hands in the warm blood of the horse which had been slain for&#10;sacrifice. In one of her wild moods she bit off the head of the&#10;black cock, which the priest was about to slay for the sacrifice.&#10;To her foster-father she said one day, &#34;If thine enemy were to pull&#10;down thine house about thy ears, and thou shouldest be sleeping in&#10;unconscious security, I would not wake thee; even if I had the&#10;power I would never do it, for my ears still tingle with the blow&#10;that thou gavest me years ago. I have never forgotten it.&#34; But the&#10;Viking treated her words as a joke; he was, like every one else,&#10;bewitched with her beauty, and knew nothing of the change in the&#10;form and temper of Helga at night. Without a saddle, she would sit&#10;on a horse as if she were a part of it, while it rushed along at&#10;full speed; nor would she spring from its back, even when it&#10;quarrelled with other horses and bit them. She would often leap&#10;from the high shore into the sea with all her clothes on, and swim&#10;to meet the Viking, when his boat was steering home towards the&#10;shore. She once cut off a long lock of her beautiful hair, and&#10;twisted it into a string for her bow. &#34;If a thing is to be done&#10;well,&#34; said she, &#34;I must do it myself.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Viking&#39;s wife was, for the time in which she lived, a&#10;woman of strong character and will; but, compared to her daughter,&#10;she was a gentle, timid woman, and she knew that a wicked sorcerer&#10;had the terrible child in his power. It was sometimes as if Helga&#10;acted from sheer wickedness; for often when her mother stood on the&#10;threshold of the door, or stepped into the yard, she would seat&#10;herself on the brink of the well, wave her arms and legs in the&#10;air, and suddenly fall right in. Here she was able, from her frog&#10;nature, to dip and dive about in the water of the deep well, until&#10;at last she would climb forth like a cat, and come back into the&#10;hall dripping with water, so that the green leaves that were&#10;strewed on the floor were whirled round, and carried away by the&#10;streams that flowed from her.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But there was one time of the day which placed a check&#10;upon Helga. It was the evening twilight; when this hour arrived she&#10;became quiet and thoughtful, and allowed herself to be advised and&#10;led; then also a secret feeling seemed to draw her towards her&#10;mother. And as usual, when the sun set, and the transformation took&#10;place, both in body and mind, inwards and outwards, she would&#10;remain quiet and mournful, with her form shrunk together in the&#10;shape of a frog. Her body was much larger than those animals ever&#10;are, and on this account it was much more hideous in appearance;&#10;for she looked like a wretched dwarf, with a frog&#39;s head, and&#10;webbed fingers. Her eyes had a most piteous expression; she was&#10;without a voice, excepting a hollow, croaking sound, like the&#10;smothered sobs of a dreaming child.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the Viking&#39;s wife took her on her lap, and forgot the&#10;ugly form, as she looked into the mournful eyes, and often said, &#34;I&#10;could wish that thou wouldst always remain my dumb frog child, for&#10;thou art too terrible when thou art clothed in a form of beauty.&#34;&#10;And the Viking woman wrote Runic characters against sorcery and&#10;spells of sickness, and threw them over the wretched child; but&#10;they did no good.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;One can scarcely believe that she was ever small enough&#10;to lie in the cup of the water-lily,&#34; said the papa stork; &#34;and now&#10;she is grown up, and the image of her Egyptian mother, especially&#10;about the eyes. Ah, we shall never see her again; perhaps she has&#10;not discovered how to help herself, as you and the wise men said&#10;she would. Year after year have I flown across and across the moor,&#10;but there was no sign of her being still alive. Yes, and I may as&#10;well tell you that you that each year, when I arrived a few days&#10;before you to repair the nest, and put everything in its place, I&#10;have spent a whole night flying here and there over the marshy&#10;lake, as if I had been an owl or a bat, but all to no purpose. The&#10;two suit of swan&#39;s plumage, which I and the young ones dragged over&#10;here from the land of the Nile, are of no use; trouble enough it&#10;was to us to bring them here in three journeys, and now they are&#10;lying at the bottom of the nest; and if a fire should happen to&#10;break out, and the wooden house be burnt down, they would be&#10;destroyed.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And our good nest would be destroyed, too,&#34; said the&#10;mamma stork; &#34;but you think less of that than of your plumage stuff&#10;and your moor-princess. Go and stay with her in the marsh if you&#10;like. You are a bad father to your own children, as I have told you&#10;already, when I hatched my first brood. I only hope neither we nor&#10;our children may have an arrow sent through our wings, owing to&#10;that wild girl. Helga does not know in the least what she is about.&#10;We have lived in this house longer than she has, she should think&#10;of that, and we have never forgotten our duty. We have paid every&#10;year our toll of a feather, an egg, and a young one, as it is only&#10;right we should do. You don&#39;t suppose I can wander about the&#10;court-yard, or go everywhere as I used to do in old times. I can do&#10;it in Egypt, where I can be a companion of the people, without&#10;forgetting myself. But here I cannot go and peep into the pots and&#10;kettles as I do there. No, I can only sit up here and feel angry&#10;with that girl, the little wretch; and I am angry with you, too;&#10;you should have left her lying in the water lily, then no one would&#10;have known anything about her.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You are far better than your conversation,&#34; said the papa&#10;stork; &#34;I know you better than you know yourself.&#34; And with that he&#10;gave a hop, and flapped his wings twice, proudly; then he stretched&#10;his neck and flew, or rather soared away, without moving his&#10;outspread wings. He went on for some distance, and then he gave a&#10;great flap with his wings and flew on his course at a rapid rate,&#10;his head and neck bending proudly before him, while the sun&#39;s rays&#10;fell on his glossy plumage.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;He is the handsomest of them all,&#34; said the mamma stork,&#10;as she watched him; &#34;but I won&#39;t tell him so.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Early in the autumn, the Viking again returned home laden&#10;with spoil, and bringing prisoners with him. Among them was a young&#10;Christian priest, one of those who contemned the gods of the north.&#10;Often lately there had been, both in hall and chamber, a talk of&#10;the new faith which was spreading far and wide in the south, and&#10;which, through the means of the holy Ansgarius, had already reached&#10;as far as Hedeby on the Schlei. Even Helga had heard of this belief&#10;in the teachings of One who was named Christ, and who for the love&#10;of mankind, and for their redemption, had given up His life. But to&#10;her all this had, as it were, gone in one ear and out the other. It&#10;seemed that she only understood the meaning of the word &#34;love,&#34;&#10;when in the form of a miserable frog she crouched together in the&#10;corner of the sleeping chamber; but the Viking&#39;s wife had listened&#10;to the wonderful story, and had felt herself strangely moved by&#10;it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;On their return, after this voyage, the men spoke of the&#10;beautiful temples built of polished stone, which had been raised&#10;for the public worship of this holy love. Some vessels, curiously&#10;formed of massive gold, had been brought home among the booty.&#10;There was a peculiar fragrance about them all, for they were&#10;incense vessels, which had been swung before the altars in the&#10;temples by the Christian priests. In the deep stony cellars of the&#10;castle, the young Christian priest was immured, and his hands and&#10;feet tied together with strips of bark. The Viking&#39;s wife&#10;considered him as beautiful as Baldur, and his distress raised her&#10;pity; but Helga said he ought to have ropes fastened to his heels,&#10;and be tied to the tails of wild animals.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I would let the dogs loose after him&#34; she said; &#34;over the&#10;moor and across the heath. Hurrah! that would be a spectacle for&#10;the gods, and better still to follow in its course.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But the Viking would not allow him to die such a death as&#10;that, especially as he was the disowned and despiser of the high&#10;gods. In a few days, he had decided to have him offered as a&#10;sacrifice on the blood-stone in the grove. For the first time, a&#10;man was to be sacrificed here. Helga begged to be allowed to&#10;sprinkle the assembled people with the blood of the priest. She&#10;sharpened her glittering knife; and when one of the great, savage&#10;dogs, who were running about the Viking&#39;s castle in great numbers,&#10;sprang towards her, she thrust the knife into his side, merely, as&#10;she said, to prove its sharpness.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Viking&#39;s wife looked at the wild, badly disposed girl,&#10;with great sorrow; and when night came on, and her daughter&#39;s&#10;beautiful form and disposition were changed, she spoke in eloquent&#10;words to Helga of the sorrow and deep grief that was in her heart.&#10;The ugly frog, in its monstrous shape, stood before her, and raised&#10;its brown mournful eyes to her face, listening to her words, and&#10;seeming to understand them with the intelligence of a human&#10;being.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Never once to my lord and husband has a word passed my&#10;lips of what I have to suffer through you; my heart is full of&#10;grief about you,&#34; said the Viking&#39;s wife. &#34;The love of a mother is&#10;greater and more powerful than I ever imagined. But love never&#10;entered thy heart; it is cold and clammy, like the plants on the&#10;moor.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the miserable form trembled; it was as if these words&#10;had touched an invisible bond between body and soul, for great&#10;tears stood in the eyes.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;A bitter time will come for thee at last,&#34; continued the&#10;Viking&#39;s wife; &#34;and it will be terrible for me too. It had been&#10;better for thee if thou hadst been left on the high-road, with the&#10;cold night wind to lull thee to sleep.&#34; And the Viking&#39;s wife shed&#10;bitter tears, and went away in anger and sorrow, passing under the&#10;partition of furs, which hung loose over the beam and divided the&#10;hall.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The shrivelled frog still sat in the corner alone. Deep&#10;silence reigned around. At intervals, a half-stifled sigh was heard&#10;from its inmost soul; it was the soul of Helga. It seemed in pain,&#10;as if a new life were arising in her heart. Then she took a step&#10;forward and listened; then stepped again forward, and seized with&#10;her clumsy hands the heavy bar which was laid across the door.&#10;Gently, and with much trouble, she pushed back the bar, as silently&#10;lifted the latch, and then took up the glimmering lamp which stood&#10;in the ante-chamber of the hall. It seemed as if a stronger will&#10;than her own gave her strength. She removed the iron bolt from the&#10;closed cellar-door, and slipped in to the prisoner. He was&#10;slumbering. She touched him with her cold, moist hand, and as he&#10;awoke and caught sight of the hideous form, he shuddered as if he&#10;beheld a wicked apparition. She drew her knife, cut through the&#10;bonds which confined his hands and feet, and beckoned to him to&#10;follow her. He uttered some holy names and made the sign of the&#10;cross, while the form remained motionless by his side.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Who art thou?&#34; he asked, &#34;whose outward appearance is&#10;that of an animal, while thou willingly performest acts of&#10;mercy?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The frog-figure beckoned to him to follow her, and led him&#10;through a long gallery concealed by hanging drapery to the stables,&#10;and then pointed to a horse. He mounted upon it, and she sprang up&#10;also before him, and held tightly by the animal&#39;s mane. The&#10;prisoner understood her, and they rode on at a rapid trot, by a&#10;road which he would never have found by himself, across the open&#10;heath. He forgot her ugly form, and only thought how the mercy and&#10;loving-kindness of the Almighty was acting through this hideous&#10;apparition. As he offered pious prayers and sang holy songs of&#10;praise, she trembled. Was it the effect of prayer and praise that&#10;caused this? or, was she shuddering in the cold morning air at the&#10;thought of approaching twilight? What were her feelings? She raised&#10;herself up, and wanted to stop the horse and spring off, but the&#10;Christian priest held her back with all his might, and then sang a&#10;pious song, as if this could loosen the wicked charm that had&#10;changed her into the semblance of a frog.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the horse galloped on more wildly than before. The sky&#10;painted itself red, the first sunbeam pierced through the clouds,&#10;and in the clear flood of sunlight the frog became changed. It was&#10;Helga again, young and beautiful, but with a wicked demoniac&#10;spirit. He held now a beautiful young woman in his arms, and he was&#10;horrified at the sight. He stopped the horse, and sprang from its&#10;back. He imagined that some new sorcery was at work. But Helga also&#10;leaped from the horse and stood on the ground. The child&#39;s short&#10;garment reached only to her knee. She snatched the sharp knife from&#10;her girdle, and rushed like lightning at the astonished priest.&#10;&#34;Let me get at thee!&#34; she cried; &#34;let me get at thee, that I may&#10;plunge this knife into thy body. Thou art pale as ashes, thou&#10;beardless slave.&#34; She pressed in upon him. They struggled with each&#10;other in heavy combat, but it was as if an invisible power had been&#10;given to the Christian in the struggle. He held her fast, and the&#10;old oak under which they stood seemed to help him, for the loosened&#10;roots on the ground became entangled in the maiden&#39;s feet, and held&#10;them fast. Close by rose a bubbling spring, and he sprinkled&#10;Helga&#39;s face and neck with the water, commanded the unclean spirit&#10;to come forth, and pronounced upon her a Christian blessing. But&#10;the water of faith has no power unless the well-spring of faith&#10;flows within. And yet even here its power was shown; something more&#10;than the mere strength of a man opposed itself, through his means,&#10;against the evil which struggled within her. His holy action seemed&#10;to overpower her. She dropped her arms, glanced at him with pale&#10;cheeks and looks of amazement. He appeared to her a mighty magician&#10;skilled in secret arts; his language was the darkest magic to her,&#10;and the movements of his hands in the air were as the secret signs&#10;of a magician&#39;s wand. She would not have blinked had he waved over&#10;her head a sharp knife or a glittering axe; but she shrunk from him&#10;as he signed her with the sign of the cross on her forehead and&#10;breast, and sat before him like a tame bird, with her head bowed&#10;down. Then he spoke to her, in gentle words, of the deed of love&#10;she had performed for him during the night, when she had come to&#10;him in the form of an ugly frog, to loosen his bonds, and to lead&#10;him forth to life and light; and he told her that she was bound in&#10;closer fetters than he had been, and that she could recover also&#10;life and light by his means. He would take her to Hedeby to St.&#10;Ansgarius, and there, in that Christian town, the spell of the&#10;sorcerer would be removed. But he would not let her sit before him&#10;on the horse, though of her own free will she wished to do so.&#10;&#34;Thou must sit behind me, not before me,&#34; said he. &#34;Thy magic&#10;beauty has a magic power which comes from an evil origin, and I&#10;fear it; still I am sure to overcome through my faith in Christ.&#34;&#10;Then he knelt down, and prayed with pious fervor. It was as if the&#10;quiet woodland were a holy church consecrated by his worship. The&#10;birds sang as if they were also of this new congregation; and the&#10;fragrance of the wild flowers was as the ambrosial perfume of&#10;incense; while, above all, sounded the words of Scripture, &#34;A light&#10;to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide&#10;their feet into the way of peace.&#34; And he spoke these words with&#10;the deep longing of his whole nature.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Meanwhile, the horse that had carried them in wild career&#10;stood quietly by, plucking at the tall bramble-bushes, till the&#10;ripe young berries fell down upon Helga&#39;s hands, as if inviting her&#10;to eat. Patiently she allowed herself to be lifted on the horse,&#10;and sat there like a somnambulist&#8212;as one who walked in his sleep.&#10;The Christian bound two branches together with bark, in the form of&#10;a cross, and held it on high as they rode through the forest. The&#10;way gradually grew thicker of brushwood, as they rode along, till&#10;at last it became a trackless wilderness. Bushes of the wild sloe&#10;here and there blocked up the path, so that they had to ride over&#10;them. The bubbling spring formed not a stream, but a marsh, round&#10;which also they were obliged to guide the horse; still there were&#10;strength and refreshment in the cool forest breeze, and no trifling&#10;power in the gentle words spoken in faith and Christian love by the&#10;young priest, whose inmost heart yearned to lead this poor lost one&#10;into the way of light and life. It is said that rain-drops can make&#10;a hollow in the hardest stone, and the waves of the sea can smooth&#10;and round the rough edges of the rocks; so did the dew of mercy&#10;fall upon Helga, softening what was hard, and smoothing what was&#10;rough in her character. These effects did not yet appear; she was&#10;not herself aware of them; neither does the seed in the lap of&#10;earth know, when the refreshing dew and the warm sunbeams fall upon&#10;it, that it contains within itself power by which it will flourish&#10;and bloom. The song of the mother sinks into the heart of the&#10;child, and the little one prattles the words after her, without&#10;understanding their meaning; but after a time the thoughts expand,&#10;and what has been heard in childhood seems to the mind clear and&#10;bright. So now the &#34;Word,&#34; which is all-powerful to create, was&#10;working in the heart of Helga.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;They rode forth from the thick forest, crossed the heath,&#10;and again entered a pathless wood. Here, towards evening, they met&#10;with robbers.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Where hast thou stolen that beauteous maiden?&#34; cried the&#10;robbers, seizing the horse by the bridle, and dragging the two&#10;riders from its back.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The priest had nothing to defend himself with, but the&#10;knife he had taken from Helga, and with this he struck out right&#10;and left. One of the robbers raised his axe against him; but the&#10;young priest sprang on one side, and avoided the blow, which fell&#10;with great force on the horse&#39;s neck, so that the blood gushed&#10;forth, and the animal sunk to the ground. Then Helga seemed&#10;suddenly to awake from her long, deep reverie; she threw herself&#10;hastily upon the dying animal. The priest placed himself before&#10;her, to defend and shelter her; but one of the robbers swung his&#10;iron axe against the Christian&#39;s head with such force that it was&#10;dashed to pieces, the blood and brains were scattered about, and he&#10;fell dead upon the ground. Then the robbers seized beautiful Helga&#10;by her white arms and slender waist; but at that moment the sun&#10;went down, and as its last ray disappeared, she was changed into&#10;the form of a frog. A greenish white mouth spread half over her&#10;face; her arms became thin and slimy; while broad hands, with&#10;webbed fingers, spread themselves out like fans. Then the robbers,&#10;in terror, let her go, and she stood among them, a hideous monster;&#10;and as is the nature of frogs to do, she hopped up as high as her&#10;own size, and disappeared in the thicket. Then the robbers knew&#10;that this must be the work of an evil spirit or some secret&#10;sorcery, and, in a terrible fright, they ran hastily from the&#10;spot.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The full moon had already risen, and was shining in all&#10;her radiant splendor over the earth, when from the thicket, in the&#10;form of a frog, crept poor Helga. She stood still by the corpse of&#10;the Christian priest, and the carcase of the dead horse. She looked&#10;at them with eyes that seemed to weep, and from the frog&#39;s head&#10;came forth a croaking sound, as when a child bursts into tears. She&#10;threw herself first upon one, and then upon the other; brought&#10;water in her hand, which, from being webbed, was large and hollow,&#10;and poured it over them; but they were dead, and dead they would&#10;remain. She understood that at last. Soon wild animals would come&#10;and tear their dead bodies; but no, that must not happen. Then she&#10;dug up the earth, as deep as she was able, that she might prepare a&#10;grave for them. She had nothing but a branch of a tree and her two&#10;hands, between the fingers of which the webbed skin stretched, and&#10;they were torn by the work, while the blood ran down her hands. She&#10;saw at last that her work would be useless, more than she could&#10;accomplish; so she fetched more water, and washed the face of the&#10;dead, and then covered it with fresh green leaves; she also brought&#10;large boughs and spread over him, and scattered dried leaves&#10;between the branches. Then she brought the heaviest stones that she&#10;could carry, and laid them over the dead body, filling up the&#10;crevices with moss, till she thought she had fenced in his&#10;resting-place strongly enough. The difficult task had employed her&#10;the whole night; and as the sun broke forth, there stood the&#10;beautiful Helga in all her loveliness, with her bleeding hands,&#10;and, for the first time, with tears on her maiden cheeks. It was,&#10;in this transformation, as if two natures were striving together&#10;within her; her whole frame trembled, and she looked around her as&#10;if she had just awoke from a painful dream. She leaned for support&#10;against the trunk of a slender tree, and at last climbed to the&#10;topmost branches, like a cat, and seated herself firmly upon them.&#10;She remained there the whole day, sitting alone, like a frightened&#10;squirrel, in the silent solitude of the wood, where the rest and&#10;stillness is as the calm of death.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Butterflies fluttered around her, and close by were&#10;several ant-hills, each with its hundreds of busy little creatures&#10;moving quickly to and fro. In the air, danced myriads of gnats,&#10;swarm upon swarm, troops of buzzing flies, ladybirds, dragon-flies&#10;with golden wings, and other little winged creatures. The worm&#10;crawled forth from the moist ground, and the moles crept out; but,&#10;excepting these, all around had the stillness of death: but when&#10;people say this, they do not quite understand themselves what they&#10;mean. None noticed Helga but a flock of magpies, which flew&#10;chattering round the top of the tree on which she sat. These birds&#10;hopped close to her on the branches with bold curiosity. A glance&#10;from her eyes was a signal to frighten them away, and they were not&#10;clever enough to find out who she was; indeed she hardly knew&#10;herself.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;When the sun was near setting, and the evening&#39;s twilight&#10;about to commence, the approaching transformation aroused her to&#10;fresh exertion. She let herself down gently from the tree, and, as&#10;the last sunbeam vanished, she stood again in the wrinkled form of&#10;a frog, with the torn, webbed skin on her hands, but her eyes now&#10;gleamed with more radiant beauty than they had ever possessed in&#10;her most beautiful form of loveliness; they were now pure, mild&#10;maidenly eyes that shone forth in the face of a frog. They showed&#10;the existence of deep feeling and a human heart, and the beauteous&#10;eyes overflowed with tears, weeping precious drops that lightened&#10;the heart.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;On the raised mound which she had made as a grave for the&#10;dead priest, she found the cross made of the branches of a tree,&#10;the last work of him who now lay dead and cold beneath it. A sudden&#10;thought came to Helga, and she lifted up the cross and planted it&#10;upon the grave, between the stones that covered him and the dead&#10;horse. The sad recollection brought the tears to her eyes, and in&#10;this gentle spirit she traced the same sign in the sand round the&#10;grave; and as she formed, with both her hands, the sign of the&#10;cross, the web skin fell from them like a torn glove. She washed&#10;her hands in the water of the spring, and gazed with astonishment&#10;at their delicate whiteness. Again she made the holy sign in the&#10;air, between herself and the dead man; her lips trembled, her&#10;tongue moved, and the name which she in her ride through the forest&#10;had so often heard spoken, rose to her lips, and she uttered the&#10;words, &#34;Jesus Christ.&#34; Then the frog skin fell from her; she was&#10;once more a lovely maiden. Her head bent wearily, her tired limbs&#10;required rest, and then she slept.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Her sleep, however, was short. Towards midnight, she&#10;awoke; before her stood the dead horse, prancing and full of life,&#10;which shone forth from his eyes and from his wounded neck. Close by&#10;his side appeared the murdered Christian priest, more beautiful&#10;than Baldur, as the Viking&#39;s wife had said; but now he came as if&#10;in a flame of fire. Such gravity, such stern justice, such a&#10;piercing glance shone from his large, gentle eyes, that it seemed&#10;to penetrate into every corner of her heart. Beautiful Helga&#10;trembled at the look, and her memory returned with a power as if it&#10;had been the day of judgment. Every good deed that had been done&#10;for her, every loving word that had been said, were vividly before&#10;her mind. She understood now that love had kept her here during the&#10;day of her trial; while the creature formed of dust and clay, soul&#10;and spirit, had wrestled and struggled with evil. She acknowledged&#10;that she had only followed the impulses of an evil disposition,&#10;that she had done nothing to cure herself; everything had been&#10;given her, and all had happened as it were by the ordination of&#10;Providence. She bowed herself humbly, confessed her great&#10;imperfections in the sight of Him who can read every fault of the&#10;heart, and then the priest spoke. &#34;Daughter of the moorland, thou&#10;hast come from the swamp and the marshy earth, but from this thou&#10;shalt arise. The sunlight shining into thy inmost soul proves the&#10;origin from which thou hast really sprung, and has restored the&#10;body to its natural form. I am come to thee from the land of the&#10;dead, and thou also must pass through the valley to reach the holy&#10;mountains where mercy and perfection dwell. I cannot lead thee to&#10;Hedeby that thou mayst receive Christian baptism, for first thou&#10;must remove the thick veil with which the waters of the moorland&#10;are shrouded, and bring forth from its depths the living author of&#10;thy being and thy life. Till this is done, thou canst not receive&#10;consecration.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then he lifted her on the horse and gave her a golden&#10;censer, similar to those she had already seen at the Viking&#39;s&#10;house. A sweet perfume arose from it, while the open wound in the&#10;forehead of the slain priest, shone with the rays of a diamond. He&#10;took the cross from the grave, and held it aloft, and now they rode&#10;through the air over the rustling trees, over the hills where&#10;warriors lay buried each by his dead war-horse; and the brazen&#10;monumental figures rose up and galloped forth, and stationed&#10;themselves on the summits of the hills. The golden crescent on&#10;their foreheads, fastened with golden knots, glittered in the&#10;moonlight, and their mantles floated in the wind. The dragon, that&#10;guards buried treasure, lifted his head and gazed after them. The&#10;goblins and the satyrs peeped out from beneath the hills, and&#10;flitted to and fro in the fields, waving blue, red, and green&#10;torches, like the glowing sparks in burning paper. Over woodland&#10;and heath, flood and fen, they flew on, till they reached the wild&#10;moor, over which they hovered in broad circles. The Christian&#10;priest held the cross aloft, and it glittered like gold, while from&#10;his lips sounded pious prayers. Beautiful Helga&#39;s voice joined with&#10;his in the hymns he sung, as a child joins in her mother&#39;s song.&#10;She swung the censer, and a wonderful fragrance of incense arose&#10;from it; so powerful, that the reeds and rushes of the moor burst&#10;forth into blossom. Each germ came forth from the deep ground: all&#10;that had life raised itself. Blooming water-lilies spread&#10;themselves forth like a carpet of wrought flowers, and upon them&#10;lay a slumbering woman, young and beautiful. Helga fancied that it&#10;was her own image she saw reflected in the still water. But it was&#10;her mother she beheld, the wife of the Marsh King, the princess&#10;from the land of the Nile.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The dead Christian priest desired that the sleeping woman&#10;should be lifted on the horse, but the horse sank beneath the load,&#10;as if he had been a funeral pall fluttering in the wind. But the&#10;sign of the cross made the airy phantom strong, and then the three&#10;rode away from the marsh to firm ground.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;At the same moment the cock crew in the Viking&#39;s castle,&#10;and the dream figures dissolved and floated away in the air, but&#10;mother and daughter stood opposite to each other.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Am I looking at my own image in the deep water?&#34; said the&#10;mother.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Is it myself that I see represented on a white shield?&#34;&#10;cried the daughter.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then they came nearer to each other in a fond embrace. The&#10;mother&#39;s heart beat quickly, and she understood the quickened&#10;pulses. &#34;My child!&#34; she exclaimed, &#34;the flower of my heart&#8212;my lotus&#10;flower of the deep water!&#34; and she embraced her child again and&#10;wept, and the tears were as a baptism of new life and love for&#10;Helga. &#34;In swan&#39;s plumage I came here,&#34; said the mother, &#34;and here&#10;I threw off my feather dress. Then I sank down through the wavering&#10;ground, deep into the marsh beneath, which closed like a wall&#10;around me; I found myself after a while in fresher water; still a&#10;power drew me down deeper and deeper. I felt the weight of sleep&#10;upon my eyelids. Then I slept, and dreams hovered round me. It&#10;seemed to me as if I were again in the pyramids of Egypt, and yet&#10;the waving elder trunk that had frightened me on the moor stood&#10;ever before me. I observed the clefts and wrinkles in the stem;&#10;they shone forth in strange colors, and took the form of&#10;hieroglyphics. It was the mummy case on which I gazed. At last it&#10;burst, and forth stepped the thousand years&#39; old king, the mummy&#10;form, black as pitch, black as the shining wood-snail, or the slimy&#10;mud of the swamp. Whether it was really the mummy or the Marsh King&#10;I know not. He seized me in his arms, and I felt as if I must die.&#10;When I recovered myself, I found in my bosom a little bird,&#10;flapping its wings, twittering and fluttering. The bird flew away&#10;from my bosom, upwards towards the dark, heavy canopy above me, but&#10;a long, green band kept it fastened to me. I heard and understood&#10;the tenor of its longings. Freedom! sunlight! to my father! Then I&#10;thought of my father, and the sunny land of my birth, my life, and&#10;my love. Then I loosened the band, and let the bird fly away to its&#10;home&#8212;to a father. Since that hour I have ceased to dream; my sleep&#10;has been long and heavy, till in this very hour, harmony and&#10;fragrance awoke me, and set me free.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The green band which fastened the wings of the bird to the&#10;mother&#39;s heart, where did it flutter now? whither had it been&#10;wafted? The stork only had seen it. The band was the green stalk,&#10;the cup of the flower the cradle in which lay the child, that now&#10;in blooming beauty had been folded to the mother&#39;s&#10;heart.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And while the two were resting in each other&#39;s arms, the&#10;old stork flew round and round them in narrowing circles, till at&#10;length he flew away swiftly to his nest, and fetched away the two&#10;suits of swan&#39;s feathers, which he had preserved there for many&#10;years. Then he returned to the mother and daughter, and threw the&#10;swan&#39;s plumage over them; the feathers immediately closed around&#10;them, and they rose up from the earth in the form of two white&#10;swans.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And now we can converse with pleasure,&#34; said the&#10;stork-papa; &#34;we can understand one another, although the beaks of&#10;birds are so different in shape. It is very fortunate that you came&#10;to-night. To-morrow we should have been gone. The mother, myself&#10;and the little ones, we&#39;re about to fly to the south. Look at me&#10;now: I am an old friend from the Nile, and a mother&#39;s heart&#10;contains more than her beak. She always said that the princess&#10;would know how to help herself. I and the young ones carried the&#10;swan&#39;s feathers over here, and I am glad of it now, and how lucky&#10;it is that I am here still. When the day dawns we shall start with&#10;a great company of other storks. We&#39;ll fly first, and you can&#10;follow in our track, so that you cannot miss your way. I and the&#10;young ones will have an eye upon you.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And the lotus-flower which I was to take with me,&#34; said&#10;the Egyptian princess, &#34;is flying here by my side, clothed in&#10;swan&#39;s feathers. The flower of my heart will travel with me; and so&#10;the riddle is solved. Now for home! now for home!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But Helga said she could not leave the Danish land without&#10;once more seeing her foster-mother, the loving wife of the Viking.&#10;Each pleasing recollection, each kind word, every tear from the&#10;heart which her foster-mother had wept for her, rose in her mind,&#10;and at that moment she felt as if she loved this mother the&#10;best.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, we must go to the Viking&#39;s castle,&#34; said the stork;&#10;&#34;mother and the young ones are waiting for me there. How they will&#10;open their eyes and flap their wings! My wife, you see, does not&#10;say much; she is short and abrupt in her manner; but she means&#10;well, for all that. I will flap my wings at once, that they may&#10;hear us coming.&#34; Then stork-papa flapped his wings in first-rate&#10;style, and he and the swans flew away to the Viking&#39;s&#10;castle.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the castle, every one was in a deep sleep. It had been&#10;late in the evening before the Viking&#39;s wife retired to rest. She&#10;was anxious about Helga, who, three days before, had vanished with&#10;the Christian priest. Helga must have helped him in his flight, for&#10;it was her horse that was missed from the stable; but by what power&#10;had all this been accomplished? The Viking&#39;s wife thought of it&#10;with wonder, thought on the miracles which they said could be&#10;performed by those who believed in the Christian faith, and&#10;followed its teachings. These passing thoughts formed themselves&#10;into a vivid dream, and it seemed to her that she was still lying&#10;awake on her couch, while without darkness reigned. A storm arose;&#10;she heard the lake dashing and rolling from east and west, like the&#10;waves of the North Sea or the Cattegat. The monstrous snake which,&#10;it is said, surrounds the earth in the depths of the ocean, was&#10;trembling in spasmodic convulsions. The night of the fall of the&#10;gods was come, &#34;Ragnorock,&#34; as the heathens call the judgment-day,&#10;when everything shall pass away, even the high gods themselves. The&#10;war trumpet sounded; riding upon the rainbow, came the gods, clad&#10;in steel, to fight their last battle on the last battle-field.&#10;Before them flew the winged vampires, and the dead warriors closed&#10;up the train. The whole firmament was ablaze with the northern&#10;lights, and yet the darkness triumphed. It was a terrible hour.&#10;And, close to the terrified woman, Helga seemed to be seated on the&#10;floor, in the hideous form of a frog, yet trembling, and clinging&#10;to her foster-mother, who took her on her lap, and lovingly&#10;caressed her, hideous and frog-like as she was. The air was filled&#10;with the clashing of arms and the hissing of arrows, as if a storm&#10;of hail was descending upon the earth. It seemed to her the hour&#10;when earth and sky would burst asunder, and all things be swallowed&#10;up in Saturn&#39;s fiery lake; but she knew that a new heaven and a new&#10;earth would arise, and that corn-fields would wave where now the&#10;lake rolled over desolate sands, and the ineffable God reign. Then&#10;she saw rising from the region of the dead, Baldur the gentle, the&#10;loving, and as the Viking&#39;s wife gazed upon him, she recognized his&#10;countenance. It was the captive Christian priest. &#34;White&#10;Christian!&#34; she exclaimed aloud, and with the words, she pressed a&#10;kiss on the forehead of the hideous frog-child. Then the frog-skin&#10;fell off, and Helga stood before her in all her beauty, more lovely&#10;and gentle-looking, and with eyes beaming with love. She kissed the&#10;hands of her foster-mother, blessed her for all her fostering love&#10;and care during the days of her trial and misery, for the thoughts&#10;she had suggested and awoke in her heart, and for naming the Name&#10;which she now repeated. Then beautiful Helga rose as a mighty swan,&#10;and spread her wings with the rushing sound of troops of birds of&#10;passage flying through the air.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the Viking&#39;s wife awoke, but she still heard the&#10;rushing sound without. She knew it was the time for the storks to&#10;depart, and that it must be their wings which she heard. She felt&#10;she should like to see them once more, and bid them farewell. She&#10;rose from her couch, stepped out on the threshold, and beheld, on&#10;the ridge of the roof, a party of storks ranged side by side.&#10;Troops of the birds were flying in circles over the castle and the&#10;highest trees; but just before her, as she stood on the threshold&#10;and close to the well where Helga had so often sat and alarmed her&#10;with her wildness, now stood two swans, gazing at her with&#10;intelligent eyes. Then she remembered her dream, which still&#10;appeared to her as a reality. She thought of Helga in the form of a&#10;swan. She thought of a Christian priest, and suddenly a wonderful&#10;joy arose in her heart. The swans flapped their wings and arched&#10;their necks as if to offer her a greeting, and the Viking&#39;s wife&#10;spread out her arms towards them, as if she accepted it, and smiled&#10;through her tears. She was roused from deep thought by a rustling&#10;of wings and snapping of beaks; all the storks arose, and started&#10;on their journey towards the south.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;We will not wait for the swans,&#34; said the mamma stork;&#10;&#34;if they want to go with us, let them come now; we can&#39;t sit here&#10;till the plovers start. It is a fine thing after all to travel in&#10;families, not like the finches and the partridges. There the male&#10;and the female birds fly in separate flocks, which, to speak&#10;candidly, I consider very unbecoming.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What are those swans flapping their wings&#10;for?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Well, every one flies in his own fashion,&#34; said the papa&#10;stork. &#34;The swans fly in an oblique line; the cranes, in the form&#10;of a triangle; and the plovers, in a curved line like a&#10;snake.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Don&#39;t talk about snakes while we are flying up here,&#34;&#10;said stork-mamma. &#34;It puts ideas into the children&#39;s heads that can&#10;not be realized.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Are those the high mountains I have heard spoken of?&#34;&#10;asked Helga, in the swan&#39;s plumage.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;They are storm-clouds driving along beneath us,&#34; replied&#10;her mother.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What are yonder white clouds that rise so high?&#34; again&#10;inquired Helga.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Those are mountains covered with perpetual snows, that&#10;you see yonder,&#34; said her mother. And then they flew across the&#10;Alps towards the blue Mediterranean.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Africa&#39;s land! Egyptia&#39;s strand!&#34; sang the daughter of&#10;the Nile, in her swan&#39;s plumage, as from the upper air she caught&#10;sight of her native land, a narrow, golden, wavy strip on the&#10;shores of the Nile; the other birds espied it also and hastened&#10;their flight.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I can smell the Nile mud and the wet frogs,&#34; said the&#10;stork-mamma, &#34;and I begin to feel quite hungry. Yes, now you shall&#10;taste something nice, and you will see the marabout bird, and the&#10;ibis, and the crane. They all belong to our family, but they are&#10;not nearly so handsome as we are. They give themselves great airs,&#10;especially the ibis. The Egyptians have spoilt him. They make a&#10;mummy of him, and stuff him with spices. I would rather be stuffed&#10;with live frogs, and so would you, and so you shall. Better have&#10;something in your inside while you are alive, than to be made a&#10;parade of after you are dead. That is my opinion, and I am always&#10;right.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The storks are come,&#34; was said in the great house on the&#10;banks of the Nile, where the lord lay in the hall on his downy&#10;cushions, covered with a leopard skin, scarcely alive, yet not&#10;dead, waiting and hoping for the lotus-flower from the deep&#10;moorland in the far north. Relatives and servants were standing by&#10;his couch, when the two beautiful swans who had come with the&#10;storks flew into the hall. They threw off their soft white plumage,&#10;and two lovely female forms approached the pale, sick old man, and&#10;threw back their long hair, and when Helga bent over her&#10;grandfather, redness came back to his cheeks, his eyes brightened,&#10;and life returned to his benumbed limbs. The old man rose up with&#10;health and energy renewed; daughter and grandchild welcomed him as&#10;joyfully as if with a morning greeting after a long and troubled&#10;dream.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Joy reigned through the whole house, as well as in the&#10;stork&#39;s nest; although there the chief cause was really the good&#10;food, especially the quantities of frogs, which seemed to spring&#10;out of the ground in swarms.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the learned men hastened to note down, in flying&#10;characters, the story of the two princesses, and spoke of the&#10;arrival of the health-giving flower as a mighty event, which had&#10;been a blessing to the house and the land. Meanwhile, the&#10;stork-papa told the story to his family in his own way; but not&#10;till they had eaten and were satisfied; otherwise they would have&#10;had something else to do than to listen to stories.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Well,&#34; said the stork-mamma, when she had heard it, &#34;you&#10;will be made something of at last; I suppose they can do nothing&#10;less.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What could I be made?&#34; said stork-papa; &#34;what have I&#10;done?&#8212;just nothing.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You have done more than all the rest,&#34; she replied. &#34;But&#10;for you and the youngsters the two young princesses would never&#10;have seen Egypt again, and the recovery of the old man would not&#10;have been effected. You will become something. They must certainly&#10;give you a doctor&#39;s hood, and our young ones will inherit it, and&#10;their children after them, and so on. You already look like an&#10;Egyptian doctor, at least in my eyes.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I cannot quite remember the words I heard when I listened&#10;on the roof,&#34; said stork-papa, while relating the story to his&#10;family; &#34;all I know is, that what the wise men said was so&#10;complicated and so learned, that they received not only rank, but&#10;presents; even the head cook at the great house was honored with a&#10;mark of distinction, most likely for the soup.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And what did you receive?&#34; said the stork-mamma. &#34;They&#10;certainly ought not to forget the most important person in the&#10;affair, as you really are. The learned men have done nothing at all&#10;but use their tongues. Surely they will not overlook&#10;you.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Late in the night, while the gentle sleep of peace rested&#10;on the now happy house, there was still one watcher. It was not&#10;stork-papa, who, although he stood on guard on one leg, could sleep&#10;soundly. Helga alone was awake. She leaned over the balcony, gazing&#10;at the sparkling stars that shone clearer and brighter in the pure&#10;air than they had done in the north, and yet they were the same&#10;stars. She thought of the Viking&#39;s wife in the wild moorland, of&#10;the gentle eyes of her foster-mother, and of the tears she had shed&#10;over the poor frog-child that now lived in splendor and starry&#10;beauty by the waters of the Nile, with air balmy and sweet as&#10;spring. She thought of the love that dwelt in the breast of the&#10;heathen woman, love that had been shown to a wretched creature,&#10;hateful as a human being, and hideous when in the form of an&#10;animal. She looked at the glittering stars, and thought of the&#10;radiance that had shone forth on the forehead of the dead man, as&#10;she had fled with him over the woodland and moor. Tones were&#10;awakened in her memory; words which she had heard him speak as they&#10;rode onward, when she was carried, wondering and trembling, through&#10;the air; words from the great Fountain of love, the highest love&#10;that embraces all the human race. What had not been won and&#10;achieved by this love?&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Day and night beautiful Helga was absorbed in the&#10;contemplation of the great amount of her happiness, and lost&#10;herself in the contemplation, like a child who turns hurriedly from&#10;the giver to examine the beautiful gifts. She was over-powered with&#10;her good fortune, which seemed always increasing, and therefore&#10;what might it become in the future? Had she not been brought by a&#10;wonderful miracle to all this joy and happiness? And in these&#10;thoughts she indulged, until at last she thought no more of the&#10;Giver. It was the over-abundance of youthful spirits unfolding its&#10;wings for a daring flight. Her eyes sparkled with energy, when&#10;suddenly arose a loud noise in the court below, and the daring&#10;thought vanished. She looked down, and saw two large ostriches&#10;running round quickly in narrow circles; she had never seen these&#10;creatures before,&#8212;great, coarse, clumsy-looking birds with curious&#10;wings that looked as if they had been clipped, and the birds&#10;themselves had the appearance of having been roughly used. She&#10;inquired about them, and for the first time heard the legend which&#10;the Egyptians relate respecting the ostrich.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Once, say they, the ostriches were a beautiful and&#10;glorious race of birds, with large, strong wings. One evening the&#10;other large birds of the forest said to the ostrich, &#34;Brother,&#10;shall we fly to the river to-morrow morning to drink, God willing?&#34;&#10;and the ostrich answered, &#34;I will.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;With the break of day, therefore, they commenced their&#10;flight; first rising high in the air, towards the sun, which is the&#10;eye of God; still higher and higher the ostrich flew, far above the&#10;other birds, proudly approaching the light, trusting in its own&#10;strength, and thinking not of the Giver, or saying, &#34;if God will.&#34;&#10;When suddenly the avenging angel drew back the veil from the&#10;flaming ocean of sunlight, and in a moment the wings of the proud&#10;bird were scorched and shrivelled, and they sunk miserably to the&#10;earth. Since that time the ostrich and his race have never been&#10;able to rise in the air; they can only fly terror-stricken along&#10;the ground, or run round and round in narrow circles. It is a&#10;warning to mankind, that in all our thoughts and schemes, and in&#10;every action we undertake, we should say, &#34;if God will.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then Helga bowed her head thoughtfully and seriously, and&#10;looked at the circling ostrich, as with timid fear and simple&#10;pleasure it glanced at its own great shadow on the sunlit walls.&#10;And the story of the ostrich sunk deeply into the heart and mind of&#10;Helga: a life of happiness, both in the present and in the future,&#10;seemed secure for her, and what was yet to come might be the best&#10;of all, God willing.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Early in the spring, when the storks were again about to&#10;journey northward, beautiful Helga took off her golden bracelets,&#10;scratched her name on them, and beckoned to the stork-father. He&#10;came to her, and she placed the golden circlet round his neck, and&#10;begged him to deliver it safely to the Viking&#39;s wife, so that she&#10;might know that her foster-daughter still lived, was happy, and had&#10;not forgotten her.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It is rather heavy to carry,&#34; thought stork-papa, when he&#10;had it on his neck; &#34;but gold and honor are not to be flung into&#10;the street. The stork brings good fortune&#8212;they&#39;ll be obliged to&#10;acknowledge that at last.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You lay gold, and I lay eggs,&#34; said stork-mamma; &#34;with&#10;you it is only once in a way, I lay eggs every year But no one&#10;appreciates what we do; I call it very mortifying.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But then we have a consciousness of our own worth,&#10;mother,&#34; replied stork-papa.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What good will that do you?&#34; retorted stork-mamma; &#34;it&#10;will neither bring you a fair wind, nor a good meal.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The little nightingale, who is singing yonder in the&#10;tamarind grove, will soon be going north, too.&#34; Helga said she had&#10;often heard her singing on the wild moor, so she determined to send&#10;a message by her. While flying in the swan&#39;s plumage she had learnt&#10;the bird language; she had often conversed with the stork and the&#10;swallow, and she knew that the nightingale would understand. So she&#10;begged the nightingale to fly to the beechwood, on the peninsula of&#10;Jutland, where a mound of stone and twigs had been raised to form&#10;the grave, and she begged the nightingale to persuade all the other&#10;little birds to build their nests round the place, so that evermore&#10;should resound over that grave music and song. And the nightingale&#10;flew away, and time flew away also.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the autumn, an eagle, standing upon a pyramid, saw a&#10;stately train of richly laden camels, and men attired in armor on&#10;foaming Arabian steeds, whose glossy skins shone like silver, their&#10;nostrils were pink, and their thick, flowing manes hung almost to&#10;their slender legs. A royal prince of Arabia, handsome as a prince&#10;should be, and accompanied by distinguished guests, was on his way&#10;to the stately house, on the roof of which the storks&#39; empty nests&#10;might be seen. They were away now in the far north, but expected to&#10;return very soon. And, indeed, they returned on a day that was rich&#10;in joy and gladness.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A marriage was being celebrated, in which the beautiful&#10;Helga, glittering in silk and jewels, was the bride, and the&#10;bridegroom the young Arab prince. Bride and bridegroom sat at the&#10;upper end of the table, between the bride&#39;s mother and grandfather.&#10;But her gaze was not on the bridegroom, with his manly, sunburnt&#10;face, round which curled a black beard, and whose dark fiery eyes&#10;were fixed upon her; but away from him, at a twinkling star, that&#10;shone down upon her from the sky. Then was heard the sound of&#10;rushing wings beating the air. The storks were coming home; and the&#10;old stork pair, although tired with the journey and requiring rest,&#10;did not fail to fly down at once to the balustrades of the&#10;verandah, for they knew already what feast was being celebrated.&#10;They had heard of it on the borders of the land, and also that&#10;Helga had caused their figures to be represented on the walls, for&#10;they belonged to her history.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I call that very sensible and pretty,&#34; said&#10;stork-papa.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, but it is very little,&#34; said mamma stork; &#34;they&#10;could not possibly have done less.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But, when Helga saw them, she rose and went out into the&#10;verandah to stroke the backs of the storks. The old stork pair&#10;bowed their heads, and curved their necks, and even the youngest&#10;among the young ones felt honored by this reception.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Helga continued to gaze upon the glittering star, which&#10;seemed to glow brighter and purer in its light; then between&#10;herself and the star floated a form, purer than the air, and&#10;visible through it. It floated quite near to her, and she saw that&#10;it was the dead Christian priest, who also was coming to her&#10;wedding feast&#8212;coming from the heavenly kingdom.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The glory and brightness, yonder, outshines all that is&#10;known on earth,&#34; said he.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then Helga the fair prayed more gently, and more&#10;earnestly, than she had ever prayed in her life before, that she&#10;might be permitted to gaze, if only for a single moment, at the&#10;glory and brightness of the heavenly kingdom. Then she felt herself&#10;lifted up, as it were, above the earth, through a sea of sound and&#10;thought; not only around her, but within her, was there light and&#10;song, such as words cannot express.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Now we must return;&#34; he said; &#34;you will be&#10;missed.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Only one more look,&#34; she begged; &#34;but one short moment&#10;more.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;We must return to earth; the guests will have all&#10;departed. Only one more look!&#8212;the last!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then Helga stood again in the verandah. But the marriage&#10;lamps in the festive hall had been all extinguished, and the&#10;torches outside had vanished. The storks were gone; not a guest&#10;could be seen; no bridegroom&#8212;all in those few short moments seemed&#10;to have died. Then a great dread fell upon her. She stepped from&#10;the verandah through the empty hall into the next chamber, where&#10;slept strange warriors. She opened a side door, which once led into&#10;her own apartment, but now, as she passed through, she found&#10;herself suddenly in a garden which she had never before seen here,&#10;the sky blushed red, it was the dawn of morning. Three minutes only&#10;in heaven, and a whole night on earth had passed away! Then she saw&#10;the storks, and called to them in their own language.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then stork-papa turned his head towards here, listened to&#10;her words, and drew near. &#34;You speak our language,&#34; said he, &#34;what&#10;do you wish? Why do you appear,&#8212;you&#8212;a strange woman?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It is I&#8212;it is Helga! Dost thou not know me? Three minutes&#10;ago we were speaking together yonder in the verandah.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That is a mistake,&#34; said the stork, &#34;you must have&#10;dreamed all this.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No, no,&#34; she exclaimed. Then she reminded him of the&#10;Viking&#39;s castle, of the great lake, and of the journey across the&#10;ocean.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then stork-papa winked his eyes, and said, &#34;Why that&#39;s an&#10;old story which happened in the time of my grandfather. There&#10;certainly was a princess of that kind here in Egypt once, who came&#10;from the Danish land, but she vanished on the evening of her&#10;wedding day, many hundred years ago, and never came back. You may&#10;read about it yourself yonder, on a monument in the garden. There&#10;you will find swans and storks sculptured, and on the top is a&#10;figure of the princess Helga, in marble.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And so it was; Helga understood it all now, and sank on&#10;her knees. The sun burst forth in all its glory, and, as in olden&#10;times, the form of the frog vanished in his beams, and the&#10;beautiful form stood forth in all its loveliness; so now, bathed in&#10;light, rose a beautiful form, purer, clearer than air&#8212;a ray of&#10;brightness&#8212;from the Source of light Himself. The body crumbled into&#10;dust, and a faded lotus-flower lay on the spot on which Helga had&#10;stood.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Now that is a new ending to the story,&#34; said stork-papa;&#10;&#34;I really never expected it would end in this way, but it seems a&#10;very good ending.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And what will the young ones say to it, I wonder?&#34; said&#10;stork-mamma.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ah, that is a very important question,&#34; replied the&#10;stork. &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode(''), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;IN the city of Florence, not far from the Piazza del&#10;Granduca, runs a little street called Porta Rosa. In this street,&#10;just in front of the market-place where vegetables are sold, stands&#10;a pig, made of brass and curiously formed. The bright color has&#10;been changed by age to dark green; but clear, fresh water pours&#10;from the snout, which shines as if it had been polished, and so&#10;indeed it has, for hundreds of poor people and children seize it in&#10;their hands as they place their mouths close to the mouth of the&#10;animal, to drink. It is quite a picture to see a half-naked boy&#10;clasping the well-formed creature by the head, as he presses his&#10;rosy lips against its jaws. Every one who visits Florence can very&#10;quickly find the place; he has only to ask the first beggar he&#10;meets for the Metal Pig, and he will be told where it&#10;is.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was late on a winter evening; the mountains were&#10;covered with snow, but the moon shone brightly, and moonlight in&#10;Italy is like a dull winter&#39;s day in the north; indeed it is&#10;better, for clear air seems to raise us above the earth, while in&#10;the north a cold, gray, leaden sky appears to press us down to&#10;earth, even as the cold damp earth shall one day press on us in the&#10;grave. In the garden of the grand duke&#39;s palace, under the roof of&#10;one of the wings, where a thousand roses bloom in winter, a little&#10;ragged boy had been sitting the whole day long; a boy, who might&#10;serve as a type of Italy, lovely and smiling, and yet still&#10;suffering. He was hungry and thirsty, yet no one gave him anything;&#10;and when it became dark, and they were about to close the gardens,&#10;the porter turned him out. He stood a long time musing on the&#10;bridge which crosses the Arno, and looking at the glittering stars,&#10;reflected in the water which flowed between him and the elegant&#10;marble bridge Della Trinita. He then walked away towards the Metal&#10;Pig, half knelt down, clasped it with his arms, and then put his&#10;mouth to the shining snout and drank deep draughts of the fresh&#10;water. Close by, lay a few salad-leaves and two chestnuts, which&#10;were to serve for his supper. No one was in the street but himself;&#10;it belonged only to him, so he boldly seated himself on the pig&#39;s&#10;back, leaned forward so that his curly head could rest on the head&#10;of the animal, and, before he was aware, he fell asleep.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was midnight. The Metal Pig raised himself gently, and&#10;the boy heard him say quite distinctly, &#34;Hold tight, little boy,&#10;for I am going to run;&#34; and away he started for a most wonderful&#10;ride. First, they arrived at the Piazza del Granduca, and the metal&#10;horse which bears the duke&#39;s statue, neighed aloud. The painted&#10;coats-of-arms on the old council-house shone like transparent&#10;pictures, and Michael Angelo&#39;s David tossed his sling; it was as if&#10;everything had life. The metallic groups of figures, among which&#10;were Perseus and the Rape of the Sabines, looked like living&#10;persons, and cries of terror sounded from them all across the noble&#10;square. By the Palazzo degli Uffizi, in the arcade, where the&#10;nobility assemble for the carnival, the Metal Pig stopped. &#34;Hold&#10;fast,&#34; said the animal; &#34;hold fast, for I am going up&#10;stairs.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The little boy said not a word; he was half pleased and&#10;half afraid. They entered a long gallery, where the boy had been&#10;before. The walls were resplendent with paintings; here stood&#10;statues and busts, all in a clear light as if it were day. But the&#10;grandest appeared when the door of a side room opened; the little&#10;boy could remember what beautiful things he had seen there, but&#10;to-night everything shone in its brightest colors. Here stood the&#10;figure of a beautiful woman, as beautifully sculptured as possible&#10;by one of the great masters. Her graceful limbs appeared to move;&#10;dolphins sprang at her feet, and immortality shone from her eyes.&#10;The world called her the Venus de&#39; Medici. By her side were&#10;statues, in which the spirit of life breathed in stone; figures of&#10;men, one of whom whetted his sword, and was named the Grinder;&#10;wrestling gladiators formed another group, the sword had been&#10;sharpened for them, and they strove for the goddess of beauty. The&#10;boy was dazzled by so much glitter; for the walls were gleaming&#10;with bright colors, all appeared living reality.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;As they passed from hall to hall, beauty everywhere showed&#10;itself; and as the Metal Pig went step by step from one picture to&#10;the other, the little boy could see it all plainly. One glory&#10;eclipsed another; yet there was one picture that fixed itself on&#10;the little boy&#39;s memory, more especially because of the happy&#10;children it represented, for these the little boy had seen in&#10;daylight. Many pass this picture by with indifference, and yet it&#10;contains a treasure of poetic feeling; it represents Christ&#10;descending into Hades. They are not the lost whom the spectator&#10;sees, but the heathen of olden times. The Florentine, Angiolo&#10;Bronzino, painted this picture; most beautiful is the expression on&#10;the face of the two children, who appear to have full confidence&#10;that they shall reach heaven at last. They are embracing each&#10;other, and one little one stretches out his hand towards another&#10;who stands below him, and points to himself, as if he were saying,&#10;&#34;I am going to heaven.&#34; The older people stand as if uncertain, yet&#10;hopeful, and they bow in humble adoration to the Lord Jesus. On&#10;this picture the boy&#39;s eyes rested longer than on any other: the&#10;Metal Pig stood still before it. A low sigh was heard. Did it come&#10;from the picture or from the animal? The boy raised his hands&#10;towards the smiling children, and then the Pig ran off with him&#10;through the open vestibule.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Thank you, thank you, you beautiful animal,&#34; said the&#10;little boy, caressing the Metal Pig as it ran down the&#10;steps.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Thanks to yourself also,&#34; replied the Metal Pig; &#34;I have&#10;helped you and you have helped me, for it is only when I have an&#10;innocent child on my back that I receive the power to run. Yes; as&#10;you see, I can even venture under the rays of the lamp, in front of&#10;the picture of the Madonna, but I may not enter the church; still&#10;from without, and while you are upon my back, I may look in through&#10;the open door. Do not get down yet, for if you do, then I shall be&#10;lifeless, as you have seen me in the Porta Rosa.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I will stay with you, my dear creature,&#34; said the little&#10;boy. So then they went on at a rapid pace through the streets of&#10;Florence, till they came to the square before the church of Santa&#10;Croce. The folding-doors flew open, and light streamed from the&#10;altar through the church into the deserted square. A wonderful&#10;blaze of light streamed from one of the monuments in the left-side&#10;aisle, and a thousand moving stars seemed to form a glory round it;&#10;even the coat-of-arms on the tomb-stone shone, and a red ladder on&#10;a blue field gleamed like fire. It was the grave of Galileo. The&#10;monument is unadorned, but the red ladder is an emblem of art,&#10;signifying that the way to glory leads up a shining ladder, on&#10;which the prophets of mind rise to heaven, like Elias of old. In&#10;the right aisle of the church every statue on the richly carved&#10;sarcophagi seemed endowed with life. Here stood Michael Angelo;&#10;there Dante, with the laurel wreath round his brow; Alfieri and&#10;Machiavelli; for here side by side rest the great men&#8212;the pride of&#10;Italy. The church itself is very beautiful, even more beautiful&#10;than the marble cathedral at Florence, though not so large. It&#10;seemed as if the carved vestments stirred, and as if the marble&#10;figures they covered raised their heads higher, to gaze upon the&#10;brightly colored glowing altar where the white-robed boys swung the&#10;golden censers, amid music and song, while the strong fragrance of&#10;incense filled the church, and streamed forth into the square. The&#10;boy stretched forth his hands towards the light, and at the same&#10;moment the Metal Pig started again so rapidly that he was obliged&#10;to cling tightly to him. The wind whistled in his ears, he heard&#10;the church door creak on its hinges as it closed, and it seemed to&#10;him as if he had lost his senses&#8212;then a cold shudder passed over&#10;him, and he awoke.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was morning; the Metal Pig stood in its old place on&#10;the Porta Rosa, and the boy found he had slipped nearly off its&#10;back. Fear and trembling came upon him as he thought of his mother;&#10;she had sent him out the day before to get some money, he had not&#10;done so, and now he was hungry and thirsty. Once more he clasped&#10;the neck of his metal horse, kissed its nose, and nodded farewell&#10;to it. Then he wandered away into one of the narrowest streets,&#10;where there was scarcely room for a loaded donkey to pass. A great&#10;iron-bound door stood ajar; he passed through, and climbed up a&#10;brick staircase, with dirty walls and a rope for a balustrade, till&#10;he came to an open gallery hung with rags. From here a flight of&#10;steps led down to a court, where from a well water was drawn up by&#10;iron rollers to the different stories of the house, and where the&#10;water-buckets hung side by side. Sometimes the roller and the&#10;bucket danced in the air, splashing the water all over the court.&#10;Another broken-down staircase led from the gallery, and two Russian&#10;sailors running down it almost upset the poor boy. They were coming&#10;from their nightly carousal. A woman not very young, with an&#10;unpleasant face and a quantity of black hair, followed them. &#34;What&#10;have you brought home?&#34; she asked. when she saw the boy.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Don&#39;t be angry,&#34; he pleaded; &#34;I received nothing, I have&#10;nothing at all;&#34; and he seized his mother&#39;s dress and would have&#10;kissed it. Then they went into a little room. I need not describe&#10;it, but only say that there stood in it an earthen pot with&#10;handles, made for holding fire, which in Italy is called a marito.&#10;This pot she took in her lap, warmed her fingers, and pushed the&#10;boy with her elbow.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Certainly you must have some money,&#34; she said. The boy&#10;began to cry, and then she struck him with her foot till he cried&#10;out louder.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Will you be quiet? or I&#39;ll break your screaming head;&#34;&#10;and she swung about the fire-pot which she held in her hand, while&#10;the boy crouched to the earth and screamed.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then a neighbor came in, and she had also a marito under&#10;her arm. &#34;Felicita,&#34; she said, &#34;what are you doing to the&#10;child?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The child is mine,&#34; she answered; &#34;I can murder him if I&#10;like, and you too, Giannina.&#34; And then she swung about the&#10;fire-pot. The other woman lifted up hers to defend herself, and the&#10;two pots clashed together so violently that they were dashed to&#10;pieces, and fire and ashes flew about the room. The boy rushed out&#10;at the sight, sped across the courtyard, and fled from the house.&#10;The poor child ran till he was quite out of breath; at last he&#10;stopped at the church, the doors of which were opened to him the&#10;night before, and went in. Here everything was bright, and the boy&#10;knelt down by the first tomb on his right, the grave of Michael&#10;Angelo, and sobbed as if his heart would break. People came and&#10;went, mass was performed, but no one noticed the boy, excepting an&#10;elderly citizen, who stood still and looked at him for a moment,&#10;and then went away like the rest. Hunger and thirst overpowered the&#10;child, and he became quite faint and ill. At last he crept into a&#10;corner behind the marble monuments, and went to sleep. Towards&#10;evening he was awakened by a pull at his sleeve; he started up, and&#10;the same old citizen stood before him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Are you ill? where do you live? have you been here all&#10;day?&#34; were some of the questions asked by the old man. After&#10;hearing his answers, the old man took him home to a small house&#10;close by, in a back street. They entered a glovemaker&#39;s shop, where&#10;a woman sat sewing busily. A little white poodle, so closely shaven&#10;that his pink skin could plainly be seen, frisked about the room,&#10;and gambolled upon the boy.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Innocent souls are soon intimate,&#34; said the woman, as she&#10;caressed both the boy and the dog. These good people gave the child&#10;food and drink, and said he should stay with them all night, and&#10;that the next day the old man, who was called Giuseppe, would go&#10;and speak to his mother. A little homely bed was prepared for him,&#10;but to him who had so often slept on the hard stones it was a royal&#10;couch, and he slept sweetly and dreamed of the splendid pictures&#10;and of the Metal Pig. Giuseppe went out the next morning, and the&#10;poor child was not glad to see him go, for he knew that the old man&#10;was gone to his mother, and that, perhaps, he would have to go&#10;back. He wept at the thought, and then he played with the little,&#10;lively dog, and kissed it, while the old woman looked kindly at him&#10;to encourage him. And what news did Giuseppe bring back? At first&#10;the boy could not hear, for he talked a great deal to his wife, and&#10;she nodded and stroked the boy&#39;s cheek.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then she said, &#34;He is a good lad, he shall stay with us,&#10;he may become a clever glovemaker, like you. Look what delicate&#10;fingers he has got; Madonna intended him for a glovemaker.&#34; So the&#10;boy stayed with them, and the woman herself taught him to sew; and&#10;he ate well, and slept well, and became very merry. But at last he&#10;began to tease Bellissima, as the little dog was called. This made&#10;the woman angry, and she scolded him and threatened him, which made&#10;him very unhappy, and he went and sat in his own room full of sad&#10;thoughts. This chamber looked upon the street, in which hung skins&#10;to dry, and there were thick iron bars across his window. That&#10;night he lay awake, thinking of the Metal Pig; indeed, it was&#10;always in his thoughts. Suddenly he fancied he heard feet outside&#10;going pit-a-pat. He sprung out of bed and went to the window. Could&#10;it be the Metal Pig? But there was nothing to be seen; whatever he&#10;had heard had passed already. Next morning, their neighbor, the&#10;artist, passed by, carrying a paint-box and a large roll of&#10;canvas.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Help the gentleman to carry his box of colors,&#34; said the&#10;woman to the boy; and he obeyed instantly, took the box, and&#10;followed the painter. They walked on till they reached the picture&#10;gallery, and mounted the same staircase up which he had ridden that&#10;night on the Metal Pig. He remembered all the statues and pictures,&#10;the beautiful marble Venus, and again he looked at the Madonna with&#10;the Saviour and St. John. They stopped before the picture by&#10;Bronzino, in which Christ is represented as standing in the lower&#10;world, with the children smiling before Him, in the sweet&#10;expectation of entering heaven; and the poor boy smiled, too, for&#10;here was his heaven.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You may go home now,&#34; said the painter, while the boy&#10;stood watching him, till he had set up his easel.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;May I see you paint?&#34; asked the boy; &#34;may I see you put&#10;the picture on this white canvas?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I am not going to paint yet,&#34; replied the artist; then he&#10;brought out a piece of chalk. His hand moved quickly, and his eye&#10;measured the great picture; and though nothing appeared but a faint&#10;line, the figure of the Saviour was as clearly visible as in the&#10;colored picture.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Why don&#39;t you go?&#34; said the painter. Then the boy&#10;wandered home silently, and seated himself on the table, and&#10;learned to sew gloves. But all day long his thoughts were in the&#10;picture gallery; and so he pricked his fingers and was awkward. But&#10;he did not tease Bellissima. When evening came, and the house door&#10;stood open, he slipped out. It was a bright, beautiful, starlight&#10;evening, but rather cold. Away he went through the already-deserted&#10;streets, and soon came to the Metal Pig; he stooped down and kissed&#10;its shining nose, and then seated himself on its back.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You happy creature,&#34; he said; &#34;how I have longed for you!&#10;we must take a ride to-night.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But the Metal Pig lay motionless, while the fresh stream&#10;gushed forth from its mouth. The little boy still sat astride on&#10;its back, when he felt something pulling at his clothes. He looked&#10;down, and there was Bellissima, little smooth-shaven Bellissima,&#10;barking as if she would have said, &#34;Here I am too; why are you&#10;sitting there?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A fiery dragon could not have frightened the little boy so&#10;much as did the little dog in this place. &#34;Bellissima in the&#10;street, and not dressed!&#34; as the old lady called it; &#34;what would be&#10;the end of this?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The dog never went out in winter, unless she was attired&#10;in a little lambskin coat which had been made for her; it was&#10;fastened round the little dog&#39;s neck and body with red ribbons, and&#10;was decorated with rosettes and little bells. The dog looked almost&#10;like a little kid when she was allowed to go out in winter, and&#10;trot after her mistress. And now here she was in the cold, and not&#10;dressed. Oh, how would it end? All his fancies were quickly put to&#10;flight; yet he kissed the Metal Pig once more, and then took&#10;Bellissima in his arms. The poor little thing trembled so with&#10;cold, that the boy ran homeward as fast as he could.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What are you running away with there?&#34; asked two of the&#10;police whom he met, and at whom the dog barked. &#34;Where have you&#10;stolen that pretty dog?&#34; they asked; and they took it away from&#10;him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, I have not stolen it; do give it to me back again,&#34;&#10;cried the boy, despairingly.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;If you have not stolen it, you may say at home that they&#10;can send to the watch-house for the dog.&#34; Then they told him where&#10;the watch-house was, and went away with Bellissima.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Here was a dreadful trouble. The boy did not know whether&#10;he had better jump into the Arno, or go home and confess&#10;everything. They would certainly kill him, he thought.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Well, I would gladly be killed,&#34; he reasoned; &#34;for then I&#10;shall die, and go to heaven:&#34; and so he went home, almost hoping&#10;for death.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The door was locked, and he could not reach the knocker.&#10;No one was in the street; so he took up a stone, and with it made a&#10;tremendous noise at the door.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Who is there?&#34; asked somebody from within.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It is I,&#34; said he. &#34;Bellissima is gone. Open the door,&#10;and then kill me.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then indeed there was a great panic. Madame was so very&#10;fond of Bellissima. She immediately looked at the wall where the&#10;dog&#39;s dress usually hung; and there was the little&#10;lambskin.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Bellissima in the watch-house!&#34; she cried. &#34;You bad boy!&#10;how did you entice her out? Poor little delicate thing, with those&#10;rough policemen! and she&#39;ll be frozen with cold.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Giuseppe went off at once, while his wife lamented, and&#10;the boy wept. Several of the neighbors came in, and amongst them&#10;the painter. He took the boy between his knees, and questioned him;&#10;and, in broken sentences, he soon heard the whole story, and also&#10;about the Metal Pig, and the wonderful ride to the picture-gallery,&#10;which was certainly rather incomprehensible. The painter, however,&#10;consoled the little fellow, and tried to soften the lady&#39;s anger;&#10;but she would not be pacified till her husband returned with&#10;Bellissima, who had been with the police. Then there was great&#10;rejoicing, and the painter caressed the boy, and gave him a number&#10;of pictures. Oh, what beautiful pictures these were!&#8212;figures with&#10;funny heads; and, above all, the Metal Pig was there too. Oh,&#10;nothing could be more delightful. By means of a few strokes, it was&#10;made to appear on the paper; and even the house that stood behind&#10;it had been sketched in. Oh, if he could only draw and paint! He&#10;who could do this could conjure all the world before him. The first&#10;leisure moment during the next day, the boy got a pencil, and on&#10;the back of one of the other drawings he attempted to copy the&#10;drawing of the Metal Pig, and he succeeded. Certainly it was rather&#10;crooked, rather up and down, one leg thick, and another thin; still&#10;it was like the copy, and he was overjoyed at what he had done. The&#10;pencil would not go quite as it ought,&#8212;he had found that out; but&#10;the next day he tried again. A second pig was drawn by the side of&#10;the first, and this looked a hundred times better; and the third&#10;attempt was so good, that everybody might know what it was meant to&#10;represent.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And now the glovemaking went on but slowly. The orders&#10;given by the shops in the town were not finished quickly; for the&#10;Metal Pig had taught the boy that all objects may be drawn upon&#10;paper; and Florence is a picture-book in itself for any one who&#10;chooses to turn over its pages. On the Piazza dell Trinita stands a&#10;slender pillar, and upon it is the goddess of Justice, blindfolded,&#10;with her scales in her hand. She was soon represented on paper, and&#10;it was the glovemaker&#39;s boy who placed her there. His collection of&#10;pictures increased; but as yet they were only copies of lifeless&#10;objects, when one day Bellissima came gambolling before him: &#34;Stand&#10;still,&#34; cried he, &#34;and I will draw you beautifully, to put amongst&#10;my collection.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But Bellissima would not stand still, so she must be bound&#10;fast in one position. He tied her head and tail; but she barked and&#10;jumped, and so pulled and tightened the string, that she was nearly&#10;strangled; and just then her mistress walked in.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You wicked boy! the poor little creature!&#34; was all she&#10;could utter.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;She pushed the boy from her, thrust him away with her&#10;foot, called him a most ungrateful, good-for-nothing, wicked boy,&#10;and forbade him to enter the house again. Then she wept, and kissed&#10;her little half-strangled Bellissima. At this moment the painter&#10;entered the room.&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;hr /&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the year 1834 there was an exhibition in the Academy of&#10;Arts at Florence. Two pictures, placed side by side, attracted a&#10;large number of spectators. The smaller of the two represented a&#10;little boy sitting at a table, drawing; before him was a little&#10;white poodle, curiously shaven; but as the animal would not stand&#10;still, it had been fastened with a string to its head and tail, to&#10;keep it in one position. The truthfulness and life in this picture&#10;interested every one. The painter was said to be a young&#10;Florentine, who had been found in the streets, when a child, by an&#10;old glovemaker, who had brought him up. The boy had taught himself&#10;to draw: it was also said that a young artist, now famous, had&#10;discovered talent in the child just as he was about to be sent away&#10;for having tied up madame&#39;s favorite little dog, and using it as a&#10;model. The glovemaker&#39;s boy had also become a great painter, as the&#10;picture proved; but the larger picture by its side was a still&#10;greater proof of his talent. It represented a handsome boy, clothed&#10;in rags, lying asleep, and leaning against the Metal Pig in the&#10;street of the Porta Rosa. All the spectators knew the spot well.&#10;The child&#39;s arms were round the neck of the Pig, and he was in a&#10;deep sleep. The lamp before the picture of the Madonna threw a&#10;strong, effective light on the pale, delicate face of the child. It&#10;was a beautiful picture. A large gilt frame surrounded it, and on&#10;one corner of the frame a laurel wreath had been hung; but a black&#10;band, twined unseen among the green leaves, and a streamer of&#10;crape, hung down from it; for within the last few days the young&#10;artist had&#8212;died. &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode(''), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;IN a nursery where a number of toys lay scattered about, a&#10;money-box stood on the top of a very high wardrobe. It was made of&#10;clay in the shape of a pig, and had been bought of the potter. In&#10;the back of the pig was a slit, and this slit had been enlarged&#10;with a knife, so that dollars, or crown pieces, might slip through;&#10;and, indeed there were two in the box, besides a number of pence.&#10;The money-pig was stuffed so full that it could no longer rattle,&#10;which is the highest state of perfection to which a money-pig can&#10;attain. There he stood upon the cupboard, high and lofty, looking&#10;down upon everything else in the room. He knew very well that he&#10;had enough inside him to buy up all the other toys, and this gave&#10;him a very good opinion of his own value. The rest thought of this&#10;fact also, although they did not express it, for there were so many&#10;other things to talk about. A large doll, still handsome, though&#10;rather old, for her neck had been mended, lay inside one of the&#10;drawers which was partly open. She called out to the others, &#34;Let&#10;us have a game at being men and women, that is something worth&#10;playing at.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Upon this there was a great uproar; even the engravings,&#10;which hung in frames on the wall, turned round in their excitement,&#10;and showed that they had a wrong side to them, although they had&#10;not the least intention to expose themselves in this way, or to&#10;object to the game. It was late at night, but as the moon shone&#10;through the windows, they had light at a cheap rate. And as the&#10;game was now to begin, all were invited to take part in it, even&#10;the children&#39;s wagon, which certainly belonged to the coarser&#10;playthings. &#34;Each has its own value,&#34; said the wagon; &#34;we cannot&#10;all be noblemen; there must be some to do the work.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The money-pig was the only one who received a written&#10;invitation. He stood so high that they were afraid he would not&#10;accept a verbal message. But in his reply, he said, if he had to&#10;take a part, he must enjoy the sport from his own home; they were&#10;to arrange for him to do so; and so they did. The little toy&#10;theatre was therefore put up in such a way that the money-pig could&#10;look directly into it. Some wanted to begin with a comedy, and&#10;afterwards to have a tea party and a discussion for mental&#10;improvement, but they commenced with the latter first. The&#10;rocking-horse spoke of training and races; the wagon of railways&#10;and steam power, for these subjects belonged to each of their&#10;professions, and it was right they should talk of them. The clock&#10;talked politics&#8212;&#34;tick, tick;&#34; he professed to know what was the&#10;time of day, but there was a whisper that he did not go correctly.&#10;The bamboo cane stood by, looking stiff and proud: he was vain of&#10;his brass ferrule and silver top, and on the sofa lay two worked&#10;cushions, pretty but stupid. When the play at the little theatre&#10;began, the rest sat and looked on; they were requested to applaud&#10;and stamp, or crack, when they felt gratified with what they saw.&#10;But the riding-whip said he never cracked for old people, only for&#10;the young who were not yet married. &#34;I crack for everybody,&#34; said&#10;the cracker.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, and a fine noise you make,&#34; thought the audience, as&#10;the play went on.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was not worth much, but it was very well played, and&#10;all the characters turned their painted sides to the audience, for&#10;they were made only to be seen on one side. The acting was&#10;wonderful, excepting that sometimes they came out beyond the lamps,&#10;because the wires were a little too long. The doll, whose neck had&#10;been darned, was so excited that the place in her neck burst, and&#10;the money-pig declared he must do something for one of the players,&#10;as they had all pleased him so much. So he made up his mind to&#10;remember one of them in his will, as the one to be buried with him&#10;in the family vault, whenever that event should happen. They all&#10;enjoyed the comedy so much, that they gave up all thoughts of the&#10;tea party, and only carried out their idea of intellectual&#10;amusement, which they called playing at men and women; and there&#10;was nothing wrong about it, for it was only play. All the while,&#10;each one thought most of himself, or of what the money-pig could be&#10;thinking. His thoughts were on, as he supposed, a very distant&#10;time&#8212;of making his will, and of his burial, and of when it might&#10;all come to pass. Certainly sooner than he expected&#8212;for all at once&#10;down he came from the top of the press, fell on the ground, and was&#10;broken to pieces. Then the pennies hopped and danced about in the&#10;most amusing manner. The little ones twirled round like tops, and&#10;the large ones rolled away as far as they could, especially the one&#10;great silver crown piece who had often to go out into the world,&#10;and now he had his wish as well as all the rest of the money. The&#10;pieces of the money-pig were thrown into the dust-bin, and the next&#10;day there stood a new money-pig on the cupboard, but it had not a&#10;farthing in its inside yet, and therefore, like the old one, it&#10;could not rattle. This was the beginning with him, and we will make&#10;it the end of our story. &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')

Instead of the forest and the&#10;green hills of former days, I had here only a forest of&#10;chimney-pots to look out upon. And then I had not a single friend;&#10;not one familiar face greeted me.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;So one evening I sat at the window, in a desponding mood;&#10;and presently I opened the casement and looked out. Oh, how my&#10;heart leaped up with joy! Here was a well-known face at last&#8212;a&#10;round, friendly countenance, the face of a good friend I had known&#10;at home. In, fact, it was the MOON that looked in upon me. He was&#10;quite unchanged, the dear old Moon, and had the same face exactly&#10;that he used to show when he peered down upon me through the willow&#10;trees on the moor. I kissed my hand to him over and over again, as&#10;he shone far into my little room; and he, for his part, promised me&#10;that every evening, when he came abroad, he would look in upon me&#10;for a few moments. This promise he has faithfully kept. It is a&#10;pity that he can only stay such a short time when he comes.&#10;Whenever he appears, he tells me of one thing or another that he&#10;has seen on the previous night, or on that same evening. &#34;Just&#10;paint the scenes I describe to you&#34;&#8212;this is what he said to me&#8212;&#34;and&#10;you will have a very pretty picture-book.&#34; I have followed his&#10;injunction for many evenings. I could make up a new &#34;Thousand and&#10;One Nights,&#34; in my own way, out of these pictures, but the number&#10;might be too great, after all. The pictures I have here given have&#10;not been chosen at random, but follow in their proper order, just&#10;as they were described to me. Some great gifted painter, or some&#10;poet or musician, may make something more of them if he likes; what&#10;I have given here are only hasty sketches, hurriedly put upon the&#10;paper, with some of my own thoughts, interspersed; for the Moon did&#10;not come to me every evening&#8212;a cloud sometimes hid his face from&#10;me.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')

My face was&#10;mirrored in the waters of the Ganges, and my beams strove to pierce&#10;through the thick intertwining boughs of the bananas, arching&#10;beneath me like the tortoise&#39;s shell. Forth from the thicket&#10;tripped a Hindoo maid, light as a gazelle, beautiful as Eve. Airy&#10;and etherial as a vision, and yet sharply defined amid the&#10;surrounding shadows, stood this daughter of Hindostan: I could read&#10;on her delicate brow the thought that had brought her hither. The&#10;thorny creeping plants tore her sandals, but for all that she came&#10;rapidly forward. The deer that had come down to the river to quench&#10;her thirst, sprang by with a startled bound, for in her hand the&#10;maiden bore a lighted lamp. I could see the blood in her delicate&#10;finger tips, as she spread them for a screen before the dancing&#10;flame. She came down to the stream, and set the lamp upon the&#10;water, and let it float away. The flame flickered to and fro, and&#10;seemed ready to expire; but still the lamp burned on, and the&#10;girl&#39;s black sparkling eyes, half veiled behind their long silken&#10;lashes, followed it with a gaze of earnest intensity. She knew that&#10;if the lamp continued to burn so long as she could keep it in&#10;sight, her betrothed was still alive; but if the lamp was suddenly&#10;extinguished, he was dead. And the lamp burned bravely on, and she&#10;fell on her knees, and prayed. Near her in the grass lay a speckled&#10;snake, but she heeded it not&#8212;she thought only of Bramah and of her&#10;betrothed. &#39;He lives!&#39; she shouted joyfully, &#39;he lives!&#39; And from&#10;the mountains the echo came back upon her, &#39;he lives!&#39;&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')

In the courtyard&#10;sat a clucking hen with eleven chickens; and a pretty little girl&#10;was running and jumping around them. The hen was frightened, and&#10;screamed, and spread out her wings over the little brood. Then the&#10;girl&#39;s father came out and scolded her; and I glided away and&#10;thought no more of the matter.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But this evening, only a few minutes ago, I looked down&#10;into the same courtyard. Everything was quiet. But presently the&#10;little girl came forth again, crept quietly to the hen-house,&#10;pushed back the bolt, and slipped into the apartment of the hen and&#10;chickens. They cried out loudly, and came fluttering down from&#10;their perches, and ran about in dismay, and the little girl ran&#10;after them. I saw it quite plainly, for I looked through a hole in&#10;the hen-house wall. I was angry with the willful child, and felt&#10;glad when her father came out and scolded her more violently than&#10;yesterday, holding her roughly by the arm; she held down her head,&#10;and her blue eyes were full of large tears. &#39;What are you about&#10;here?&#39; he asked. She wept and said, &#39;I wanted to kiss the hen and&#10;beg her pardon for frightening her yesterday; but I was afraid to&#10;tell you.&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And the father kissed the innocent child&#39;s forehead, and&#10;I kissed her on the mouth and eyes.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;div&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/div&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')

Sixteen years ago&#10;that woman was a child, playing in the garden of the old parsonage,&#10;in the country. The hedges of rose-bush were old, and the flowers&#10;were faded. They straggled wild over the paths, and the ragged&#10;branches grew up among the boughs of the apple trees; here and&#10;there were a few roses still in bloom&#8212;not so fair as the queen of&#10;flowers generally appears, but still they had colour and scent too.&#10;The clergyman&#39;s little daughter appeared to me a far lovelier rose,&#10;as she sat on her stool under the straggling hedge, hugging and&#10;caressing her doll with the battered pasteboard cheeks.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ten years afterwards I saw her again.

There are tragedies in every-day life, and tonight I saw&#10;the last act of one.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;She was lying in bed in a house in that narrow street:&#10;she was sick unto death, and the cruel landlord came up, and tore&#10;away the thin coverlet, her only protection against the cold. &#39;Get&#10;up!&#39; said he; &#39;your face is enough to frighten one. Get up and&#10;dress yourself, give me money, or I&#39;ll turn you out into the&#10;street! Quick&#8212;get up!&#39; She answered, &#39;Alas! death is gnawing at my&#10;heart. Let me rest.&#39; But he forced her to get up and bathe her&#10;face, and put a wreath of roses in her hair; and he placed her in a&#10;chair at the window, with a candle burning beside her, and went&#10;away.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I looked at her, and she was sitting motionless, with her&#10;hands in her lap. The wind caught the open window and shut it with&#10;a crash, so that a pane came clattering down in fragments; but&#10;still she never moved. The curtain caught fire, and the flames&#10;played about her face; and I saw that she was dead. There at the&#10;open window sat the dead woman, preaching a sermon against sin&#8212;my&#10;poor faded rose out of the parsonage garden!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')

A stable had been turned into a theatre;&#10;that is to say, the stable had been left standing, and had been&#10;turned into private boxes, and all the timber work had been covered&#10;with coloured paper. A little iron chandelier hung beneath the&#10;ceiling, and that it might be made to disappear into the ceiling,&#10;as it does in great theatres, when the ting-ting of the prompter&#39;s&#10;bell is heard, a great inverted tub has been placed just above&#10;it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;Ting-ting!&#39; and the little iron chandelier suddenly rose&#10;at least half a yard and disappeared in the tub; and that was the&#10;sign that the play was going to begin.

An old grandmother, poorly clad&#8212;she belonged to the working&#10;class&#8212;was following one of the under-servants into the great empty&#10;throne-room, for this was the apartment she wanted to see&#8212;that she&#10;was resolved to see; it had cost her many a little sacrifice, and&#10;many a coaxing word, to penetrate thus far.

Died!&#39; mournfully repeated the old&#10;woman. I do not think another word was spoken, and they soon&#10;quitted the hall.

The people stormed the&#10;Tuileries. Even women and children were to be found among the&#10;combatants. They penetrated into the apartments and halls of the&#10;palace. A poor half-grown boy in a ragged blouse fought among the&#10;older insurgents. Mortally wounded with several bayonet thrusts, he&#10;sank down. This happened in the throne-room. They laid the bleeding&#10;youth upon the throne of France, wrapped the velvet around his&#10;wounds, and his blood streamed forth upon the imperial purple.&#10;There was a picture! The splendid hall, the fighting groups! A torn&#10;flag upon the ground, the tricolor was waving above the bayonets,&#10;and on the throne lay the poor lad with the pale glorified&#10;countenance, his eyes turned towards the sky, his limbs writhing in&#10;the death agony, his breast bare, and his poor tattered clothing&#10;half hidden by the rich velvet embroidered with silver lilies. At&#10;the boy&#39;s cradle a prophecy had been spoken: &#39;He will die on the&#10;throne of France!&#39; The mother&#39;s heart dreamt of a second&#10;Napoleon.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;My beams have kissed the wreath of immortelles on his&#10;grave, and this night they kissed the forehead of the old grandame,&#10;while in a dream the picture floated before her which thou mayest&#10;draw&#8212;the poor boy on the throne of France.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')

A Hun&#39;s&#10;Grave lies there, and the sloe and blackthorn grow luxuriantly&#10;among the stones. Here is true poetry in nature.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And how do you think men appreciate this poetry? I will&#10;tell you what I heard there last evening and during the&#10;night.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;First, two rich landed proprietors came driving by.&#10;&#39;Those are glorious trees!&#39; said the first. &#39;Certainly; there are&#10;ten loads of firewood in each,&#39; observed the other: &#39;it will be a&#10;hard winter, and last year we got fourteen dollars a load&#39;&#8212;and they&#10;were gone. &#39;The road here is wretched,&#39; observed another man who&#10;drove past. &#39;That&#39;s the fault of those horrible trees,&#39; replied his&#10;neighbour; &#39;there is no free current of air; the wind can only come&#10;from the sea&#39;&#8212;and they were gone. The stage coach went rattling&#10;past. All the passengers were asleep at this beautiful spot. The&#10;postillion blew his horn, but he only thought, &#39;I can play&#10;capitally. It sounds well here. I wonder if those in there like&#10;it?&#39;&#8212;and the stage coach vanished. Then two young fellows came&#10;gallopping up on horseback. There&#39;s youth and spirit in the blood&#10;here! thought I; and, indeed, they looked with a smile at the&#10;moss-grown hill and thick forest. &#39;I should not dislike a walk here&#10;with the miller&#39;s Christine,&#39; said one&#8212;and they flew&#10;past.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The flowers scented the air; every breath of air was&#10;hushed; it seemed as if the sea were a part of the sky that&#10;stretched above the deep valley. A carriage rolled by. Six people&#10;were sitting in it. Four of them were asleep; the fifth was&#10;thinking of his new summer coat, which would suit him admirably;&#10;the sixth turned to the coachman and asked him if there were&#10;anything remarkable connected with yonder heap of stones. &#39;No,&#39;&#10;replied the coachman, &#39;it&#39;s only a heap of stones; but the trees&#10;are remarkable.&#39; &#39;How so?&#39; &#39;Why I&#39;ll tell you how they are very&#10;remarkable. You see, in winter, when the snow lies very deep, and&#10;has hidden the whole road so that nothing is to be seen, those&#10;trees serve me for a landmark. I steer by them, so as not to drive&#10;into the sea; and you see that is why the trees are&#10;remarkable.&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Now came a painter. He spoke not a word, but his eyes&#10;sparkled. He began to whistle. At this the nightingales sang louder&#10;than ever. &#39;Hold your tongues!&#39; he cried testily; and he made&#10;accurate notes of all the colours and transitions&#8212;blue, and lilac,&#10;and dark brown. &#39;That will make a beautiful picture,&#39; he said. He&#10;took it in just as a mirror takes in a view; and as he worked he&#10;whistled a march of Rossini. And last of all came a poor girl. She&#10;laid aside the burden she carried, and sat down to rest upon the&#10;Hun&#39;s Grave. Her pale handsome face was bent in a listening&#10;attitude towards the forest. Her eyes brightened, she gazed&#10;earnestly at the sea and the sky, her hands were folded, and I&#10;think she prayed, &#39;Our Father.&#39; She herself could not understand&#10;the feeling that swept through her, but I know that this minute,&#10;and the beautiful natural scene, will live within her memory for&#10;years, far more vividly and more truly than the painter could&#10;portray it with his colours on paper. My rays followed her till the&#10;morning dawn kissed her brow.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')

I stood in my little room, more lonely than&#10;ever, and looked up at the sky where he ought to have shown&#10;himself. My thoughts flew far away, up to my great friend, who&#10;every evening told me such pretty tales, and showed me pictures.&#10;Yes, he has had an experience indeed. He glided over the waters of&#10;the Deluge, and smiled on Noah&#39;s ark just as he lately glanced down&#10;upon me, and brought comfort and promise of a new world that was to&#10;spring forth from the old. When the Children of Israel sat weeping&#10;by the waters of Babylon, he glanced mournfully upon the willows&#10;where hung the silent harps. When Romeo climbed the balcony, and&#10;the promise of true love fluttered like a cherub toward heaven, the&#10;round Moon hung, half hidden among the dark cypresses, in the lucid&#10;air. He saw the captive giant at St. Helena, looking from the&#10;lonely rock across the wide ocean, while great thoughts swept&#10;through his soul. Ah! what tales the Moon can tell. Human life is&#10;like a story to him. To-night I shall not see thee again, old&#10;friend. Tonight I can draw no picture of the memories of thy visit.&#10;And, as I looked dreamily towards the clouds, the sky became&#10;bright. There was a glancing light, and a beam from the Moon fell&#10;upon me. It vanished again, and dark clouds flew past: but still it&#10;was a greeting, a friendly good-night offered to me by the&#10;Moon.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')

Several evenings had passed, and&#10;the Moon was in the first quarter. Again he gave me an outline for&#10;a sketch. Listen to what he told me.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I have followed the polar bird and the swimming whale to&#10;the eastern coast of Greenland. Gaunt ice-covered rocks and dark&#10;clouds hung over a valley, where dwarf willows and barberry bushes&#10;stood clothed in green. The blooming lychnis exhaled sweet odours.&#10;My light was faint, my face pale as the water lily that, torn from&#10;its stem, has been drifting for weeks with the tide. The&#10;crown-shaped Northern Light burned fiercely in the sky. Its ring&#10;was broad, and from its circumference the rays shot like whirling&#10;shafts of fire across the whole sky, flashing in changing radiance&#10;from green to red. The inhabitants of that icy region were&#10;assembling for dance and festivity; but, accustomed to this&#10;glorious spectacle, they scarcely deigned to glance at it. &#39;Let us&#10;leave the soul of the dead to their ball-play with the heads of the&#10;walruses,&#39; they thought in their superstition, and they turned&#10;their whole attention to the song and dance. In the midst of the&#10;circle, and divested of his furry cloak, stood a Greenlander, with&#10;a small pipe, and he played and sang a song about catching the&#10;seal, and the chorus around chimed in with, &#39;Eia, Eia, Ah.&#39; And in&#10;their white furs they danced about in the circle, till you might&#10;fancy it was a polar bear&#39;s ball.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And now a Court of Judgment was opened. Those&#10;Greenlanders who had quarrelled stepped forward, and the offended&#10;person chanted forth the faults of his adversary in an extempore&#10;song, turning them sharply into ridicule, to the sound of the pipe&#10;and the measure of the dance. The defendant replied with satire as&#10;keen, while the audience laughed, and gave their verdict. The rocks&#10;heaved, the glaciers melted, and great masses of ice and snow came&#10;crashing down, shivering to fragments as they fall; it was a&#10;glorious Greenland summer night. A hundred paces away, under the&#10;open tent of hides, lay a sick man. Life still flowed through his&#10;warm blood, but still he was to die&#8212;he himself felt it, and all who&#10;stood round him knew it also; therefore his wife was already sewing&#10;round him the shroud of furs, that she might not afterwards be&#10;obliged to touch the dead body. And she asked, &#39;Wilt thou be buried&#10;on the rock, in the firm snow? I will deck the spot with thy kayak,&#10;and thy arrows, and the angekokk shall dance over it. Or wouldst&#10;thou rather be buried in the sea?&#39; &#39;In the sea,&#39; he whispered, and&#10;nodded with a mournful smile. &#39;Yes, it is a pleasant summer tent,&#10;the sea,&#39; observed the wife. &#39;Thousands of seals sport there, the&#10;walrus shall lie at thy feet, and the hunt will be safe and merry!&#39;&#10;And the yelling children tore the outspread hide from the&#10;window-hole, that the dead man might be carried to the ocean, the&#10;billowy ocean, that had given him food in life, and that now, in&#10;death, was to afford him a place of rest. For his monument, he had&#10;the floating, ever-changing icebergs, whereon the seal sleeps,&#10;while the storm bird flies round their gleaming&#10;summits!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')

In summer she always wore the same&#10;straw hat, and I verily believe the very same gray-blue&#10;dress.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;She never went out, except across the street to an old&#10;female friend; and in later years she did not even take this walk,&#10;for the old friend was dead. In her solitude my old maid was always&#10;busy at the window, which was adorned in summer with pretty&#10;flowers, and in winter with cress, grown upon felt. During the last&#10;months I saw her no more at the window, but she was still alive. I&#10;knew that, for I had not yet seen her begin the &#39;long journey,&#39; of&#10;which she often spoke with her friend. &#39;Yes, yes,&#39; she was in the&#10;habit of saying, when I come to die I shall take a longer journey&#10;than I have made my whole life long. Our family vault is six miles&#10;from here. I shall be carried there, and shall sleep there among my&#10;family and relatives.&#39; Last night a van stopped at the house. A&#10;coffin was carried out, and then I knew that she was dead. They&#10;placed straw round the coffin, and the van drove away. There slept&#10;the quiet old lady, who had not gone out of her house once for the&#10;last year. The van rolled out through the town-gate as briskly as&#10;if it were going for a pleasant excursion. On the high-road the&#10;pace was quicker yet. The coachman looked nervously round every now&#10;and then&#8212;I fancy he half expected to see her sitting on the coffin,&#10;in her yellow satin wrapper. And because he was startled, he&#10;foolishly lashed his horses, while he held the reins so tightly&#10;that the poor beasts were in a foam: they were young and fiery. A&#10;hare jumped across the road and startled them, and they fairly ran&#10;away. The old sober maiden, who had for years and years moved&#10;quietly round and round in a dull circle, was now, in death,&#10;rattled over stock and stone on the public highway. The coffin in&#10;its covering of straw tumbled out of the van, and was left on the&#10;high-road, while horses, coachman, and carriage flew past in wild&#10;career. The lark rose up carolling from the field, twittering her&#10;morning lay over the coffin, and presently perched upon it, picking&#10;with her beak at the straw covering, as though she would tear it&#10;up. The lark rose up again, singing gaily, and I withdrew behind&#10;the red morning clouds.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')

Now, the stillness of death reigned around. German&#10;mercenaries, in the Neapolitan service, kept guard, played cards,&#10;and diced; and a troop of strangers from beyond the mountains came&#10;into the town, accompanied by a sentry. They wanted to see the city&#10;that had risen from the grave illumined by my beams; and I showed&#10;them the wheel-ruts in the streets paved with broad lava slabs; I&#10;showed them the names on the doors, and the signs that hung there&#10;yet: they saw in the little courtyard the basins of the fountains,&#10;ornamented with shells; but no jet of water gushed upwards, no&#10;songs sounded forth from the richly-painted chambers, where the&#10;bronze dog kept the door.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It was the City of the Dead; only Vesuvius thundered&#10;forth his everlasting hymn, each separate verse of which is called&#10;by men an eruption. We went to the temple of Venus, built of&#10;snow-white marble, with its high altar in front of the broad steps,&#10;and the weeping willows sprouting freshly forth among the pillars.&#10;The air was transparent and blue, and black Vesuvius formed the&#10;background, with fire ever shooting forth from it, like the stem of&#10;the pine tree. Above it stretched the smoky cloud in the silence of&#10;the night, like the crown of the pine, but in a blood-red&#10;illumination. Among the company was a lady singer, a real and great&#10;singer. I have witnessed the homage paid to her in the greatest&#10;cities of Europe. When they came to the tragic theatre, they all&#10;sat down on the amphitheatre steps, and thus a small part of the&#10;house was occupied by an audience, as it had been many centuries&#10;ago. The stage still stood unchanged, with its walled side-scenes,&#10;and the two arches in the background, through which the beholders&#10;saw the same scene that had been exhibited in the old times&#8212;a scene&#10;painted by nature herself, namely, the mountains between Sorento&#10;and Amalfi. The singer gaily mounted the ancient stage, and sang.&#10;The place inspired her, and she reminded me of a wild Arab horse,&#10;that rushes headlong on with snorting nostrils and flying mane&#8212;her&#10;song was so light and yet so firm. Anon I thought of the mourning&#10;mother beneath the cross at Golgotha, so deep was the expression of&#10;pain. And, just as it had done thousands of years ago, the sound of&#10;applause and delight now filled the theatre. &#39;Happy, gifted&#10;creature!&#39; all the hearers exclaimed. Five minutes more, and the&#10;stage was empty, the company had vanished, and not a sound more was&#10;heard&#8212;all were gone. But the ruins stood unchanged, as they will&#10;stand when centuries shall have gone by, and when none shall know&#10;of the momentary applause and of the triumph of the fair&#10;songstress; when all will be forgotten and gone, and even for me&#10;this hour will be but a dream of the past.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')

I saw handsome furniture,&#10;many books, and a chaos of newspapers. Several young men were&#10;present: the editor himself stood at his desk, and two little&#10;books, both by young authors, were to be noticed. &#39;This one has&#10;been sent to me,&#39; said he. &#39;I have not read it yet; what think you&#10;of the contents?&#39; &#39;Oh,&#39; said the person addressed&#8212;he was a poet&#10;himself&#8212;&#39;it is good enough; a little broad, certainly; but, you&#10;see, the author is still young. The verses might be better, to be&#10;sure; the thoughts are sound, though there is certainly a good deal&#10;of common-place among them. But what will you have? You can&#39;t be&#10;always getting something new. That he&#39;ll turn out anything great I&#10;don&#39;t believe, but you may safely praise him. He is well read, a&#10;remarkable Oriental scholar, and has a good judgment. It was he who&#10;wrote that nice review of my &#39;Reflections on Domestic Life.&#39; We&#10;must be lenient towards the young man.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;But he is a complete hack!&#39; objected another of the&#10;gentlemen. &#39;Nothing worse in poetry than mediocrity, and he&#10;certainly does not go beyond this.&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;Poor fellow,&#39; observed a third, &#39;and his aunt is so&#10;happy about him.

But this other book&#8212;I&#10;suppose the author expects me to purchase it?

The punctuation of the book,&#10;in particular, is very eccentric.&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;It will be good for him if we pull him to pieces, and&#10;anger him a little, otherwise he will get too good an opinion of&#10;himself.&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;But that would be unfair,&#39; objected the fourth. &#39;Let us&#10;not carp at little faults, but rejoice over the real and abundant&#10;good that we find here: he surpasses all the rest.&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;Not so. If he is a true genius, he can bear the sharp&#10;voice of censure. There are people enough to praise him.

I saw a caravan of&#10;emigrant peasant families who were bound to Hamburgh, there to take&#10;ship for America, where fancied prosperity would bloom for them.&#10;The mothers carried their little children at their backs, the elder&#10;ones tottered by their sides, and a poor starved horse tugged at a&#10;cart that bore their scanty effects. The cold wind whistled, and&#10;therefore the little girl nestled closer to the mother, who,&#10;looking up at my decreasing disc, thought of the bitter want at&#10;home, and spoke of the heavy taxes they had not been able to raise.&#10;The whole caravan thought of the same thing; therefore, the rising&#10;dawn seemed to them a message from the sun, of fortune that was to&#10;gleam brightly upon them. They heard the dying nightingale sing; it&#10;was no false prophet, but a harbinger of fortune. The wind&#10;whistled, therefore they did not understand that the nightingale&#10;sung, &#39;Fare away over the sea! Thou hast paid the long passage with&#10;all that was thine, and poor and helpless shalt thou enter Canaan.&#10;Thou must sell thyself, thy wife, and thy children. But your griefs&#10;shall not last long. Behind the broad fragrant leaves lurks the&#10;goddess of Death, and her welcome kiss shall breathe fever into thy&#10;blood. Fare away, fare away, over the heaving billows.&#39; And the&#10;caravan listened well pleased to the song of the nightingale, which&#10;seemed to promise good fortune. Day broke through the light clouds;&#10;country people went across the heath to church; the black-gowned&#10;women with their white head-dresses looked like ghosts that had&#10;stepped forth from the church pictures. All around lay a wide dead&#10;plain, covered with faded brown heath, and black charred spaces&#10;between the white sand hills. The women carried hymn books, and&#10;walked into the church. Oh, pray, pray for those who are wandering&#10;to find graves beyond the foaming billows.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('Fifteenth Evening'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I know a Pulcinella,&#34; the Moon told me. &#34;The public&#10;applaud vociferously directly they see him. Every one of his&#10;movements is comic, and is sure to throw the house into convulsions&#10;of laughter; and yet there is no art in it all&#8212;it is complete&#10;nature. When he was yet a little boy, playing about with other&#10;boys, he was already Punch. Nature had intended him for it, and had&#10;provided him with a hump on his back, and another on his breast;&#10;but his inward man, his mind, on the contrary, was richly&#10;furnished. No one could surpass him in depth of feeling or in&#10;readiness of intellect. The theatre was his ideal world. If he had&#10;possessed a slender well-shaped figure, he might have been the&#10;first tragedian on any stage; the heroic, the great, filled his&#10;soul; and yet he had to become a Pulcinella. His very sorrow and&#10;melancholy did but increase the comic dryness of his sharply-cut&#10;features, and increased the laughter of the audience, who showered&#10;plaudits on their favourite. The lovely Columbine was indeed kind&#10;and cordial to him; but she preferred to marry the Harlequin. It&#10;would have been too ridiculous if beauty and ugliness had in&#10;reality paired together.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;When Pulcinella was in very bad spirits, she was the only&#10;one who could force a hearty burst of laughter, or even a smile&#10;from him: first she would be melancholy with him, then quieter, and&#10;at last quite cheerful and happy. &#39;I know very well what is the&#10;matter with you,&#39; she said; &#39;yes, you&#39;re in love!&#39; And he could not&#10;help laughing. &#39;I and Love,&#34; he cried, &#34;that would have an absurd&#10;look. How the public would shout!&#39; &#39;Certainly, you are in love,&#39;&#10;she continued; and added with a comic pathos, &#39;and I am the person&#10;you are in love with.&#39; You see, such a thing may be said when it is&#10;quite out of the question&#8212;and, indeed, Pulcinella burst out&#10;laughing, and gave a leap into the air, and his melancholy was&#10;forgotten.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And yet she had only spoken the truth. He did love her,&#10;love her adoringly, as he loved what was great and lofty in art. At&#10;her wedding he was the merriest among the guests, but in the&#10;stillness of night he wept: if the public had seen his distorted&#10;face then, they would have applauded rapturously.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And a few days ago, Columbine died. On the day of the&#10;funeral, Harlequin was not required to show himself on the boards,&#10;for he was a disconsolate widower. The director had to give a very&#10;merry piece, that the public might not too painfully miss the&#10;pretty Columbine and the agile Harlequin. Therefore Pulcinella had&#10;to be more boisterous and extravagant than ever; and he danced and&#10;capered, with despair in his heart; and the audience yelled, and&#10;shouted &#39;bravo, bravissimo!&#39; Pulcinella was actually called before&#10;the curtain. He was pronounced inimitable.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But last night the hideous little fellow went out of the&#10;town, quite alone, to the deserted churchyard. The wreath of&#10;flowers on Columbine&#39;s grave was already faded, and he sat down&#10;there. It was a study for a painter. As he sat with his chin on his&#10;hands, his eyes turned up towards me, he looked like a grotesque&#10;monument&#8212;a Punch on a grave&#8212;peculiar and whimsical! If the people&#10;could have seen their favourite, they would have cried as usual,&#10;&#39;Bravo, Pulcinella; bravo, bravissimo!&#39;&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')

Whenever the jetty fountains splash into the&#10;marble basins, they seem to me to be telling the story of the&#10;floating city. Yes, the spouting water may tell of her, the waves&#10;of the sea may sing of her fame! On the surface of the ocean a mist&#10;often rests, and that is her widow&#39;s veil. The bridegroom of the&#10;sea is dead, his palace and his city are his mausoleum! Dost thou&#10;know this city? She has never heard the rolling of wheels or the&#10;hoof-tread of horses in her streets, through which the fish swim,&#10;while the black gondola glides spectrally over the green water. I&#10;will show you the place,&#34; continued the Moon, &#34;the largest square&#10;in it, and you will fancy yourself transported into the city of a&#10;fairy tale. The grass grows rank among the broad flagstones, and in&#10;the morning twilight thousands of tame pigeons flutter around the&#10;solitary lofty tower. On three sides you find yourself surrounded&#10;by cloistered walks. In these the silent Turk sits smoking his long&#10;pipe, the handsome Greek leans against the pillar and gazes at the&#10;upraised trophies and lofty masts, memorials of power that is gone.&#10;The flags hang down like mourning scarves. A girl rests there: she&#10;has put down her heavy pails filled with water, the yoke with which&#10;she has carried them rests on one of her shoulders, and she leans&#10;against the mast of victory. That is not a fairy palace you see&#10;before you yonder, but a church: the gilded domes and shining orbs&#10;flash back my beams; the glorious bronze horses up yonder have made&#10;journeys, like the bronze horse in the fairy tale: they have come&#10;hither, and gone hence, and have returned again. Do you notice the&#10;variegated splendour of the walls and windows? It looks as if&#10;Genius had followed the caprices of a child, in the adornment of&#10;these singular temples. Do you see the winged lion on the pillar?&#10;The gold glitters still, but his wings are tied&#8212;the lion is dead,&#10;for the king of the sea is dead; the great halls stand desolate,&#10;and where gorgeous paintings hung of yore, the naked wall now peers&#10;through. The lazzarone sleeps under the arcade, whose pavement in&#10;old times was to be trodden only by the feet of high nobility. From&#10;the deep wells, and perhaps from the prisons by the Bridge of&#10;Sighs, rise the accents of woe, as at the time when the tambourine&#10;was heard in the gay gondolas, and the golden ring was cast from&#10;the Bucentaur to Adria, the queen of the seas. Adria! shroud&#10;thyself in mists; let the veil of thy widowhood shroud thy form,&#10;and clothe in the weeds of woe the mausoleum of thy bridegroom&#8212;the&#10;marble, spectral Venice.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('Eighteenth Evening'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I looked down upon a great theatre,&#34; said the Moon. &#34;The&#10;house was crowded, for a new actor was to make his first appearance&#10;that night. My rays glided over a little window in the wall, and I&#10;saw a painted face with the forehead pressed against the panes. It&#10;was the hero of the evening. The knighly beard curled crisply about&#10;the chin; but there were tears in the man&#39;s eyes, for he had been&#10;hissed off, and indeed with reason. The poor Incapable! But&#10;Incapables cannot be admitted into the empire of Art. He had deep&#10;feeling, and loved his art enthusiastically, but the art loved not&#10;him. The prompter&#39;s bell sounded; &#39;the hero enters with a&#10;determined air,&#39; so ran the stage direction in his part, and he had&#10;to appear before an audience who turned him into ridicule. When the&#10;piece was over, I saw a form wrapped in a mantle, creeping down the&#10;steps: it was the vanquished knight of the evening. The&#10;scene-shifters whispered to one another, and I followed the poor&#10;fellow home to his room. To hang one&#39;s self is to die a mean death,&#10;and poison is not always at hand, I know; but he thought of both. I&#10;saw how he looked at his pale face in the glass, with eyes half&#10;closed, to see if he should look well as a corpse. A man may be&#10;very unhappy, and yet exceedingly affected. He thought of death, of&#10;suicide; I believe he pitied himself, for he wept bitterly, and&#10;when a man has had his cry out he doesn&#39;t kill himself.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Since that time a year had rolled by. Again a play was to&#10;be acted, but in a little theatre, and by a poor strolling company.&#10;Again I saw the well-remembered face, with the painted cheeks and&#10;the crisp beard. He looked up at me and smiled; and yet he had been&#10;hissed off only a minute before&#8212;hissed off from a wretched theatre,&#10;by a miserable audience. And tonight a shabby hearse rolled out of&#10;the town-gate. It was a suicide&#8212;our painted, despised hero. The&#10;driver of the hearse was the only person present, for no one&#10;followed except my beams. In a corner of the churchyard the corpse&#10;of the suicide was shovelled into the earth, and nettles will soon&#10;be growing rankly over his grave, and the sexton will throw thorns&#10;and weeds from the other graves upon it.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')

The wild fig tree grows in the clefts of the wall, and&#10;covers the nakedness thereof with its broad grey-green leaves;&#10;trampling among heaps of rubbish, the ass treads upon green&#10;laurels, and rejoices over the rank thistles. From this spot,&#10;whence the eagles of Rome once flew abroad, whence they &#39;came, saw,&#10;and conquered,&#39; our door leads into a little mean house, built of&#10;clay between two pillars; the wild vine hangs like a mourning&#10;garland over the crooked window. An old woman and her little&#10;granddaughter live there: they rule now in the palace of the&#10;Caesars, and show to strangers the remains of its past glories. Of&#10;the splendid throne-hall only a naked wall yet stands, and a black&#10;cypress throws its dark shadow on the spot where the throne once&#10;stood. The dust lies several feet deep on the broken pavement; and&#10;the little maiden, now the daughter of the imperial palace, often&#10;sits there on her stool when the evening bells ring. The keyhole of&#10;the door close by she calls her turret window; through this she can&#10;see half Rome, as far as the mighty cupola of St.&#10;Peter&#39;s.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;On this evening, as usual, stillness reigned around; and&#10;in the full beam of my light came the little granddaughter. On her&#10;head she carried an earthen pitcher of antique shape filled with&#10;water. Her feet were bare, her short frock and her white sleeves&#10;were torn. I kissed her pretty round shoulders, her dark eyes, and&#10;black shining hair. She mounted the stairs; they were steep, having&#10;been made up of rough blocks of broken marble and the capital of a&#10;fallen pillar. The coloured lizards slipped away, startled, from&#10;before her feet, but she was not frightened at them. Already she&#10;lifted her hand to pull the door-bell&#8212;a hare&#39;s foot fastened to a&#10;string formed the bell-handle of the imperial palace. She paused&#10;for a moment&#8212;of what might she be thinking? Perhaps of the&#10;beautiful Christ-child, dressed in gold and silver, which was down&#10;below in the chapel, where the silver candlesticks gleamed so&#10;bright, and where her little friends sung the hymns in which she&#10;also could join? I know not. Presently she moved again&#8212;she&#10;stumbled: the earthen vessel fell from her head, and broke on the&#10;marble steps. She burst into tears. The beautiful daughter of the&#10;imperial palace wept over the worthless broken pitcher; with her&#10;bare feet she stood there weeping; and dared not pull the string,&#10;the bell-rope of the imperial palace!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')

On the margin&#10;of the sandy desert, in a salt plain, that shone like a frozen&#10;lake, and was only covered in spots with light drifting sand, a&#10;halt was made. The eldest of the company&#8212;the water gourd hung at&#10;his girdle, and on his head was a little bag of unleavened&#10;bread&#8212;drew a square in the sand with his staff, and wrote in it a&#10;few words out of the Koran, and then the whole caravan passed over&#10;the consecrated spot. A young merchant, a child of the East, as I&#10;could tell by his eye and his figure, rode pensively forward on his&#10;white snorting steed. Was he thinking, perchance, of his fair young&#10;wife? It was only two days ago that the camel, adorned with furs&#10;and with costly shawls, had carried her, the beauteous bride, round&#10;the walls of the city, while drums and cymbals had sounded, the&#10;women sang, and festive shots, of which the bridegroom fired the&#10;greatest number, resounded round the camel; and now he was&#10;journeying with the caravan across the desert.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;For many nights I followed the train. I saw them rest by&#10;the wellside among the stunted palms; they thrust the knife into&#10;the breast of the camel that had fallen, and roasted its flesh by&#10;the fire. My beams cooled the glowing sands, and showed them the&#10;black rocks, dead islands in the immense ocean of sand. No hostile&#10;tribes met them in their pathless route, no storms arose, no&#10;columns of sand whirled destruction over the journeying caravan. At&#10;home the beautiful wife prayed for her husband and her father. &#39;Are&#10;they dead?&#39; she asked of my golden crescent; &#39;Are they dead?&#39; she&#10;cried to my full disc. Now the desert lies behind them. This&#10;evening they sit beneath the lofty palm trees, where the crane&#10;flutters round them with its long wings, and the pelican watches&#10;them from the branches of the mimosa. The luxuriant herbage is&#10;trampled down, crushed by the feet of elephants. A troop of negroes&#10;are returning from a market in the interior of the land: the women,&#10;with copper buttons in their black hair, and decked out in clothes&#10;dyed with indigo, drive the heavily-laden oxen, on whose backs&#10;slumber the naked black children. A negro leads a young lion which&#10;he has brought, by a string. They approach the caravan; the young&#10;merchant sits pensive and motionless, thinking of his beautiful&#10;wife, dreaming, in the land of the blacks, of his white lily beyond&#10;the desert. He raises his head, and&#8212;&#34; But at this moment a cloud&#10;passed before the Moon, and then another.

The&#10;father and mother slept, but the little son was not asleep. I saw&#10;the flowered cotton curtains of the bed move, and the child peep&#10;forth. At first I thought he was looking at the great clock, which&#10;was gaily painted in red and green. At the top sat a cuckoo, below&#10;hung the heavy leaden weights, and the pendulum with the polished&#10;disc of metal went to and fro, and said &#39;tick, tick.&#39; But no, he&#10;was not looking at the clock, but at his mother&#39;s spinning wheel,&#10;that stood just underneath it. That was the boy&#39;s favourite piece&#10;of furniture, but he dared not touch it, for if he meddled with it&#10;he got a rap on the knuckles. For hours together, when his mother&#10;was spinning, he would sit quietly by her side, watching the&#10;murmuring spindle and the revolving wheel, and as he sat he thought&#10;of many things. Oh, if he might only turn the wheel himself! Father&#10;and mother were asleep; he looked at them, and looked at the&#10;spinning wheel, and presently a little naked foot peered out of the&#10;bed, and then a second foot, and then two little white legs. There&#10;he stood. He looked round once more, to see if father and mother&#10;were still asleep&#8212;yes, they slept; and now he crept softly, softly,&#10;in his short little nightgown, to the spinning wheel, and began to&#10;spin. The thread flew from the wheel, and the wheel whirled faster&#10;and faster. I kissed his fair hair and his blue eyes, it was such a&#10;pretty picture.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;At that moment the mother awoke. The curtain shook, she&#10;looked forth, and fancied she saw a gnome or some other kind of&#10;little spectre. &#39;In Heaven&#39;s name!&#39; she cried, and aroused her&#10;husband in a frightened way. He opened his eyes, rubbed them with&#10;his hands, and looked at the brisk little lad. &#39;Why, that is&#10;Bertel,&#39; said he. And my eye quitted the poor room, for I have so&#10;much to see. At the same moment I looked at the halls of the&#10;Vatican, where the marble gods are enthroned. I shone upon the&#10;group of the Laocoon; the stone seemed to sigh. I pressed a silent&#10;kiss on the lips of the Muses, and they seemed to stir and move.&#10;But my rays lingered longest about the Nile group with the colossal&#10;god. Leaning against the Sphinx, he lies there thoughtful and&#10;meditative, as if he were thinking on the rolling centuries; and&#10;little love-gods sport with him and with the crocodiles. In the&#10;horn of plenty sat with folded arms a little tiny love-god,&#10;contemplating the great solemn river-god, a true picture of the boy&#10;at the spinning wheel&#8212;the features were exactly the same. Charming&#10;and life-like stood the little marble form, and yet the wheel of&#10;the year has turned more than a thousand times since the time when&#10;it sprang forth from the stone. Just as often as the boy in the&#10;little room turned the spinning wheel had the great wheel murmured,&#10;before the age could again call forth marble gods equal to those he&#10;afterwards formed.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Years have passed since all this happened,&#34; the Moon went&#10;on to say. &#34;Yesterday I looked upon a bay on the eastern coast of&#10;Denmark. Glorious woods are there, and high trees, an old knightly&#10;castle with red walls, swans floating in the ponds, and in the&#10;background appears, among orchards, a little town with a church.&#10;Many boats, the crews all furnished with torches, glided over the&#10;silent expanse&#8212;but these fires had not been kindled for catching&#10;fish, for everything had a festive look. Music sounded, a song was&#10;sung, and in one of the boats the man stood erect to whom homage&#10;was paid by the rest, a tall sturdy man, wrapped in a cloak. He had&#10;blue eyes and long white hair. I knew him, and thought of the&#10;Vatican, and of the group of the Nile, and the old marble gods. I&#10;thought of the simple little room where little Bertel sat in his&#10;night-shirt by the spinning wheel. The wheel of time has turned,&#10;and new gods have come forth from the stone. From the boats there&#10;arose a shout: &#39;Hurrah, hurrah for Bertel Thorwaldsen!&#39;&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022')
