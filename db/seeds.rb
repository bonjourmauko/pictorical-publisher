Between the stream and the hut lay a&#10;big abandoned field, where cattle were pastured when the bayou&#10;supplied them with water enough. Through the woods that spread back&#10;into unknown regions the woman had drawn an imaginary line, and&#10;past this circle she never stepped. This was the form of her only&#10;mania.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She was now a large, gaunt black woman, past thirty-five. Her&#10;real name was Jacqueline, but every one on the plantation called&#10;her La Folle, because in childhood she had been frightened&#10;literally &#34;out of her senses,&#34; and had never wholly regained&#10;them.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was when there had been skirmishing and sharpshooting all day&#10;in the woods. Evening was near when P&#39;tit Maitre, black with powder&#10;and crimson with blood, had staggered into the cabin of&#10;Jacqueline&#39;s mother, his pursuers close at his heels. The sight had&#10;stunned her childish reason.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She dwelt alone in her solitary cabin, for the rest of the&#10;quarters had long since been removed beyond her sight and&#10;knowledge. She had more physical strength than most men, and made&#10;her patch of cotton and corn and tobacco like the best of them. But&#10;of the world beyond the bayou she had long known nothing, save what&#10;her morbid fancy conceived.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;People at Bellissime had grown used to her and her way, and they&#10;thought nothing of it. Even when &#34;Old Mis&#39;&#34; died, they did not&#10;wonder that La Folle had not crossed the bayou, but had stood upon&#10;her side of it, wailing and lamenting.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;P&#39;tit Maitre was now the owner of Bellissime. He was a&#10;middle-aged man, with a family of beautiful daughters about him,&#10;and a little son whom La Folle loved as if he had been her own. She&#10;called him Cheri, and so did every one else because she did.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;None of the girls had ever been to her what Cheri was. They had&#10;each and all loved to be with her, and to listen to her wondrous&#10;stories of things that always happened &#34;yonda, beyon&#39; de&#10;bayou.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But none of them had stroked her black hand quite as Cheri did,&#10;nor rested their heads against her knee so confidingly, nor fallen&#10;asleep in her arms as he used to do. For Cheri hardly did such&#10;things now, since he had become the proud possessor of a gun, and&#10;had had his black curls cut off.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;That summer&#8212;the summer Cheri gave La Folle two black curls tied&#10;with a knot of red ribbon&#8212;the water ran so low in the bayou that&#10;even the little children at Bellissime were able to cross it on&#10;foot, and the cattle were sent to pasture down by the river. La&#10;Folle was sorry when they were gone, for she loved these dumb&#10;companions well, and liked to feel that they were there, and to&#10;hear them browsing by night up to her own enclosure.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was Saturday afternoon, when the fields were deserted. The&#10;men had flocked to a neighboring village to do their week&#39;s&#10;trading, and the women were occupied with household affairs,&#8212;La&#10;Folle as well as the others. It was then she mended and washed her&#10;handful of clothes, scoured her house, and did her baking.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In this last employment she never forgot Cheri. To-day she had&#10;fashioned croquignoles of the most fantastic and alluring shapes&#10;for him. So when she saw the boy come trudging across the old field&#10;with his gleaming little new rifle on his shoulder, she called out&#10;gayly to him, &#34;Cheri! Cheri!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But Cheri did not need the summons, for he was coming straight&#10;to her. His pockets all bulged out with almonds and raisins and an&#10;orange that he had secured for her from the very fine dinner which&#10;had been given that day up at his father&#39;s house.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He was a sunny-faced youngster of ten. When he had emptied his&#10;pockets, La Folle patted his round red cheek, wiped his soiled&#10;hands on her apron, and smoothed his hair. Then she watched him as,&#10;with his cakes in his hand, he crossed her strip of cotton back of&#10;the cabin, and disappeared into the wood.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He had boasted of the things he was going to do with his gun out&#10;there.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You think they got plenty deer in the wood, La Folle?&#34; he had&#10;inquired, with the calculating air of an experienced hunter.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Non, non!&#34; the woman laughed. &#34;Don&#39;t you look fo&#39; no deer,&#10;Cheri. Dat&#39;s too big. But you bring La Folle one good fat squirrel&#10;fo&#39; her dinner to-morrow, an&#39; she goin&#39; be satisfi&#39;.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;One squirrel ain&#39;t a bite. I&#39;ll bring you mo&#39; &#39;an one, La&#10;Folle,&#34; he had boasted pompously as he went away.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When the woman, an hour later, heard the report of the boy&#39;s&#10;rifle close to the wood&#39;s edge, she would have thought nothing of&#10;it if a sharp cry of distress had not followed the sound.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She withdrew her arms from the tub of suds in which they had&#10;been plunged, dried them upon her apron, and as quickly as her&#10;trembling limbs would bear her, hurried to the spot whence the&#10;ominous report had come.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was as she feared. There she found Cheri stretched upon the&#10;ground, with his rifle beside him. He moaned piteously:&#8212; &#34;I&#39;m dead,&#10;La Folle! I&#39;m dead! I&#39;m gone!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Non, non!&#34; she exclaimed resolutely, as she knelt beside him.&#10;&#34;Put you&#39; arm &#39;roun&#39; La Folle&#39;s nake, Cheri. Dat&#39;s nuttin&#39;; dat&#10;goin&#39; be nuttin&#39;.&#34; She lifted him in her powerful arms.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Cheri had carried his gun muzzle-downward. He had stumbled,&#8212;he&#10;did not know how. He only knew that he had a ball lodged somewhere&#10;in his leg, and he thought that his end was at hand. Now, with his&#10;head upon the woman&#39;s shoulder, he moaned and wept with pain and&#10;fright.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh, La Folle! La Folle! it hurt so bad! I can&#39; stan&#39; it, La&#10;Folle!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Don&#39;t cry, mon bebe, mon bebe, mon Cheri!&#34; the woman spoke&#10;soothingly as she covered the ground with long strides. &#34;La Folle&#10;goin&#39; mine you; Doctor Bonfils goin&#39; come make mon Cheri well&#10;agin.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She had reached the abandoned field. As she crossed it with her&#10;precious burden, she looked constantly and restlessly from side to&#10;side. A terrible fear was upon her, &#8212;the fear of the world beyond&#10;the bayou, the morbid and insane dread she had been under since&#10;childhood.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When she was at the bayou&#39;s edge she stood there, and shouted&#10;for help as if a life depended upon it:&#8212; &#34;Oh, P&#39;tit Maitre! P&#39;tit&#10;Maitre! Venez donc! Au secours! Au secours!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;No voice responded. Cheri&#39;s hot tears were scalding her neck.&#10;She called for each and every one upon the place, and still no&#10;answer came.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She shouted, she wailed; but whether her voice remained unheard&#10;or unheeded, no reply came to her frenzied cries. And all the while&#10;Cheri moaned and wept and entreated to be taken home to his&#10;mother.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;La Folle gave a last despairing look around her. Extreme terror&#10;was upon her. She clasped the child close against her breast, where&#10;he could feel her heart beat like a muffled hammer. Then shutting&#10;her eyes, she ran suddenly down the shallow bank of the bayou, and&#10;never stopped till she had climbed the opposite shore.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She stood there quivering an instant as she opened her eyes.&#10;Then she plunged into the footpath through the trees.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She spoke no more to Cheri, but muttered constantly, &#34;Bon Dieu,&#10;ayez pitie La Folle! Bon Dieu, ayez pitie moi!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Instinct seemed to guide her. When the pathway spread clear and&#10;smooth enough before her, she again closed her eyes tightly against&#10;the sight of that unknown and terrifying world.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A child, playing in some weeds, caught sight of her as she&#10;neared the quarters. The little one uttered a cry of dismay.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;La Folle!&#34; she screamed, in her piercing treble. &#34;La Folle done&#10;cross de bayer!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Quickly the cry passed down the line of cabins.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yonda, La Folle done cross de bayou!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Children, old men, old women, young ones with infants in their&#10;arms, flocked to doors and windows to see this awe-inspiring&#10;spectacle. Most of them shuddered with superstitious dread of what&#10;it might portend. &#34;She totin&#39; Cheri!&#34; some of them shouted.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Some of the more daring gathered about her, and followed at her&#10;heels, only to fall back with new terror when she turned her&#10;distorted face upon them. Her eyes were bloodshot and the saliva&#10;had gathered in a white foam on her black lips.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Some one had run ahead of her to where P&#39;tit Maitre sat with his&#10;family and guests upon the gallery.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;P&#39;tit Maitre! La Folle done cross de bayou! Look her! Look her&#10;yonda totin&#39; Cheri!&#34; This startling intimation was the first which&#10;they had of the woman&#39;s approach.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She was now near at hand. She walked with long strides. Her eyes&#10;were fixed desperately before her, and she breathed heavily, as a&#10;tired ox.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At the foot of the stairway, which she could not have mounted,&#10;she laid the boy in his father&#39;s arms. Then the world that had&#10;looked red to La Folle suddenly turned black,&#8212;like that day she had&#10;seen powder and blood.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She reeled for an instant. Before a sustaining arm could reach&#10;her, she fell heavily to the ground.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When La Folle regained consciousness, she was at home again, in&#10;her own cabin and upon her own bed. The moon rays, streaming in&#10;through the open door and windows, gave what light was needed to&#10;the old black mammy who stood at the table concocting a tisane of&#10;fragrant herbs. It was very late.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Others who had come, and found that the stupor clung to her, had&#10;gone again. P&#39;tit Maitre had been there, and with him Doctor&#10;Bonfils, who said that La Folle might die.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But death had passed her by. The voice was very clear and steady&#10;with which she spoke to Tante Lizette, brewing her tisane there in&#10;a corner.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ef you will give me one good drink tisane, Tante Lizette, I&#10;b&#39;lieve I&#39;m goin&#39; sleep, me.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And she did sleep; so soundly, so healthfully, that old Lizette&#10;without compunction stole softly away, to creep back through the&#10;moonlit fields to her own cabin in the new quarters.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The first touch of the cool gray morning awoke La Folle. She&#10;arose, calmly, as if no tempest had shaken and threatened her&#10;existence but yesterday.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She donned her new blue cottonade and white apron, for she&#10;remembered that this was Sunday. When she had made for herself a&#10;cup of strong black coffee, and drunk it with relish, she quitted&#10;the cabin and walked across the old familiar field to the bayou&#39;s&#10;edge again.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She did not stop there as she had always done before, but&#10;crossed with a long, steady stride as if she had done this all her&#10;life.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When she had made her way through the brush and scrub&#10;cottonwood-trees that lined the opposite bank, she found herself&#10;upon the border of a field where the white, bursting cotton, with&#10;the dew upon it, gleamed for acres and acres like frosted silver in&#10;the early dawn.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;La Folle drew a long, deep breath as she gazed across the&#10;country. She walked slowly and uncertainly, like one who hardly&#10;knows how, looking about her as she went.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The cabins, that yesterday had sent a clamor of voices to pursue&#10;her, were quiet now. No one was yet astir at Bellissime. Only the&#10;birds that darted here and there from hedges were awake, and&#10;singing their matins.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When La Folle came to the broad stretch of velvety lawn that&#10;surrounded the house, she moved slowly and with delight over the&#10;springy turf, that was delicious beneath her tread.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She stopped to find whence came those perfumes that were&#10;assailing her senses with memories from a time far gone.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There they were, stealing up to her from the thousand blue&#10;violets that peeped out from green, luxuriant beds. There they&#10;were, showering down from the big waxen bells of the magnolias far&#10;above her head, and from the jessamine clumps around her.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There were roses, too, without number. To right and left palms&#10;spread in broad and graceful curves. It all looked like enchantment&#10;beneath the sparkling sheen of dew.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When La Folle had slowly and cautiously mounted the many steps&#10;that led up to the veranda, she turned to look back at the perilous&#10;ascent she had made. Then she caught sight of the river, bending&#10;like a silver bow at the foot of Bellissime. Exultation possessed&#10;her soul.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;La Folle rapped softly upon a door near at hand. Cheri&#39;s mother&#10;soon cautiously opened it. Quickly and cleverly she dissembled the&#10;astonishment she felt at seeing La Folle.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ah, La Folle! Is it you, so early?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oui, madame. I come ax how my po&#39; li&#39;le Cheri do, &#39;s&#10;mo&#39;nin&#39;.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;He is feeling easier, thank you, La Folle. Dr. Bonfils says it&#10;will be nothing serious. He&#39;s sleeping now. Will you come back when&#10;he awakes?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Non, madame. I&#39;m goin&#39; wait yair tell Cheri wake up.&#34; La Folle&#10;seated herself upon the topmost step of the veranda.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A look of wonder and deep content crept into her face as she&#10;watched for the first time the sun rise upon the new, the beautiful&#10;world beyond the bayou.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 6, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/342', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('Desiree&#39;s Baby'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;As the day was pleasant, Madame Valmonde drove over to L&#39;Abri to&#10;see Desiree and the baby.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It made her laugh to think of Desiree with a baby. Why, it&#10;seemed but yesterday that Desiree was little more than a baby&#10;herself; when Monsieur in riding through the gateway of Valmonde&#10;had found her lying asleep in the shadow of the big stone&#10;pillar.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The little one awoke in his arms and began to cry for &#34;Dada.&#34;&#10;That was as much as she could do or say. Some people thought she&#10;might have strayed there of her own accord, for she was of the&#10;toddling age. The prevailing belief was that she had been purposely&#10;left by a party of Texans, whose canvas-covered wagon, late in the&#10;day, had crossed the ferry that Coton Mais kept, just below the&#10;plantation. In time Madame Valmonde abandoned every speculation but&#10;the one that Desiree had been sent to her by a beneficent&#10;Providence to be the child of her affection, seeing that she was&#10;without child of the flesh. For the girl grew to be beautiful and&#10;gentle, affectionate and sincere,&#8212;the idol of Valmonde.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was no wonder, when she stood one day against the stone&#10;pillar in whose shadow she had lain asleep, eighteen years before,&#10;that Armand Aubigny riding by and seeing her there, had fallen in&#10;love with her. That was the way all the Aubignys fell in love, as&#10;if struck by a pistol shot. The wonder was that he had not loved&#10;her before; for he had known her since his father brought him home&#10;from Paris, a boy of eight, after his mother died there. The&#10;passion that awoke in him that day, when he saw her at the gate,&#10;swept along like an avalanche, or like a prairie fire, or like&#10;anything that drives headlong over all obstacles.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Monsieur Valmonde grew practical and wanted things well&#10;considered: that is, the girl&#39;s obscure origin. Armand looked into&#10;her eyes and did not care. He was reminded that she was nameless.&#10;What did it matter about a name when he could give her one of the&#10;oldest and proudest in Louisiana? He ordered the corbeille from&#10;Paris, and contained himself with what patience he could until it&#10;arrived; then they were married.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Madame Valmonde had not seen Desiree and the baby for four&#10;weeks. When she reached L&#39;Abri she shuddered at the first sight of&#10;it, as she always did. It was a sad looking place, which for many&#10;years had not known the gentle presence of a mistress, old Monsieur&#10;Aubigny having married and buried his wife in France, and she&#10;having loved her own land too well ever to leave it. The roof came&#10;down steep and black like a cowl, reaching out beyond the wide&#10;galleries that encircled the yellow stuccoed house. Big, solemn&#10;oaks grew close to it, and their thick-leaved, far-reaching&#10;branches shadowed it like a pall. Young Aubigny&#39;s rule was a strict&#10;one, too, and under it his negroes had forgotten how to be gay, as&#10;they had been during the old master&#39;s easy-going and indulgent&#10;lifetime.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The young mother was recovering slowly, and lay full length, in&#10;her soft white muslins and laces, upon a couch. The baby was beside&#10;her, upon her arm, where he had fallen asleep, at her breast. The&#10;yellow nurse woman sat beside a window fanning herself.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Madame Valmonde bent her portly figure over Desiree and kissed&#10;her, holding her an instant tenderly in her arms. Then she turned&#10;to the child.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;This is not the baby!&#34; she exclaimed, in startled tones. French&#10;was the language spoken at Valmonde in those days.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I knew you would be astonished,&#34; laughed Desiree, &#34;at the way&#10;he has grown. The little cochon de lait! Look at his legs, mamma,&#10;and his hands and fingernails,&#8212;real finger-nails. Zandrine had to&#10;cut them this morning. Isn&#39;t it true, Zandrine?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The woman bowed her turbaned head majestically, &#34;Mais si,&#10;Madame.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And the way he cries,&#34; went on Desiree, &#34;is deafening. Armand&#10;heard him the other day as far away as La Blanche&#39;s cabin.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Madame Valmonde had never removed her eyes from the child. She&#10;lifted it and walked with it over to the window that was lightest.&#10;She scanned the baby narrowly, then looked as searchingly at&#10;Zandrine, whose face was turned to gaze across the fields.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, the child has grown, has changed,&#34; said Madame Valmonde,&#10;slowly, as she replaced it beside its mother. &#34;What does Armand&#10;say?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Desiree&#39;s face became suffused with a glow that was happiness&#10;itself.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh, Armand is the proudest father in the parish, I believe,&#10;chiefly because it is a boy, to bear his name; though he says&#10;not,&#8212;that he would have loved a girl as well. But I know it isn&#39;t&#10;true. I know he says that to please me. And mamma,&#34; she added,&#10;drawing Madame Valmonde&#39;s head down to her, and speaking in a&#10;whisper, &#34;he hasn&#39;t punished one of them&#8212;not one of them&#8212;since baby&#10;is born. Even Negrillon, who pretended to have burnt his leg that&#10;he might rest from work&#8212;he only laughed, and said Negrillon was a&#10;great scamp. oh, mamma, I&#39;m so happy; it frightens me.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;What Desiree said was true. Marriage, and later the birth of his&#10;son had softened Armand Aubigny&#39;s imperious and exacting nature&#10;greatly. This was what made the gentle Desiree so happy, for she&#10;loved him desperately. When he frowned she trembled, but loved him.&#10;When he smiled, she asked no greater blessing of God. But Armand&#39;s&#10;dark, handsome face had not often been disfigured by frowns since&#10;the day he fell in love with her.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When the baby was about three months old, Desiree awoke one day&#10;to the conviction that there was something in the air menacing her&#10;peace. It was at first too subtle to grasp. It had only been a&#10;disquieting suggestion; an air of mystery among the blacks;&#10;unexpected visits from far-off neighbors who could hardly account&#10;for their coming. Then a strange, an awful change in her husband&#39;s&#10;manner, which she dared not ask him to explain. When he spoke to&#10;her, it was with averted eyes, from which the old love-light seemed&#10;to have gone out. He absented himself from home; and when there,&#10;avoided her presence and that of her child, without excuse. And the&#10;very spirit of Satan seemed suddenly to take hold of him in his&#10;dealings with the slaves. Desiree was miserable enough to die.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She sat in her room, one hot afternoon, in her peignoir,&#10;listlessly drawing through her fingers the strands of her long,&#10;silky brown hair that hung about her shoulders. The baby, half&#10;naked, lay asleep upon her own great mahogany bed, that was like a&#10;sumptuous throne, with its satin-lined half-canopy. One of La&#10;Blanche&#39;s little quadroon boys&#8212;half naked too&#8212;stood fanning the&#10;child slowly with a fan of peacock feathers. Desiree&#39;s eyes had&#10;been fixed absently and sadly upon the baby, while she was striving&#10;to penetrate the threatening mist that she felt closing about her.&#10;She looked from her child to the boy who stood beside him, and back&#10;again; over and over. &#34;Ah!&#34; It was a cry that she could not help;&#10;which she was not conscious of having uttered. The blood turned&#10;like ice in her veins, and a clammy moisture gathered upon her&#10;face.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She tried to speak to the little quadroon boy; but no sound&#10;would come, at first. When he heard his name uttered, he looked up,&#10;and his mistress was pointing to the door. He laid aside the great,&#10;soft fan, and obediently stole away, over the polished floor, on&#10;his bare tiptoes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She stayed motionless, with gaze riveted upon her child, and her&#10;face the picture of fright.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Presently her husband entered the room, and without noticing&#10;her, went to a table and began to search among some papers which&#10;covered it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Armand,&#34; she called to him, in a voice which must have stabbed&#10;him, if he was human. But he did not notice. &#34;Armand,&#34; she said&#10;again. Then she rose and tottered towards him. &#34;Armand,&#34; she panted&#10;once more, clutching his arm, &#34;look at our child. What does it&#10;mean? tell me.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He coldly but gently loosened her fingers from about his arm and&#10;thrust the hand away from him. &#34;Tell me what it means!&#34; she cried&#10;despairingly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It means,&#34; he answered lightly, &#34;that the child is not white;&#10;it means that you are not white.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A quick conception of all that this accusation meant for her&#10;nerved her with unwonted courage to deny it. &#34;It is a lie; it is&#10;not true, I am white! Look at my hair, it is brown; and my eyes are&#10;gray, Armand, you know they are gray. And my skin is fair,&#34; seizing&#10;his wrist. &#34;Look at my hand; whiter than yours, Armand,&#34; she&#10;laughed hysterically.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;As white as La Blanche&#39;s,&#34; he returned cruelly; and went away&#10;leaving her alone with their child.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When she could hold a pen in her hand, she sent a despairing&#10;letter to Madame Valmonde.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My mother, they tell me I am not white. Armand has told me I am&#10;not white. For God&#39;s sake tell them it is not true. You must know&#10;it is not true. I shall die. I must die. I cannot be so unhappy,&#10;and live.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The answer that came was brief:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My own Desiree: Come home to Valmonde; back to your mother who&#10;loves you. Come with your child.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When the letter reached Desiree she went with it to her&#10;husband&#39;s study, and laid it open upon the desk before which he&#10;sat. She was like a stone image: silent, white, motionless after&#10;she placed it there.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In silence he ran his cold eyes over the written words.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He said nothing. &#34;Shall I go, Armand?&#34; she asked in tones sharp&#10;with agonized suspense.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, go.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Do you want me to go?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, I want you to go.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He thought Almighty God had dealt cruelly and unjustly with him;&#10;and felt, somehow, that he was paying Him back in kind when he&#10;stabbed thus into his wife&#39;s soul. Moreover he no longer loved her,&#10;because of the unconscious injury she had brought upon his home and&#10;his name.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She turned away like one stunned by a blow, and walked slowly&#10;towards the door, hoping he would call her back.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Good-by, Armand,&#34; she moaned.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He did not answer her. That was his last blow at fate.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Desiree went in search of her child. Zandrine was pacing the&#10;sombre gallery with it. She took the little one from the nurse&#39;s&#10;arms with no word of explanation, and descending the steps, walked&#10;away, under the live-oak branches.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was an October afternoon; the sun was just sinking. Out in&#10;the still fields the negroes were picking cotton.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Desiree had not changed the thin white garment nor the slippers&#10;which she wore. Her hair was uncovered and the sun&#39;s rays brought a&#10;golden gleam from its brown meshes. She did not take the broad,&#10;beaten road which led to the far-off plantation of Valmonde. She&#10;walked across a deserted field, where the stubble bruised her&#10;tender feet, so delicately shod, and tore her thin gown to&#10;shreds.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She disappeared among the reeds and willows that grew thick&#10;along the banks of the deep, sluggish bayou; and she did not come&#10;back again.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Some weeks later there was a curious scene enacted at L&#39;Abri. In&#10;the centre of the smoothly swept back yard was a great bonfire.&#10;Armand Aubigny sat in the wide hallway that commanded a view of the&#10;spectacle; and it was he who dealt out to a half dozen negroes the&#10;material which kept this fire ablaze.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A graceful cradle of willow, with all its dainty furbishings,&#10;was laid upon the pyre, which had already been fed with the&#10;richness of a priceless layette. Then there were silk gowns, and&#10;velvet and satin ones added to these; laces, too, and embroideries;&#10;bonnets and gloves; for the corbeille had been of rare quality.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The last thing to go was a tiny bundle of letters; innocent&#10;little scribblings that Desiree had sent to him during the days of&#10;their espousal. There was the remnant of one back in the drawer&#10;from which he took them. But it was not Desiree&#39;s; it was part of&#10;an old letter from his mother to his father. He read it. She was&#10;thanking God for the blessing of her husband&#39;s love:&#8212;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But above all,&#34; she wrote, &#34;night and day, I thank the good God&#10;for having so arranged our lives that our dear Armand will never&#10;know that his mother, who adores him, belongs to the race that is&#10;cursed with the brand of slavery.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 6, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/342', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('A Respectable Woman'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mrs. Baroda was a little provoked to learn that her husband&#10;expected his friend, Gouvernail, up to spend a week or two on the&#10;plantation.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;They had entertained a good deal during the winter; much of the&#10;time had also been passed in New Orleans in various forms of mild&#10;dissipation. She was looking forward to a period of unbroken rest,&#10;now, and undisturbed tete-a-tete with her husband, when he informed&#10;her that Gouvernail was coming up to stay a week or two.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;This was a man she had heard much of but never seen. He had been&#10;her husband&#39;s college friend; was now a journalist, and in no sense&#10;a society man or &#34;a man about town,&#34; which were, perhaps, some of&#10;the reasons she had never met him. But she had unconsciously formed&#10;an image of him in her mind. She pictured him tall, slim, cynical;&#10;with eye-glasses, and his hands in his pockets; and she did not&#10;like him. Gouvernail was slim enough, but he wasn&#39;t very tall nor&#10;very cynical; neither did he wear eyeglasses nor carry his hands in&#10;his pockets. And she rather liked him when he first presented&#10;himself.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But why she liked him she could not explain satisfactorily to&#10;herself when she partly attempted to do so. She could discover in&#10;him none of those brilliant and promising traits which Gaston, her&#10;husband, had often assured her that he possessed. On the contrary,&#10;he sat rather mute and receptive before her chatty eagerness to&#10;make him feel at home and in face of Gaston&#39;s frank and wordy&#10;hospitality. His manner was as courteous toward her as the most&#10;exacting woman could require; but he made no direct appeal to her&#10;approval or even esteem.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Once settled at the plantation he seemed to like to sit upon the&#10;wide portico in the shade of one of the big Corinthian pillars,&#10;smoking his cigar lazily and listening attentively to Gaston&#39;s&#10;experience as a sugar planter.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;This is what I call living,&#34; he would utter with deep&#10;satisfaction, as the air that swept across the sugar field caressed&#10;him with its warm and scented velvety touch. It pleased him also to&#10;get on familiar terms with the big dogs that came about him,&#10;rubbing themselves sociably against his legs. He did not care to&#10;fish, and displayed no eagerness to go out and kill grosbecs when&#10;Gaston proposed doing so.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Gouvernail&#39;s personality puzzled Mrs. Baroda, but she liked him.&#10;Indeed, he was a lovable, inoffensive fellow. After a few days,&#10;when she could understand him no better than at first, she gave&#10;over being puzzled and remained piqued. In this mood she left her&#10;husband and her guest, for the most part, alone together. Then&#10;finding that Gouvernail took no manner of exception to her action,&#10;she imposed her society upon him, accompanying him in his idle&#10;strolls to the mill and walks along the batture. She persistently&#10;sought to penetrate the reserve in which he had unconsciously&#10;enveloped himself.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;When is he going&#8212;your friend?&#34; she one day asked her husband.&#10;&#34;For my part, he tires me frightfully.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Not for a week yet, dear. I can&#39;t understand; he gives you no&#10;trouble.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No. I should like him better if he did; if he were more like&#10;others, and I had to plan somewhat for his comfort and&#10;enjoyment.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Gaston took his wife&#39;s pretty face between his hands and looked&#10;tenderly and laughingly into her troubled eyes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;They were making a bit of toilet sociably together in Mrs.&#10;Baroda&#39;s dressing-room.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You are full of surprises, ma belle,&#34; he said to her. &#34;Even I&#10;can never count upon how you are going to act under given&#10;conditions.&#34; He kissed her and turned to fasten his cravat before&#10;the mirror.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Here you are,&#34; he went on, &#34;taking poor Gouvernail seriously&#10;and making a commotion over him, the last thing he would desire or&#10;expect.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Commotion!&#34; she hotly resented. &#34;Nonsense! How can you say such&#10;a thing? Commotion, indeed! But, you know, you said he was&#10;clever.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;So he is. But the poor fellow is run down by overwork now.&#10;That&#39;s why I asked him here to take a rest.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You used to say he was a man of ideas,&#34; she retorted,&#10;unconciliated. &#34;I expected him to be interesting, at least. I&#39;m&#10;going to the city in the morning to have my spring gowns fitted.&#10;Let me know when Mr. Gouvernail is gone; I shall be at my Aunt&#10;Octavie&#39;s.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;That night she went and sat alone upon a bench that stood&#10;beneath a live oak tree at the edge of the gravel walk.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She had never known her thoughts or her intentions to be so&#10;confused. She could gather nothing from them but the feeling of a&#10;distinct necessity to quit her home in the morning.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mrs. Baroda heard footsteps crunching the gravel; but could&#10;discern in the darkness only the approaching red point of a lighted&#10;cigar. She knew it was Gouvernail, for her husband did not smoke.&#10;She hoped to remain unnoticed, but her white gown revealed her to&#10;him. He threw away his cigar and seated himself upon the bench&#10;beside her; without a suspicion that she might object to his&#10;presence.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Your husband told me to bring this to you, Mrs. Baroda,&#34; he&#10;said, handing her a filmy, white scarf with which she sometimes&#10;enveloped her head and shoulders. She accepted the scarf from him&#10;with a murmur of thanks, and let it lie in her lap.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He made some commonplace observation upon the baneful effect of&#10;the night air at the season. Then as his gaze reached out into the&#10;darkness, he murmured, half to himself:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;`Night of south winds&#8212;night of the large few stars!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Still nodding night&#8212;&#39;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She made no reply to this apostrophe to the night, which,&#10;indeed, was not addressed to her.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Gouvernail was in no sense a diffident man, for he was not a&#10;self-conscious one. His periods of reserve were not constitutional,&#10;but the result of moods. Sitting there beside Mrs. Baroda, his&#10;silence melted for the time.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He talked freely and intimately in a low, hesitating drawl that&#10;was not unpleasant to hear. He talked of the old college days when&#10;he and Gaston had been a good deal to each other; of the days of&#10;keen and blind ambitions and large intentions. Now there was left&#10;with him, at least, a philosophic acquiescence to the existing&#10;order&#8212;only a desire to be permitted to exist, with now and then a&#10;little whiff of genuine life, such as he was breathing now.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Her mind only vaguely grasped what he was saying. Her physical&#10;being was for the moment predominant. She was not thinking of his&#10;words, only drinking in the tones of his voice. She wanted to reach&#10;out her hand in the darkness and touch him with the sensitive tips&#10;of her fingers upon the face or the lips. She wanted to draw close&#10;to him and whisper against his cheek&#8212;she did not care what&#8212;as she&#10;might have done if she had not been a respectable woman.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The stronger the impulse grew to bring herself near him, the&#10;further, in fact, did she draw away from him. As soon as she could&#10;do so without an appearance of too great rudeness, she rose and&#10;left him there alone.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Before she reached the house, Gouvernail had lighted a fresh&#10;cigar and ended his apostrophe to the night.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mrs. Baroda was greatly tempted that night to tell her&#10;husband&#8212;who was also her friend&#8212;of this folly that had seized her.&#10;But she did not yield to the temptation. Beside being a respectable&#10;woman she was a very sensible one; and she knew there are some&#10;battles in life which a human being must fight alone.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When Gaston arose in the morning, his wife had already departed.&#10;She had taken an early morning train to the city. She did not&#10;return till Gouvernail was gone from under her roof.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There was some talk of having him back during the summer that&#10;followed. That is, Gaston greatly desired it; but this desire&#10;yielded to his wife&#39;s strenuous opposition.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;However, before the year ended, she proposed, wholly from&#10;herself, to have Gouvernail visit them again. Her husband was&#10;surprised and delighted with the suggestion coming from her.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I am glad, chere amie, to know that you have finally overcome&#10;your dislike for him; truly he did not deserve it.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh,&#34; she told him, laughingly, after pressing a long, tender&#10;kiss upon his lips, &#34;I have overcome everything! you will see. This&#10;time I shall be very nice to him.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 6, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/342', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('The Kiss'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was still quite light out of doors, but inside with the&#10;curtains drawn and the smouldering fire sending out a dim,&#10;uncertain glow, the room was full of deep shadows.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Brantain sat in one of these shadows; it had overtaken him and&#10;he did not mind. The obscurity lent him courage to keep his eves&#10;fastened as ardently as he liked upon the girl who sat in the&#10;firelight.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She was very handsome, with a certain fine, rich coloring that&#10;belongs to the healthy brune type. She was quite composed, as she&#10;idly stroked the satiny coat of the cat that lay curled in her lap,&#10;and she occasionally sent a slow glance into the shadow where her&#10;companion sat. They were talking low, of indifferent things which&#10;plainly were not the things that occupied their thoughts. She knew&#10;that he loved her&#8212;a frank, blustering fellow without guile enough&#10;to conceal his feelings, and no desire to do so. For two weeks past&#10;he had sought her society eagerly and persistently. She was&#10;confidently waiting for him to declare himself and she meant to&#10;accept him. The rather insignificant and unattractive Brantain was&#10;enormously rich; and she liked and required the entourage which&#10;wealth could give her.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;During one of the pauses between their talk of the last tea and&#10;the next reception the door opened and a young man entered whom&#10;Brantain knew quite well. The girl turned her face toward him. A&#10;stride or two brought him to her side, and bending over her&#10;chair&#8212;before she could suspect his intention, for she did not&#10;realize that he had not seen her visitor&#8212;he pressed an ardent,&#10;lingering kiss upon her lips.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Brantain slowly arose; so did the girl arise, but quickly, and&#10;the newcomer stood between them, a little amusement and some&#10;defiance struggling with the confusion in his face.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I believe,&#34; stammered Brantain, &#34;I see that I have stayed too&#10;long. I&#8212;I had no idea&#8212;that is, I must wish you good-by.&#34; He was&#10;clutching his hat with both hands, and probably did not perceive&#10;that she was extending her hand to him, her presence of mind had&#10;not completely deserted her; but she could not have trusted herself&#10;to speak.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Hang me if I saw him sitting there, Nattie! I know it&#39;s deuced&#10;awkward for you. But I hope you&#39;ll forgive me this once&#8212;this very&#10;first break. Why, what&#39;s the matter?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Don&#39;t touch me; don&#39;t come near me,&#34; she returned angrily.&#10;&#34;What do you mean by entering the house without ringing?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I came in with your brother, as I often do,&#34; he answered&#10;coldly, in self-justification. &#34;We came in the side way. He went&#10;upstairs and I came in here hoping to find you. The explanation is&#10;simple enough and ought to satisfy you that the misadventure was&#10;unavoidable. But do say that you forgive me, Nathalie,&#34; he&#10;entreated, softening.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Forgive you! You don&#39;t know what you are talking about. Let me&#10;pass. It depends upon&#8212;a good deal whether I ever forgive you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At that next reception which she and Brantain had been talking&#10;about she approached the young man with a delicious frankness of&#10;manner when she saw him there.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Will you let me speak to you a moment or two, Mr. Brantain?&#34;&#10;she asked with an engaging but perturbed smile. He seemed extremely&#10;unhappy; but when she took his arm and walked away with him,&#10;seeking a retired corner, a ray of hope mingled with the almost&#10;comical misery of his expression. She was apparently very&#10;outspoken.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Perhaps I should not have sought this interview, Mr. Brantain;&#10;but&#8212;but, oh, I have been very uncomfortable, almost miserable since&#10;that little encounter the other afternoon. When I thought how you&#10;might have misinterpreted it, and believed things&#34; &#8212;hope was&#10;plainly gaining the ascendancy over misery in Brantain&#39;s round,&#10;guileless face&#8212;&#34;Of course, I know it is nothing to you, but for my&#10;own sake I do want you to understand that Mr. Harvy is an intimate&#10;friend of long standing. Why, we have always been like cousins&#8212;like&#10;brother and sister, I may say. He is my brother&#39;s most intimate&#10;associate and often fancies that he is entitled to the same&#10;privileges as the family. Oh, I know it is absurd, uncalled for, to&#10;tell you this; undignified even,&#34; she was almost weeping, &#34;but it&#10;makes so much difference to me what you think of&#8212;of me.&#34; Her voice&#10;had grown very low and agitated. The misery had all disappeared&#10;from Brantain&#39;s face.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Then you do really care what I think, Miss Nathalie? May I call&#10;you Miss Nathalie?&#34; They turned into a long, dim corridor that was&#10;lined on either side with tall, graceful plants. They walked slowly&#10;to the very end of it. When they turned to retrace their steps&#10;Brantain&#39;s face was radiant and hers was triumphant.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Harvy was among the guests at the wedding; and he sought her out&#10;in a rare moment when she stood alone.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Your husband,&#34; he said, smiling, &#34;has sent me over to kiss you.&#10;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A quick blush suffused her face and round polished throat. &#34;I&#10;suppose it&#39;s natural for a man to feel and act generously on an&#10;occasion of this kind. He tells me he doesn&#39;t want his marriage to&#10;interrupt wholly that pleasant intimacy which has existed between&#10;you and me. I don&#39;t know what you&#39;ve been telling him,&#34; with an&#10;insolent smile, &#34;but he has sent me here to kiss you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She felt like a chess player who, by the clever handling of his&#10;pieces, sees the game taking the course intended. Her eyes were&#10;bright and tender with a smile as they glanced up into his; and her&#10;lips looked hungry for the kiss which they invited.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But, you know,&#34; he went on quietly, &#34;I didn&#39;t tell him so, it&#10;would have seemed ungrateful, but I can tell you. I&#39;ve stopped&#10;kissing women; it&#39;s dangerous.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Well, she had Brantain and his million left. A person can&#39;t have&#10;everything in this world; and it was a little unreasonable of her&#10;to expect it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 6, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/342', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('A Pair of Silk Stockings'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;Little Mrs. Sommers one day found herself the unexpected&#10;possessor of fifteen dollars. It seemed to her a very large amount&#10;of money, and the way in which it stuffed and bulged her worn old&#10;porte-monnaie gave her a feeling of importance such as she had not&#10;enjoyed for years.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The question of investment was one that occupied her greatly.&#10;For a day or two she walked about apparently in a dreamy state, but&#10;really absorbed in speculation and calculation. She did not wish to&#10;act hastily, to do anything she might afterward regret. But it was&#10;during the still hours of the night when she lay awake revolving&#10;plans in her mind that she seemed to see her way clearly toward a&#10;proper and judicious use of the money.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A dollar or two should be added to the price usually paid for&#10;Janie&#39;s shoes, which would insure their lasting an appreciable time&#10;longer than they usually did. She would buy so and so many yards of&#10;percale for new shirt waists for the boys and Janie and Mag. She&#10;had intended to make the old ones do by skilful patching. Mag&#10;should have another gown. She had seen some beautiful patterns,&#10;veritable bargains in the shop windows. And still there would be&#10;left enough for new stockings&#8212;two pairs apiece&#8212;and what darning&#10;that would save for a while! She would get caps for the boys and&#10;sailor-hats for the girls. The vision of her little brood looking&#10;fresh and dainty and new for once in their lives excited her and&#10;made her restless and wakeful with anticipation.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The neighbors sometimes talked of certain &#34;better days&#34; that&#10;little Mrs. Sommers had known before she had ever thought of being&#10;Mrs. Sommers. She herself indulged in no such morbid retrospection.&#10;She had no time&#8212;no second of time to devote to the past. The needs&#10;of the present absorbed her every faculty. A vision of the future&#10;like some dim, gaunt monster sometimes appalled her, but luckily&#10;to-morrow never comes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mrs. Sommers was one who knew the value of bargains; who could&#10;stand for hours making her way inch by inch toward the desired&#10;object that was selling below cost. She could elbow her way if need&#10;be; she had learned to clutch a piece of goods and hold it and&#10;stick to it with persistence and determination till her turn came&#10;to be served, no matter when it came.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But that day she was a little faint and tired. She had swallowed&#10;a light luncheon&#8212;no! when she came to think of it, between getting&#10;the children fed and the place righted, and preparing herself for&#10;the shopping bout, she had actually forgotten to eat any luncheon&#10;at all!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She sat herself upon a revolving stool before a counter that was&#10;comparatively deserted, trying to gather strength and courage to&#10;charge through an eager multitude that was besieging breastworks of&#10;shirting and figured lawn. An all-gone limp feeling had come over&#10;her and she rested her hand aimlessly upon the counter. She wore no&#10;gloves. By degrees she grew aware that her hand had encountered&#10;something very soothing, very pleasant to touch. She looked down to&#10;see that her hand lay upon a pile of silk stockings. A placard near&#10;by announced that they had been reduced in price from two dollars&#10;and fifty cents to one dollar and ninety-eight cents; and a young&#10;girl who stood behind the counter asked her if she wished to&#10;examine their line of silk hosiery. She smiled, just as if she had&#10;been asked to inspect a tiara of diamonds with the ultimate view of&#10;purchasing it. But she went on feeling the soft, sheeny luxurious&#10;things&#8212;with both hands now, holding them up to see them glisten,&#10;and to feel them glide serpent-like through her fingers.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Two hectic blotches came suddenly into her pale cheeks. She&#10;looked up at the girl.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Do you think there are any eights-and-a-half among these?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There were any number of eights-and-a-half. In fact, there were&#10;more of that size than any other. Here was a light-blue pair; there&#10;were some lavender, some all black and various shades of tan and&#10;gray. Mrs. Sommers selected a black pair and looked at them very&#10;long and closely. She pretended to be examining their texture,&#10;which the clerk assured her was excellent.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;A dollar and ninety-eight cents,&#34; she mused aloud. &#34;Well, I&#39;ll&#10;take this pair.&#34; She handed the girl a five-dollar bill and waited&#10;for her change and for her parcel. What a very small parcel it was!&#10;It seemed lost in the depths of her shabby old shopping-bag.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mrs. Sommers after that did not move in the direction of the&#10;bargain counter. She took the elevator, which carried her to an&#10;upper floor into the region of the ladies&#39; waiting-rooms. Here, in&#10;a retired corner, she exchanged her cotton stockings for the new&#10;silk ones which she had just bought. She was not going through any&#10;acute mental process or reasoning with herself, nor was she&#10;striving to explain to her satisfaction the motive of her action.&#10;She was not thinking at all. She seemed for the time to be taking a&#10;rest from that laborious and fatiguing function and to have&#10;abandoned herself to some mechanical impulse that directed her&#10;actions and freed her of responsibility.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;How good was the touch of the raw silk to her flesh! She felt&#10;like lying back in the cushioned chair and reveling for a while in&#10;the luxury of it. She did for a little while. Then she replaced her&#10;shoes, rolled the cotton stockings together and thrust them into&#10;her bag. After doing this she crossed straight over to the shoe&#10;department and took her seat to be fitted.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She was fastidious. The clerk could not make her out; he could&#10;not reconcile her shoes with her stockings, and she was not too&#10;easily pleased. She held back her skirts and turned her feet one&#10;way and her head another way as she glanced down at the polished,&#10;pointed-tipped boots. Her foot and ankle looked very pretty. She&#10;could not realize that they belonged to her and were a part of&#10;herself. She wanted an excellent and stylish fit, she told the&#10;young fellow who served her, and she did not mind the difference of&#10;a dollar or two more in the price so long as she got what she&#10;desired.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was a long time since Mrs. Sommers had been fitted with&#10;gloves. On rare occasions when she had bought a pair they were&#10;always &#34;bargains,&#34; so cheap that it would have been preposterous&#10;and unreasonable to have expected them to be fitted to the&#10;hand.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now she rested her elbow on the cushion of the glove counter,&#10;and a pretty, pleasant young creature, delicate and deft of touch,&#10;drew a long-wristed &#34;kid&#34; over Mrs. Sommers&#39;s hand. She smoothed it&#10;down over the wrist and buttoned it neatly, and both lost&#10;themselves for a second or two in admiring contemplation of the&#10;little symmetrical gloved hand. But there were other places where&#10;money might be spent.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There were books and magazines piled up in the window of a stall&#10;a few paces down the street. Mrs. Sommers bought two high-priced&#10;magazines such as she had been accustomed to read in the days when&#10;she had been accustomed to other pleasant things. She carried them&#10;without wrapping. As well as she could she lifted her skirts at the&#10;crossings. Her stockings and boots and well fitting gloves had&#10;worked marvels in her bearing&#8212;had given her a feeling of assurance,&#10;a sense of belonging to the well-dressed multitude.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She was very hungry. Another time she would have stilled the&#10;cravings for food until reaching her own home, where she would have&#10;brewed herself a cup of tea and taken a snack of anything that was&#10;available. But the impulse that was guiding her would not suffer&#10;her to entertain any such thought.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There was a restaurant at the corner. She had never entered its&#10;doors; from the outside she had sometimes caught glimpses of&#10;spotless damask and shining crystal, and soft-stepping waiters&#10;serving people of fashion.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When she entered her appearance created no surprise, no&#10;consternation, as she had half feared it might. She seated herself&#10;at a small table alone, and an attentive waiter at once approached&#10;to take her order. She did not want a profusion; she craved a nice&#10;and tasty bite&#8212;a half dozen blue-points, a plump chop with cress, a&#10;something sweet&#8212;a creme-frappee, for instance; a glass of Rhine&#10;wine, and after all a small cup of black coffee.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;While waiting to be served she removed her gloves very leisurely&#10;and laid them beside her. Then she picked up a magazine and glanced&#10;through it, cutting the pages with a blunt edge of her knife. It&#10;was all very agreeable. The damask was even more spotless than it&#10;had seemed through the window, and the crystal more sparkling.&#10;There were quiet ladies and gentlemen, who did not notice her,&#10;lunching at the small tables like her own. A soft, pleasing strain&#10;of music could be heard, and a gentle breeze, was blowing through&#10;the window. She tasted a bite, and she read a word or two, and she&#10;sipped the amber wine and wiggled her toes in the silk stockings.&#10;The price of it made no difference. She counted the money out to&#10;the waiter and left an extra coin on his tray, whereupon he bowed&#10;before her as before a princess of royal blood.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There was still money in her purse, and her next temptation&#10;presented itself in the shape of a matinee poster.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was a little later when she entered the theatre, the play had&#10;begun and the house seemed to her to be packed. But there were&#10;vacant seats here and there, and into one of them she was ushered,&#10;between brilliantly dressed women who had gone there to kill time&#10;and eat candy and display their gaudy attire. There were many&#10;others who were there solely for the play and acting. It is safe to&#10;say there was no one present who bore quite the attitude which Mrs.&#10;Sommers did to her surroundings. She gathered in the whole&#8212;stage&#10;and players and people in one wide impression, and absorbed it and&#10;enjoyed it. She laughed at the comedy and wept&#8212;she and the gaudy&#10;woman next to her wept over the tragedy. And they talked a little&#10;together over it. And the gaudy woman wiped her eyes and sniffled&#10;on a tiny square of filmy, perfumed lace and passed little Mrs.&#10;Sommers her box of candy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The play was over, the music ceased, the crowd filed out. It was&#10;like a dream ended. People scattered in all directions. Mrs.&#10;Sommers went to the corner and waited for the cable car.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A man with keen eyes, who sat opposite to her, seemed to like&#10;the study of her small, pale face. It puzzled him to decipher what&#10;he saw there. In truth, he saw nothing-unless he were wizard enough&#10;to detect a poignant wish, a powerful longing that the cable car&#10;would never stop anywhere, but go on and on with her forever.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 6, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/342', :deleted => 0)
