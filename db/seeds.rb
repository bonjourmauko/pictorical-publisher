Text.create(:title => coder.decode('The House of Mapuhi'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;Despite the heavy clumsiness of her lines, the Aorai handled&#10;easily in the light breeze, and her captain ran her well in before&#10;he hove to just outside the suck of the surf. The atoll of Hikueru&#10;lay low on the water, a circle of pounded coral sand a hundred&#10;yards wide, twenty miles in circumference, and from three to five&#10;feet above high-water mark. On the bottom of the huge and glassy&#10;lagoon was much pearl shell, and from the deck of the schooner,&#10;across the slender ring of the atoll, the divers could be seen at&#10;work. But the lagoon had no entrance for even a trading schooner.&#10;With a favoring breeze cutters could win in through the tortuous&#10;and shallow channel, but the schooners lay off and on outside and&#10;sent in their small boats.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Aorai swung out a boat smartly, into which sprang half a&#10;dozen brown-skinned sailors clad only in scarlet loincloths. They&#10;took the oars, while in the stern sheets, at the steering sweep,&#10;stood a young man garbed in the tropic white that marks the&#10;European. The golden strain of Polynesia betrayed itself in the&#10;sun-gilt of his fair skin and cast up golden sheens and lights&#10;through the glimmering blue of his eyes. Raoul he was, Alexandre&#10;Raoul, youngest son of Marie Raoul, the wealthy quarter-caste, who&#10;owned and managed half a dozen trading schooners similar to the&#10;Aorai. Across an eddy just outside the entrance, and in and through&#10;and over a boiling tide-rip, the boat fought its way to the&#10;mirrored calm of the lagoon. Young Raoul leaped out upon the white&#10;sand and shook hands with a tall native. The man&#39;s chest and&#10;shoulders were magnificent, but the stump of a right arm, beyond&#10;the flesh of which the age-whitened bone projected several inches,&#10;attested the encounter with a shark that had put an end to his&#10;diving days and made him a fawner and an intriguer for small&#10;favors.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Have you heard, Alec?&#34; were his first words. &#34;Mapuhi has found&#10;a pearl&#8212;such a pearl. Never was there one like it ever fished up in&#10;Hikueru, nor in all the Paumotus, nor in all the world. Buy it from&#10;him. He has it now. And remember that I told you first. He is a&#10;fool and you can get it cheap. Have you any tobacco?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Straight up the beach to a shack under a pandanus tree Raoul&#10;headed. He was his mother&#39;s supercargo, and his business was to&#10;comb all the Paumotus for the wealth of copra, shell, and pearls&#10;that they yielded up.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He was a young supercargo, it was his second voyage in such&#10;capacity, and he suffered much secret worry from his lack of&#10;experience in pricing pearls. But when Mapuhi exposed the pearl to&#10;his sight he managed to suppress the startle it gave him, and to&#10;maintain a careless, commercial expression on his face. For the&#10;pearl had struck him a blow. It was large as a pigeon egg, a&#10;perfect sphere, of a whiteness that reflected opalescent lights&#10;from all colors about it. It was alive. Never had he seen anything&#10;like it. When Mapuhi dropped it into his hand he was surprised by&#10;the weight of it. That showed that it was a good pearl. He examined&#10;it closely, through a pocket magnifying glass. It was without flaw&#10;or blemish. The purity of it seemed almost to melt into the&#10;atmosphere out of his hand. In the shade it was softly luminous,&#10;gleaming like a tender moon. So translucently white was it, that&#10;when he dropped it into a glass of water he had difficulty in&#10;finding it. So straight and swiftly had it sunk to the bottom that&#10;he knew its weight was excellent.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well, what do you want for it?&#34; he asked, with a fine&#10;assumption of nonchalance.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I want&#8212;&#34; Mapuhi began, and behind him, framing his own dark&#10;face, the dark faces of two women and a girl nodded concurrence in&#10;what he wanted. Their heads were bent forward, they were animated&#10;by a suppressed eagerness, their eyes flashed avariciously.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I want a house,&#34; Mapuhi went on. &#34;It must have a roof of&#10;galvanized iron and an octagon-drop-clock. It must be six fathoms&#10;long with a porch all around. A big room must be in the centre,&#10;with a round table in the middle of it and the octagon-drop-clock&#10;on the wall. There must be four bedrooms, two on each side of the&#10;big room, and in each bedroom must be an iron bed, two chairs, and&#10;a washstand. And back of the house must be a kitchen, a good&#10;kitchen, with pots and pans and a stove. And you must build the&#10;house on my island, which is Fakarava.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Is that all?&#34; Raoul asked incredulously.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;There must be a sewing machine,&#34; spoke up Tefara, Mapuhi&#39;s&#10;wife.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Not forgetting the octagon-drop-clock,&#34; added Nauri, Mapuhi&#39;s&#10;mother.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, that is all,&#34; said Mapuhi.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Young Raoul laughed. He laughed long and heartily. But while he&#10;laughed he secretly performed problems in mental arithmetic. He had&#10;never built a house in his life, and his notions concerning house&#10;building were hazy. While he laughed, he calculated the cost of the&#10;voyage to Tahiti for materials, of the materials themselves, of the&#10;voyage back again to Fakarava, and the cost of landing the&#10;materials and of building the house. It would come to four thousand&#10;French dollars, allowing a margin for safety&#8212;four thousand French&#10;dollars were equivalent to twenty thousad francs. It was&#10;impossible. How was he to know the value of such a pearl? Twenty&#10;thousand francs was a lot of money&#8212;and of his mother&#39;s money at&#10;that.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Mapuhi,&#34; he said, &#34;you are a big fool. Set a money price.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But Mapuhi shook his head, and the three heads behind him shook&#10;with his.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I want the house,&#34; he said. &#34;It must be six fathoms long with a&#10;porch all around&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, yes,&#34; Raoul interrupted. &#34;I know all about your house, but&#10;it won&#39;t do. I&#39;ll give you a thousand Chili dollars.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The four heads chorused a silent negative.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And a hundred Chili dollars in trade.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I want the house,&#34; Mapuhi began.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What good will the house do you?&#34; Raoul demanded. &#34;The first&#10;hurricane that comes along will wash it away. You ought to&#10;know.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Captain Raffy says it looks like a hurricane right now.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Not on Fakarava,&#34; said Mapuhi. &#34;The land is much higher there.&#10;On this island, yes. Any hurricane can sweep Hikueru. I will have&#10;the house on Fakarava. It must be six fathoms long with a porch all&#10;around&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And Raoul listened again to the tale of the house. Several hours&#10;he spent in the endeavor to hammer the house obsession out of&#10;Mapuhi&#39;s mind; but Mapuhi&#39;s mother and wife, and Ngakura, Mapuhi&#39;s&#10;daughter, bolstered him in his resolve for the house. Through the&#10;open doorway, while he listened for the twentieth time to the&#10;detailed description of the house that was wanted, Raoul saw his&#10;schooner&#39;s second boat draw up on the beach. The sailors rested on&#10;the oars, advertising haste to be gone. The first mate of the Aorai&#10;sprang ashore, exchanged a word with the one-armed native, then&#10;hurried toward Raoul. The day grew suddenly dark, as a squall&#10;obscured the face of the sun. Across the lagoon Raoul could see&#10;approaching the ominous line of the puff of wind.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Captain Raffy says you&#39;ve got to get to hell outa here,&#34; was&#10;the mate&#39;s greeting. &#34;If there&#39;s any shell, we&#39;ve got to run the&#10;risk of picking it up later on&#8212;so he says. The barometer&#39;s dropped&#10;to twenty-nine-seventy.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The gust of wind struck the pandanus tree overhead and tore&#10;through the palms beyond, flinging half a dozen ripe cocoanuts with&#10;heavy thuds to the ground. Then came the rain out of the distance,&#10;advancing with the roar of a gale of wind and causing the water of&#10;the lagoon to smoke in driven windrows. The sharp rattle of the&#10;first drops was on the leaves when Raoul sprang to his feet.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;A thousand Chili dollars, cash down, Mapuhi,&#34; he said. &#34;And two&#10;hundred Chili dollars in trade.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I want a house&#8212;&#34; the other began.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Mapuhi!&#34; Raoul yelled, in order to make himself heard. &#34;You are&#10;a fool!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He flung out of the house, and, side by side with the mate,&#10;fought his way down the beach toward the boat. They could not see&#10;the boat. The tropic rain sheeted about them so that they could see&#10;only the beach under their feet and the spiteful little waves from&#10;the lagoon that snapped and bit at the sand. A figure appeared&#10;through the deluge. It was Huru-Huru, the man with the one arm.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Did you get the pearl?&#34; he yelled in Raoul&#39;s ear.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Mapuhi is a fool!&#34; was the answering yell, and the next moment&#10;they were lost to each other in the descending water.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Half an hour later, Huru-Huru, watching from the seaward side of&#10;the atoll, saw the two boats hoisted in and the Aorai pointing her&#10;nose out to sea. And near her, just come in from the sea on the&#10;wings of the squall, he saw another schooner hove to and dropping a&#10;boat into the water. He knew her. It was the OROHENA, owned by&#10;Toriki, the half-caste trader, who served as his own supercargo and&#10;who doubtlessly was even then in the stern sheets of the boat.&#10;Huru-Huru chuckled. He knew that Mapuhi owed Toriki for trade goods&#10;advanced the year before.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The squall had passed. The hot sun was blazing down, and the&#10;lagoon was once more a mirror. But the air was sticky like&#10;mucilage, and the weight of it seemed to burden the lungs and make&#10;breathing difficult.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Have you heard the news, Toriki?&#34; Huru-Huru asked. &#34;Mapuhi has&#10;found a pearl. Never was there a pearl like it ever fished up in&#10;Hikueru, nor anywhere in the Paumotus, nor anywhere in all the&#10;world. Mapuhi is a fool. Besides, he owes you money. Remember that&#10;I told you first. Have you any tobacco?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And to the grass shack of Mapuhi went Toriki. He was a masterful&#10;man, withal a fairly stupid one. Carelessly he glanced at the&#10;wonderful pearl&#8212;glanced for a moment only; and carelessly he&#10;dropped it into his pocket.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You are lucky,&#34; he said. &#34;It is a nice pearl. I will give you&#10;credit on the books.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I want a house,&#34; Mapuhi began, in consternation. &#34;It must be&#10;six fathoms&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Six fathoms your grandmother!&#34; was the trader&#39;s retort. &#34;You&#10;want to pay up your debts, that&#39;s what you want. You owed me twelve&#10;hundred dollars Chili. Very well; you owe them no longer. The&#10;amount is squared. Besides, I will give you credit for two hundred&#10;Chili. If, when I get to Tahiti, the pearl sells well, I will give&#10;you credit for another hundred&#8212;that will make three hundred. But&#10;mind, only if the pearl sells well. I may even lose money on&#10;it.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mapuhi folded his arms in sorrow and sat with bowed head. He had&#10;been robbed of his pearl. In place of the house, he had paid a&#10;debt. There was nothing to show for the pearl.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You are a fool,&#34; said Tefara.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You are a fool,&#34; said Nauri, his mother. &#34;Why did you let the&#10;pearl into his hand?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What was I to do?&#34; Mapuhi protested. &#34;I owed him the money. He&#10;knew I had the pearl. You heard him yourself ask to see it. I had&#10;not told him. He knew. Somebody else told him. And I owed him the&#10;money.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Mapuhi is a fool,&#34; mimicked Ngakura.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She was twelve years old and did not know any better. Mapuhi&#10;relieved his feelings by sending her reeling from a box on the ear;&#10;while Tefara and Nauri burst into tears and continued to upbraid&#10;him after the manner of women.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Huru-Huru, watching on the beach, saw a third schooner that he&#10;knew heave to outside the entrance and drop a boat. It was the&#10;Hira, well named, for she was owned by Levy, the German Jew, the&#10;greatest pearl buyer of them all, and, as was well known, Hira was&#10;the Tahitian god of fishermen and thieves.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Have you heard the news?&#34; Huru-Huru asked, as Levy, a fat man&#10;with massive asymmetrical features, stepped out upon the beach.&#10;&#34;Mapuhi has found a pearl. There was never a pearl like it in&#10;Hikueru, in all the Paumotus, in all the world. Mapuhi is a fool.&#10;He has sold it to Toriki for fourteen hundred Chili&#8212;I listened&#10;outside and heard. Toriki is likewise a fool. You can buy it from&#10;him cheap. Remember that I told you first. Have you any&#10;tobacco?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Where is Toriki?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;In the house of Captain Lynch, drinking absinthe. He has been&#10;there an hour.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And while Levy and Toriki drank absinthe and chaffered over the&#10;pearl, Huru-Huru listened and heard the stupendous price of&#10;twenty-five thousand francs agreed upon.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was at this time that both the OROHENA and the Hira, running&#10;in close to the shore, began firing guns and signalling&#10;frantically. The three men stepped outside in time to see the two&#10;schooners go hastily about and head off shore, dropping mainsails&#10;and flying jibs on the run in the teeth of the squall that heeled&#10;them far over on the whitened water. Then the rain blotted them&#10;out.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;They&#39;ll be back after it&#39;s over,&#34; said Toriki. &#34;We&#39;d better be&#10;getting out of here.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I reckon the glass has fallen some more,&#34; said Captain&#10;Lynch.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He was a white-bearded sea-captain, too old for service, who had&#10;learned that the only way to live on comfortable terms with his&#10;asthma was on Hikueru. He went inside to look at the barometer.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Great God!&#34; they heard him exclaim, and rushed in to join him&#10;at staring at a dial, which marked twenty-nine-twenty.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Again they came out, this time anxiously to consult sea and sky.&#10;The squall had cleared away, but the sky remained overcast. The two&#10;schooners, under all sail and joined by a third, could be seen&#10;making back. A veer in the wind induced them to slack off sheets,&#10;and five minutes afterward a sudden veer from the opposite quarter&#10;caught all three schooners aback, and those on shore could see the&#10;boom-tackles being slacked away or cast off on the jump. The sound&#10;of the surf was loud, hollow, and menacing, and a heavy swell was&#10;setting in. A terrible sheet of lightning burst before their eyes,&#10;illuminating the dark day, and the thunder rolled wildly about&#10;them.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Toriki and Levy broke into a run for their boats, the latter&#10;ambling along like a panic-stricken hippopotamus. As their two&#10;boats swept out the entrance, they passed the boat of the Aorai&#10;coming in. In the stern sheets, encouraging the rowers, was Raoul.&#10;Unable to shake the vision of the pearl from his mind, he was&#10;returning to accept Mapuhi&#39;s price of a house.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He landed on the beach in the midst of a driving thunder squall&#10;that was so dense that he collided with Huru-Huru before he saw&#10;him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Too late,&#34; yelled Huru-Huru. &#34;Mapuhi sold it to Toriki for&#10;fourteen hundred Chili, and Toriki sold it to Levy for twenty-five&#10;thousand francs. And Levy will sell it in France for a hundred&#10;thousand francs. Have you any tobacco?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Raoul felt relieved. His troubles about the pearl were over. He&#10;need not worry any more, even if he had not got the pearl. But he&#10;did not believe Huru-Huru. Mapuhi might well have sold it for&#10;fourteen hundred Chili, but that Levy, who knew pearls, should have&#10;paid twenty-five thousand francs was too wide a stretch. Raoul&#10;decided to interview Captain Lynch on the subject, but when he&#10;arrived at that ancient mariner&#39;s house, he found him looking&#10;wide-eyed at the barometer.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What do you read it?&#34; Captain Lynch asked anxiously, rubbing&#10;his spectables and staring again at the instrument.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Twenty-nine-ten,&#34; said Raoul. &#34;I have never seen it so low&#10;before.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I should say not!&#34; snorted the captain. &#34;Fifty years boy and&#10;man on all the seas, and I&#39;ve never seen it go down to that.&#10;Listen!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;They stood for a moment, while the surf rumbled and shook the&#10;house. Then they went outside. The squall had passed. They could&#10;see the Aorai lying becalmed a mile away and pitching and tossing&#10;madly in the tremendous seas that rolled in stately procession down&#10;out of the northeast and flung themselves furiously upon the coral&#10;shore. One of the sailors from the boat pointed at the mouth of the&#10;passage and shook his head. Raoul looked and saw a white anarchy of&#10;foam and surge.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I guess I&#39;ll stay with you tonight, Captain,&#34; he said; then&#10;turned to the sailor and told him to haul the boat out and to find&#10;shelter for himself and fellows.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Twenty-nine flat,&#34; Captain Lynch reported, coming out from&#10;another look at the barometer, a chair in his hand.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He sat down and stared at the spectacle of the sea. The sun came&#10;out, increasing the sultriness of the day, while the dead calm&#10;still held. The seas continued to increase in magnitude.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What makes that sea is what gets me,&#34; Raoul muttered&#10;petulantly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;There is no wind, yet look at it, look at that fellow&#10;there!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Miles in length, carrying tens of thousands of tons in weight,&#10;its impact shook the frail atoll like an earthquake. Captain Lynch&#10;was startled.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Gracious!&#34; he bellowed, half rising from his chair, then&#10;sinking back.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But there is no wind,&#34; Raoul persisted. &#34;I could understand it&#10;if there was wind along with it.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You&#39;ll get the wind soon enough without worryin&#39; for it,&#34; was&#10;the grim reply.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The two men sat on in silence. The sweat stood out on their skin&#10;in myriads of tiny drops that ran together, forming blotches of&#10;moisture, which, in turn, coalesced into rivulets that dripped to&#10;the ground. They panted for breath, the old man&#39;s efforts being&#10;especially painful. A sea swept up the beach, licking around the&#10;trunks of the cocoanuts and subsiding almost at their feet.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Way past high water mark,&#34; Captain Lynch remarked; &#34;and I&#39;ve&#10;been here eleven years.&#34; He looked at his watch. &#34;It is three&#10;o&#39;clock.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A man and woman, at their heels a motley following of brats and&#10;curs, trailed disconsolately by. They came to a halt beyond the&#10;house, and, after much irresolution, sat down in the sand. A few&#10;minutes later another family trailed in from the opposite&#10;direction, the men and women carrying a heterogeneous assortment of&#10;possessions. And soon several hundred persons of all ages and sexes&#10;were congregated about the captain&#39;s dwelling. He called to one new&#10;arrival, a woman with a nursing babe in her arms, and in answer&#10;received the information that her house had just been swept into&#10;the lagoon.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;This was the highest spot of land in miles, and already, in many&#10;places on either hand, the great seas were making a clean breach of&#10;the slender ring of the atoll and surging into the lagoon. Twenty&#10;miles around stretched the ring of the atoll, and in no place was&#10;it more than fifty fathoms wide. It was the height of the diving&#10;season, and from all the islands around, even as far as Tahiti, the&#10;natives had gathered.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;There are twelve hundred men, women, and children here,&#34; said&#10;Captain Lynch. &#34;I wonder how many will be here tomorrow&#10;morning.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But why don&#39;t it blow?&#8212;that&#39;s what I want to know,&#34; Raoul&#10;demanded.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Don&#39;t worry, young man, don&#39;t worry; you&#39;ll get your troubles&#10;fast enough.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Even as Captain Lynch spoke, a great watery mass smote the&#10;atoll.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The sea water churned about them three inches deep under the&#10;chairs. A low wail of fear went up from the many women. The&#10;children, with clasped hands, stared at the immense rollers and&#10;cried piteously. Chickens and cats, wading perturbedly in the&#10;water, as by common consent, with flight and scramble took refuge&#10;on the roof of the captain&#39;s house. A Paumotan, with a litter of&#10;new-born puppies in a basket, climbed into a cocoanut tree and&#10;twenty feet above the ground made the basket fast. The mother&#10;floundered about in the water beneath, whining and yelping.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And still the sun shone brightly and the dead calm continued.&#10;They sat and watched the seas and the insane pitching of the Aorai.&#10;Captain Lynch gazed at the huge mountains of water sweeping in&#10;until he could gaze no more. He covered his face with his hands to&#10;shut out the sight; then went into the house.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Twenty-eight-sixty,&#34; he said quietly when he returned.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In his arm was a coil of small rope. He cut it into two-fathom&#10;lengths, giving one to Raoul and, retaining one for himself,&#10;distributed the remainder among the women with the advice to pick&#10;out a tree and climb.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A light air began to blow out of the northeast, and the fan of&#10;it on his cheek seemed to cheer Raoul up. He could see the Aorai&#10;trimming her sheets and heading off shore, and he regretted that he&#10;was not on her. She would get away at any rate, but as for the&#10;atoll&#8212;A sea breached across, almost sweeping him off his feet, and&#10;he selected a tree. Then he remembered the barometer and ran back&#10;to the house. He encountered Captain Lynch on the same errand and&#10;together they went in.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Twenty-eight-twenty,&#34; said the old mariner. &#34;It&#39;s going to be&#10;fair hell around here&#8212;what was that?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The air seemed filled with the rush of something. The house&#10;quivered and vibrated, and they heard the thrumming of a mighty&#10;note of sound. The windows rattled. Two panes crashed; a draught of&#10;wind tore in, striking them and making them stagger. The door&#10;opposite banged shut, shattering the latch. The white door knob&#10;crumbled in fragments to the floor. The room&#39;s walls bulged like a&#10;gas balloon in the process of sudden inflation. Then came a new&#10;sound like the rattle of musketry, as the spray from a sea struck&#10;the wall of the house. Captain Lyncyh looked at his watch. It was&#10;four o&#39;clock. He put on a coat of pilot cloth, unhooked the&#10;barometer, and stowed it away in a capacious pocket. Again a sea&#10;struck the house, with a heavy thud, and the light building tilted,&#10;twisted, quarter around on its foundation, and sank down, its floor&#10;at an angle of ten degrees.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Raoul went out first. The wind caught him and whirled him away.&#10;He noted that it had hauled around to the east. With a great effort&#10;he threw himself on the sand, crouching and holding his own.&#10;Captain Lynch, driven like a wisp of straw, sprawled over him. Two&#10;of the Aorai&#39;S sailors, leaving a cocoanut tree to which they had&#10;been clinging, came to their aid, leaning against the wind at&#10;impossible angles and fighting and clawing every inch of the&#10;way.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The old man&#39;s joints were stiff and he could not climb, so the&#10;sailors, by means of short ends of rope tied together, hoisted him&#10;up the trunk, a few feet at a time, till they could make him fast,&#10;at the top of the tree, fifty feet from the ground. Raoul passed&#10;his length of rope around the base of an adjacent tree and stood&#10;looking on. The wind was frightful. He had never dreamed it could&#10;blow so hard. A sea breached across the atoll, wetting him to the&#10;knees ere it subsided into the lagoon. The sun had disappeared, and&#10;a lead-colored twilight settled down. A few drops of rain, driving&#10;horizontally, struck him. The impact was like that of leaden&#10;pellets. A splash of salt spray struck his face. It was like the&#10;slap of a man&#39;s hand. His cheeks stung, and involuntary tears of&#10;pain were in his smarting eyes. Several hundred natives had taken&#10;to the trees, and he could have laughed at the bunches of human&#10;fruit clustering in the tops. Then, being Tahitian-born, he doubled&#10;his body at the waist, clasped the trunk of his tree with his&#10;hands, pressed the soles of his feet against the near surface of&#10;the trunk, and began to walk up the tree. At the top he found two&#10;women, two children, and a man. One little girl clasped a housecat&#10;in her arms.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;From his eyrie he waved his hand to Captain Lynch, and that&#10;doughty patriarch waved back. Raoul was appalled at the sky. It had&#10;approached much nearer&#8212;in fact, it seemed just over his head; and&#10;it had turned from lead to black. Many people were still on the&#10;ground grouped about the bases of the trees and holding on. Several&#10;such clusters were praying, and in one the Mormon missionary was&#10;exhorting. A weird sound, rhythmical, faint as the faintest chirp&#10;of a far cricket, enduring but for a moment, but in the moment&#10;suggesting to him vaguely the thought of heaven and celestial&#10;music, came to his ear. He glanced about him and saw, at the base&#10;of another tree, a large cluster of people holding on by ropes and&#10;by one another. He could see their faces working and their lips&#10;moving in unison. No sound came to him, but he knew that they were&#10;singing hymns.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Still the wind continued to blow harder. By no conscious process&#10;could he measure it, for it had long since passed beyond all his&#10;experience of wind; but he knew somehow, nevertheless, that it was&#10;blowing harder. Not far away a tree was uprooted, flinging its load&#10;of human beings to the ground. A sea washed across the strip of&#10;sand, and they were gone. Things were happening quickly. He saw a&#10;brown shoulder and a black head silhouetted against the churning&#10;white of the lagoon. The next instant that, too, had vanished.&#10;Other trees were going, falling and criss-crossing like matches. He&#10;was amazed at the power of the wind. His own tree was swaying&#10;perilously, one woman was wailing and clutching the little girl,&#10;who in turn still hung on to the cat.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The man, holding the other child, touched Raoul&#39;s arm and&#10;pointed. He looked and saw the Mormon church careering drunkenly a&#10;hundred feet away. It had been torn from its foundations, and wind&#10;and sea were heaving and shoving it toward the lagoon. A frightful&#10;wall of water caught it, tilted it, and flung it against half a&#10;dozen cocoanut trees. The bunches of human fruit fell like ripe&#10;cocoanuts. The subsiding wave showed them on the ground, some lying&#10;motionless, others squirming and writhing. They reminded him&#10;strangely of ants. He was not shocked. He had risen above horror.&#10;Quite as a matter of course he noted the succeeding wave sweep the&#10;sand clean of the human wreckage. A third wave, more colossal than&#10;any he had yet seen, hurled the church into the lagoon, where it&#10;floated off into the obscurity to leeward, half-submerged,&#10;reminding him for all the world of a Noah&#39;s ark.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He looked for Captain Lynch&#39;s house, and was surprised to find&#10;it gone. Things certainly were happening quickly. He noticed that&#10;many of the people in the trees that still held had descended to&#10;the ground. The wind had yet again increased. His own tree showed&#10;that. It no longer swayed or bent over and back. Instead, it&#10;remained practically stationary, curved in a rigid angle from the&#10;wind and merely vibrating. But the vibration was sickening. It was&#10;like that of a tuning-fork or the tongue of a jew&#39;s-harp. It was&#10;the rapidity of the vibration that made it so bad. Even though its&#10;roots held, it could not stand the strain for long. Something would&#10;have to break.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Ah, there was one that had gone. He had not seen it go, but&#10;there it stood, the remnant, broken off half-way up the trunk. One&#10;did not know what happened unless he saw it. The mere crashing of&#10;trees and wails of human despair occupied no place in that mighty&#10;volume of sound. He chanced to be looking in Captain Lynch&#39;s&#10;direction when it happened. He saw the trunk of the tree, half-way&#10;up, splinter and part without noise. The head of the tree, with&#10;three sailors of the Aorai and the old captain sailed off over the&#10;lagoon. It did not fall to the ground, but drove through the air&#10;like a piece of chaff. For a hundred yards he followed its flight,&#10;when it struck the water. He strained his eyes, and was sure that&#10;he saw Captain Lynch wave farewell.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Raoul did not wait for anything more. He touched the native and&#10;made signs to descend to the ground. The man was willing, but his&#10;women were paralayzed from terror, and he elected to remain with&#10;them. Raoul passed his rope around the tree and slid down. A rush&#10;of salt water went over his head. He held his breath and clung&#10;desperately to the rope. The water subsided, and in the shelter of&#10;the trunk he breathed once more. He fastened the rope more&#10;securely, and then was put under by another sea. One of the women&#10;slid down and joined him, the native remaining by the other woman,&#10;the two children, and the cat.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The supercargo had noticed how the groups clinging at the bases&#10;of the other trees continually diminished. Now he saw the process&#10;work out alongside him. It required all his strength to hold on,&#10;and the woman who had joined him was growing weaker. Each time he&#10;emerged from a sea he was surprised to find himself still there,&#10;and next, surprised to find the woman still there. At last he&#10;emerged to find himself alone. He looked up. The top of the tree&#10;had gone as well. At half its original height, a splintered end&#10;vibrated. He was safe. The roots still held, while the tree had&#10;been shorn of its windage. He began to climb up. He was so weak&#10;that he went slowly, and sea after sea caught him before he was&#10;above them. Then he tied himself to the trunk and stiffened his&#10;soul to face the night and he knew not what.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He felt very lonely in the darkness. At times it seemed to him&#10;that it was the end of the world and that he was the last one left&#10;alive. Still the wind increased. Hour after hour it increased. By&#10;what he calculated was eleven o&#39;clock, the wind had become&#10;unbelievable. It was a horrible, monstrous thing, a screaming fury,&#10;a wall that smote and passed on but that continued to smite and&#10;pass on&#8212;a wall without end. It seemed to him that he had become&#10;light and ethereal; that it was he that was in motion; that he was&#10;being driven with inconceivable velocity through unending&#10;solidness. The wind was no longer air in motion. It had become&#10;substantial as water or quicksilver. He had a feeling that he could&#10;reach into it and tear it out in chunks as one might do with the&#10;meat in the carcass of a steer; that he could seize hold of the&#10;wind and hang on to it as a man might hang on to the face of a&#10;cliff.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The wind strangled him. He could not face it and breathe, for it&#10;rushed in through his mouth and nostrils, distending his lungs like&#10;bladders. At such moments it seemed to him that his body was being&#10;packed and swollen with solid earth. Only by pressing his lips to&#10;the trunk of the tree could he breathe. Also, the ceaseless impact&#10;of the wind exhausted him. Body and brain became wearied. He no&#10;longer observed, no longer thought, and was but semiconscious. One&#10;idea constituted his consciousness: SO THIS WAS A HURRICANE. That&#10;one idea persisted irregularly. It was like a feeble flame that&#10;flickered occasionally. From a state of stupor he would return to&#10;it&#8212;SO THIS WAS A HURRICANE. Then he would go off into another&#10;stupor.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The height of the hurricane endured from eleven at night till&#10;three in the morning, and it was at eleven that the tree in which&#10;clung Mapuhi and his women snapped off. Mapuhi rose to the surface&#10;of the lagoon, still clutching his daughter Ngakura. Only a South&#10;Sea islander could have lived in such a driving smother. The&#10;pandanus tree, to which he attached himself, turned over and over&#10;in the froth and churn; and it was only by holding on at times and&#10;waiting, and at other times shifting his grips rapidly, that he was&#10;able to get his head and Ngakura&#39;s to the surface at intervals&#10;sufficiently near together to keep the breath in them. But the air&#10;was mostly water, what with flying spray and sheeted rain that&#10;poured along at right angles to the perpendicular.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was ten miles across the lagoon to the farther ring of sand.&#10;Here, tossing tree trunks, timbers, wrecks of cutters, and wreckage&#10;of houses, killed nine out of ten of the miserable beings who&#10;survived the passage of the lagoon. Half-drowned, exhausted, they&#10;were hurled into this mad mortar of the elements and battered into&#10;formless flesh. But Mapuhi was fortunate. His chance was the one in&#10;ten; it fell to him by the freakage of fate. He emerged upon the&#10;sand, bleeding from a score of wounds.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Ngakura&#39;s left arm was broken; the fingers of her right hand&#10;were crushed; and cheek and forehead were laid open to the bone. He&#10;clutched a tree that yet stood, and clung on, holding the girl and&#10;sobbing for air, while the waters of the lagoon washed by knee-high&#10;and at times waist-high.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At three in the morning the backbone of the hurricane broke. By&#10;five no more than a stiff breeze was blowing. And by six it was&#10;dead calm and the sun was shining. The sea had gone down. On the&#10;yet restless edge of the lagoon, Mapuhi saw the broken bodies of&#10;those that had failed in the landing. Undoubtedly Tefara and Nauri&#10;were among them. He went along the beach examining them, and came&#10;upon his wife, lying half in and half out of the water. He sat down&#10;and wept, making harsh animal noises after the manner of primitive&#10;grief. Then she stirred uneasily, and groaned. He looked more&#10;closely. Not only was she alive, but she was uninjured. She was&#10;merely sleeping. Hers also had been the one chance in ten.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Of the twelve hundred alive the night before but three hundred&#10;remained. The mormon missionary and a gendarme made the census. The&#10;lagoon was cluttered with corpses. Not a house nor a hut was&#10;standing. In the whole atoll not two stones remained one upon&#10;another. One in fifty of the cocoanut palms still stood, and they&#10;were wrecks, while on not one of them remained a single nut.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There was no fresh water. The shallow wells that caught the&#10;surface seepage of the rain were filled with salt. Out of the&#10;lagoon a few soaked bags of flour were recovered. The survivors cut&#10;the hearts out of the fallen cocoanut trees and ate them. Here and&#10;there they crawled into tiny hutches, made by hollowing out the&#10;sand and covering over with fragments of metal roofing. The&#10;missionary made a crude still, but he could not distill water for&#10;three hundred persons. By the end of the second day, Raoul, taking&#10;a bath in the lagoon, discovered that his thirst was somewhat&#10;relieved. He cried out the news, and thereupon three hundred men,&#10;women, and children could have been seen, standing up to their&#10;necks in the lagoon and trying to drink water in through their&#10;skins. Their dead floated about them, or were stepped upon where&#10;they still lay upon the bottom. On the third day the people buried&#10;their dead and sat down to wait for the rescue steamers.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In the meantime, Nauri, torn from her family by the hurricane,&#10;had been swept away on an adventure of her own. Clinging to a rough&#10;plank that wounded and bruised her and that filled her body with&#10;splinters, she was thrown clear over the atoll and carried away to&#10;sea. Here, under the amazing buffets of mountains of water, she&#10;lost her plank. She was an old woman nearly sixty; but she was&#10;Paumotan-born, and she had never been out of sight of the sea in&#10;her life. Swimming in the darkness, strangling, suffocating,&#10;fighting for air, she was struck a heavy blow on the shoulder by a&#10;cocoanut. On the instant her plan was formed, and she seized the&#10;nut. In the next hour she captured seven more. Tied together, they&#10;formed a life-buoy that preserved her life while at the same time&#10;it threatened to pound her to a jelly. She was a fat woman, and she&#10;bruised easily; but she had had experience of hurricanes, and while&#10;she prayed to her shark god for protection from sharks, she waited&#10;for the wind to break. But at three o&#39;clock she was in such a&#10;stupor that she did not know. Nor did she know at six o&#39;clock when&#10;the dead calm settled down. She was shocked into consciousness when&#10;she was thrown upon the sand. She dug in with raw and bleeding&#10;hands and feet and clawed against the backwash until she was beyond&#10;the reach of the waves.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She knew where she was. This land could be no other than the&#10;tiny islet of Takokota. It had no lagoon. No one lived upon it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Hikueru was fifteen miles away. She could not see Hikueru, but&#10;she knew that it lay to the south. The days went by, and she lived&#10;on the cocoanuts that had kept her afloat. They supplied her with&#10;drinking water and with food. But she did not drink all she wanted,&#10;nor eat all she wanted. Rescue was problematical. She saw the smoke&#10;of the rescue steamers on the horizon, but what steamer could be&#10;expected to come to lonely, uninhabited Takokota?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;From the first she was tormented by corpses. The sea persisted&#10;in flinging them upon her bit of sand, and she persisted, until her&#10;strength failed, in thrusting them back into the sea where the&#10;sharks tore at them and devoured them. When her strength failed,&#10;the bodies festooned her beach with ghastly horror, and she&#10;withdrew from them as far as she could, which was not far.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;By the tenth day her last cocoanut was gone, and she was&#10;shrivelling from thirst. She dragged herself along the sand,&#10;looking for cocoanuts. It was strange that so many bodies floated&#10;up, and no nuts. Surely, there were more cocoanuts afloat than dead&#10;men! She gave up at last, and lay exhausted. The end had come.&#10;Nothing remained but to wait for death.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Coming out of a stupor, she became slowly aware that she was&#10;gazing at a patch of sandy-red hair on the head of a corpse. The&#10;sea flung the body toward her, then drew it back. It turned over,&#10;and she saw that it had no face. Yet there was something familiar&#10;about that patch of sandy-red hair. An hour passed. She did not&#10;exert herself to make the identification. She was waiting to die,&#10;and it mattered little to her what man that thing of horror once&#10;might have been.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But at the end of the hour she sat up slowly and stared at the&#10;corpse. An unusually large wave had thrown it beyond the reach of&#10;the lesser waves. Yes, she was right; that patch of red hair could&#10;belong to but one man in the Paumotus. It was Levy, the German Jew,&#10;the man who had bought the pearl and carried it away on the Hira.&#10;Well, one thing was evident: The Hira had been lost. The pearl&#10;buyer&#39;s god of fishermen and thieves had gone back on him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She crawled down to the dead man. His shirt had been torn away,&#10;and she could see the leather money belt about his waist. She held&#10;her breath and tugged at the buckles. They gave easier than she had&#10;expected, and she crawled hurriedly away across the sand, dragging&#10;the belt after her. Pocket after pocket she unbuckled in the belt&#10;and found empty. Where could he have put it? In the last pocket of&#10;all she found it, the first and only pearl he had bought on the&#10;voyage. She crawled a few feet farther, to escape the pestilence of&#10;the belt, and examined the pearl. It was the one Mapuhi had found&#10;and been robbed of by Toriki. She weighed it in her hand and rolled&#10;it back and forth caressingly. But in it she saw no intrinsic&#10;beauty. What she did see was the house Mapuhi and Tefara and she&#10;had builded so carefully in their minds. Each time she looked at&#10;the pearl she saw the house in all its details, including the&#10;octagon-drop-clock on the wall. That was something to live for.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She tore a strip from her ahu and tied the pearl securely about&#10;her neck. Then she went on along the beach, panting and groaning,&#10;but resolutely seeking for cocoanuts. Quickly she found one, and,&#10;as she glanced around, a second. She broke one, drinking its water,&#10;which was mildewy, and eating the last particle of the meat. A&#10;little later she found a shattered dugout. Its outrigger was gone,&#10;but she was hopeful, and, before the day was out, she found the&#10;outrigger. Every find was an augury. The pearl was a talisman. Late&#10;in the afternoon she saw a wooden box floating low in the water.&#10;When she dragged it out on the beach its contents rattled, and&#10;inside she found ten tins of salmon. She opened one by hammering it&#10;on the canoe. When a leak was started, she drained the tin. After&#10;that she spent several hours in extracting the salmon, hammering&#10;and squeezing it out a morsel at a time.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Eight days longer she waited for rescue. In the meantime she&#10;fastened the outrigger back on the canoe, using for lashings all&#10;the cocoanut fibre she could find, and also what remained of her&#10;ahu. The canoe was badly cracked, and she could not make it&#10;water-tight; but a calabash made from a cocoanut she stored on&#10;board for a bailer. She was hard put for a paddle. With a piece of&#10;tin she sawed off all her hair close to the scalp. Out of the hair&#10;she braided a cord; and by means of the cord she lashed a&#10;three-foot piece of broom handle to a board from the salmon&#10;case.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She gnawed wedges with her teeth and with them wedged the&#10;lashing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;On the eighteenth day, at midnight, she launched the canoe&#10;through the surf and started back for Hikueru. She was an old&#10;woman. Hardship had stripped her fat from her till scarcely more&#10;than bones and skin and a few stringy muscles remained. The canoe&#10;was large and should have been paddled by three strong men.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But she did it alone, with a make-shift paddle. Also, the canoe&#10;leaked badly, and one-third of her time was devoted to bailing. By&#10;clear daylight she looked vainly for Hikueru. Astern, Takokota had&#10;sunk beneath the sea rim. The sun blazed down on her nakedness,&#10;compelling her body to surrender its moisture. Two tins of salmon&#10;were left, and in the course of the day she battered holes in them&#10;and drained the liquid. She had no time to waste in extracting the&#10;meat. A current was setting to the westward, she made westing&#10;whether she made southing or not.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In the eary afternoon, standing upright in the canoe, she&#10;sighted Hikueru Its wealth of cocoanut palms was gone. Only here&#10;and there, at wide intervals, could she see the ragged remnants of&#10;trees. The sight cheered her. She was nearer than she had thought.&#10;The current was setting her to the westward. She bore up against it&#10;and paddled on. The wedges in the paddle lashing worked loose, and&#10;she lost much time, at frequent intervals, in driving them tight.&#10;Then there was the bailing. One hour in three she had to cease&#10;paddling in order to bail. And all the time she driftd to the&#10;westward.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;By sunset Hikueru bore southeast from her, three miles away.&#10;There was a full moon, and by eight o&#39;clock the land was due east&#10;and two miles away. She struggled on for another hour, but the land&#10;was as far away as ever. She was in the main grip of the current;&#10;the canoe was too large; the paddle was too inadequate; and too&#10;much of her time and strength was wasted in bailing. Besides, she&#10;was very weak and growing weaker. Despite her efforts, the canoe&#10;was drifting off to the westward.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She breathed a prayer to her shark god, slipped over the side,&#10;and began to swim. She was actually refreshed by the water, and&#10;quickly left the canoe astern. At the end of an hour the land was&#10;perceptibly nearer. Then came her fright. Right before her eyes,&#10;not twenty feet away, a large fin cut the water. She swam steadily&#10;toward it, and slowly it glided away, curving off toward the right&#10;and circling around her. She kept her eyes on the fin and swam on.&#10;When the fin disappeared, she lay face downward in the water and&#10;watched. When the fin reappeared she resumed her swimming. The&#10;monster was lazy&#8212;she could see that. Without doubt he had been well&#10;fed since the hurricane. Had he been very hungry, she knew he would&#10;not have hesitated from making a dash for her. He was fifteen feet&#10;long, and one bite, she knew, could cut her in half.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But she did not have any time to waste on him. Whether she swam&#10;or not, the current drew away from the land just the same. A half&#10;hour went by, and the shark began to grow bolder. Seeing no harm in&#10;her he drew closer, in narrowing circles, cocking his eyes at her&#10;impudently as he slid past. Sooner or later, she knew well enough,&#10;he would get up sufficient courage to dash at her. She resolved to&#10;play first. It was a desperate act she meditated. She was an old&#10;woman, alone in the sea and weak from starvation and hardship; and&#10;yet she, in the face of this sea tiger, must anticipate his dash by&#10;herself dashing at him. She swam on, waiting her chance. At last he&#10;passed languidly by, barely eight feet away. She rushed at him&#10;suddenly, feigning that she was attacking him. He gave a wild flirt&#10;of his tail as he fled away, and his sandpaper hide, striking her,&#10;took off her skin from elbow to shoulder. He swam rapidly, in a&#10;widening circle, and at last disappeared.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In the hole in the sand, covered over by fragments of metal&#10;roofing, Mapuhi and Tefara lay disputing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;If you had done as I said,&#34; charged Tefara, for the thousandth&#10;time, &#34;and hidden the pearl and told no one, you would have it&#10;now.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But Huru-Huru was with me when I opened the shell&#8212;have I not&#10;told you so times and times and times without end?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And now we shall have no house. Raoul told me today that if you&#10;had not sold the pearl to Toriki&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I did not sell it. Toriki robbed me.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;&#8212;that if you had not sold the pearl, he would give you five&#10;thousand French dollars, which is ten thousand Chili.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;He has been talking to his mother,&#34; Mapuhi explained. &#34;She has&#10;an eye for a pearl.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And now the pearl is lost,&#34; Tefara complained.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It paid my debt with Toriki. That is twelve hundred I have&#10;made, anyway.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Toriki is dead,&#34; she cried. &#34;They have heard no word of his&#10;schooner. She was lost along with the Aorai and the Hira. Will&#10;Toriki pay you the three hundred credit he promised? No, because&#10;Toriki is dead. And had you found no pearl, would you today owe&#10;Toriki the twelve hundred? No, because Toriki is dead, and you&#10;cannot pay dead men.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But Levy did not pay Toriki,&#34; Mapuhi said. &#34;He gave him a piece&#10;of paper that was good for the money in Papeete; and now Levy is&#10;dead and cannot pay; and Toriki is dead and the paper lost with&#10;him, and the pearl is lost with Levy. You are right, Tefara. I have&#10;lost the pearl, and got nothing for it. Now let us sleep.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He held up his hand suddenly and listened. From without came a&#10;noise, as of one who breathed heavily and with pain. A hand fumbled&#10;against the mat that served for a door.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Who is there?&#34; Mapuhi cried.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Nauri,&#34; came the answer. &#34;Can you tell me where is my son,&#10;Mapuhi?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tefara screamed and gripped her husband&#39;s arm.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;A ghost! she chattered. &#34;A ghost!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mapuhi&#39;s face was a ghastly yellow. He clung weakly to his&#10;wife.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Good woman,&#34; he said in faltering tones, striving to disguise&#10;his vice, &#34;I know your son well. He is living on the east side of&#10;the lagoon.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;From without came the sound of a sigh. Mapuhi began to feel&#10;elated. He had fooled the ghost.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But where do you come from, old woman?&#34; he asked.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;From the sea,&#34; was the dejected answer.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I knew it! I knew it!&#34; screamed Tefara, rocking to and fro.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Since when has Tefara bedded in a strange house?&#34; came Nauri&#39;s&#10;voice through the matting.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mapuhi looked fear and reproach at his wife. It was her voice&#10;that had betrayed them.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And since when has Mapuhi, my son, denied his old mother?&#34; the&#10;voice went on.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No, no, I have not&#8212;Mapuhi has not denied you,&#34; he cried. &#34;I am&#10;not Mapuhi. He is on the east end of the lagoon, I tell you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Ngakura sat up in bed and began to cry. The matting started to&#10;shake.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What are you doing?&#34; Mapuhi demanded.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I am coming in,&#34; said the voice of Nauri.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;One end of the matting lifted. Tefara tried to dive under the&#10;blankets, but Mapuhi held on to her. He had to hold on to&#10;something. Together, struggling with each other, with shivering&#10;bodies and chattering teeth, they gazed with protruding eyes at the&#10;lifting mat. They saw Nauri, dripping with sea water, without her&#10;ahu, creep in. They rolled over backward from her and fought for&#10;Ngakura&#39;s blanket with which to cover their heads.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You might give your old mother a drink of water,&#34; the ghost&#10;said plaintively.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Give her a drink of water,&#34; Tefara commanded in a shaking&#10;voice.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Give her a drink of water,&#34; Mapuhi passed on the command to&#10;Ngakura.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And together they kicked out Ngakura from under the blanket. A&#10;minute later, peeping, Mapuhi saw the ghost drinking. When it&#10;reached out a shaking hand and laid it on his, he felt the weight&#10;of it and was convinced that it was no ghost. Then he emerged,&#10;dragging Tefara after him, and in a few minutes all were listening&#10;to Nauri&#39;s tale. And when she told of Levy, and dropped the pearl&#10;into Tefara&#39;s hand, even she was reconciled to the reality of her&#10;mother-in-law.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;In the morning,&#34; said Tefara, &#34;you will sell the pearl to Raoul&#10;for five thousand French.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The house?&#34; objected Nauri.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;He will build the house,&#34; Tefara answered. &#34;He ways it will&#10;cost four thousand French. Also will he give one thousand French in&#10;credit, which is two thousand Chili.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And it will be six fathoms long?&#34; Nauri queried.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ay,&#34; answered Mapuhi, &#34;six fathoms.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And in the middle room will be the octagon-drop-clock?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ay, and the round table as well.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Then give me something to eat, for I am hungry,&#34; said Nauri,&#10;complacently. &#34;And after that we will sleep, for I am weary. And&#10;tomorrow we will have more talk about the house before we sell the&#10;pearl. It will be better if we take the thousand French in cash.&#10;Money is ever better than credit in buying goods from the&#10;traders.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 9, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/1176', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('The Whale Tooth'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was in the early days in Fiji, when John Starhurst arose in&#10;the mission house at Rewa Village and announced his intention of&#10;carrying the gospel throughout all Viti Levu. Now Viti Levu means&#10;the &#34;Great Land,&#34; it being the largest island in a group composed&#10;of many large islands, to say nothing of hundreds of small ones.&#10;Here and there on the coasts, living by most precarious tenure, was&#10;a sprinkling of missionaries, traders, b&#710;che-de-mer fishers, and&#10;whaleship deserters. The smoke of the hot ovens arose under their&#10;windows, and the bodies of the slain were dragged by their doors on&#10;the way to the feasting.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Lotu, or the Worship, was progressing slowly, and, often, in&#10;crablike fashion. Chiefs, who announced themselves Christians and&#10;were welcomed into the body of the chapel, had a distressing habit&#10;of backsliding in order to partake of the flesh of some favorite&#10;enemy. Eat or be eaten had been the law of the land; and eat or be&#10;eaten promised to remain the law of the land for a long time to&#10;come. There were chiefs, such as Tanoa, Tuiveikoso, and&#10;Tuikilakila, who had literally eaten hundreds of their fellow men.&#10;But among these gluttons Ra Undreundre ranked highest. Ra&#10;Undreundre lived at Takiraki. He kept a register of his gustatory&#10;exploits. A row of stones outside his house marked the bodies he&#10;had eaten. This row was two hundred and thirty paces long, and the&#10;stones in it numbered eight hundred and seventy-two. Each stone&#10;represented a body. The row of stones might have been longer, had&#10;not Ra Undreundre unfortunately received a spear in the small of&#10;his back in a bush skirmish on Somo Somo and been served up on the&#10;table of Naungavuli, whose mediocre string of stones numbered only&#10;forty-eight.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The hard-worked, fever-stricken missionaries stuck doggedly to&#10;their task, at times despairing, and looking forward for some&#10;special manifestation, some outburst of Pentecostal fire that would&#10;bring a glorious harvest of souls. But cannibal Fiji had remained&#10;obdurate. The frizzle-headed man-eaters were loath to leave their&#10;fleshpots so long as the harvest of human carcases was plentiful.&#10;Sometimes, when the harvest was too plentiful, they imposed on the&#10;missionaries by letting the word slip out that on such a day there&#10;would be a killing and a barbecue. Promptly the missionaries would&#10;buy the lives of the victims with stick tobacco, fathoms of calico,&#10;and quarts of trade beads. Natheless the chiefs drove a handsome&#10;trade in thus disposing of their surplus live meat. Also, they&#10;could always go out and catch more.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was at this juncture that John Starhurst proclaimed that he&#10;would carry the Gospel from coast to coast of the Great Land, and&#10;that he would begin by penetrating the mountain fastnesses of the&#10;headwaters of the Rewa River. His words were received with&#10;consternation.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The native teachers wept softly. His two fellow missionaries&#10;strove to dissuade him. The King of Rewa warned him that the&#10;mountain dwellers would surely kai-kai him&#8212;kai-kai meaning &#34;to&#10;eat&#34;&#8212;and that he, the King of Rewa, having become Lotu, would be&#10;put to the necessity of going to war with the mountain dwellers.&#10;That he could not conquer them he was perfectly aware. That they&#10;might come down the river and sack Rewa Village he was likewise&#10;perfectly aware. But what was he to do? If John Starhurst persisted&#10;in going out and being eaten, there would be a war that would cost&#10;hundreds of lives.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Later in the day a deputation of Rewa chiefs waited upon John&#10;Starhurst. He heard them patiently, and argued patiently with them,&#10;though he abated not a whit from his purpose. To his fellow&#10;missionaries he explained that he was not bent upon martyrdom; that&#10;the call had come for him to carry the Gospel into Viti Levu, and&#10;that he was merely obeying the Lord&#39;s wish.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;To the traders who came and objected most strenuously of all, he&#10;said: &#34;Your objections are valueless. They consist merely of the&#10;damage that may be done your businesses. You are interested in&#10;making money, but I am interested in saving souls. The heathen of&#10;this dark land must be saved.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;John Starhurst was not a fanatic. He would have been the first&#10;man to deny the imputation. He was eminently sane and&#10;practical.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He was sure that his mission would result in good, and he had&#10;private visions of igniting the Pentecostal spark in the souls of&#10;the mountaineers and of inaugurating a revival that would sweep&#10;down out of the mountains and across the length and breadth of the&#10;Great Land from sea to sea and to the isles in the midst of the&#10;sea. There were no wild lights in his mild gray eyes, but only calm&#10;resolution and an unfaltering trust in the Higher Power that was&#10;guiding him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;One man only he found who approved of his project, and that was&#10;Ra Vatu, who secretly encouraged him and offered to lend him guides&#10;to the first foothills. John Starhurst, in turn, was greatly&#10;pleased by Ra Vatu&#39;s conduct. From an incorrigible heathen, with a&#10;heart as black as his practices, Ra Vatu was beginning to emanate&#10;light. He even spoke of becoming Lotu. True, three years before he&#10;had expressed a similar intention, and would have entered the&#10;church had not John Starhurst entered objection to his bringing his&#10;four wives along with him. Ra Vatu had had economic and ethical&#10;objections to monogamy. Besides, the missionary&#39;s hair-splitting&#10;objection had offended him; and, to prove that he was a free agent&#10;and a man of honor, he had swung his huge war club over Starhurst&#39;s&#10;head. Starhurst had escaped by rushing in under the club and&#10;holding on to him until help arrived. But all that was now forgiven&#10;and forgotten. Ra Vatu was coming into the church, not merely as a&#10;converted heathen, but as a converted polygamist as well. He was&#10;only waiting, he assured Starhurst, until his oldest wife, who was&#10;very sick, should die.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;John Starhurst journeyed up the sluggish Rewa in one of Ra&#10;Vatu&#39;s canoes. This canoe was to carry him for two days, when, the&#10;head of navigation reached, it would return. Far in the distance,&#10;lifted into the sky, could be seen the great smoky mountains that&#10;marked the backbone of the Great Land. All day John Starhurst gazed&#10;at them with eager yearning.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Sometimes he prayed silently. At other times he was joined in&#10;prayer by Narau, a native teacher, who for seven years had been&#10;Lotu, ever since the day he had been saved from the hot oven by Dr.&#10;James Ellery Brown at the trifling expense of one hundred sticks of&#10;tobacco, two cotton blankets, and a large bottle of painkiller. At&#10;the last moment, after twenty hours of solitary supplication and&#10;prayer, Narau&#39;s ears had heard the call to go forth with John&#10;Starhurst on the mission to the mountains.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Master, I will surely go with thee,&#34; he had announced.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;John Starhurst had hailed him with sober delight. Truly, the&#10;Lord was with him thus to spur on so broken-spirited a creature as&#10;Narau.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I am indeed without spirit, the weakest of the Lord&#39;s vessels,&#34;&#10;Narau explained, the first day in the canoe.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You should have faith, stronger faith,&#34; the missionary chided&#10;him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Another canoe journeyed up the Rewa that day. But it journeyed&#10;an hour astern, and it took care not to be seen. This canoe was&#10;also the property of Ra Vatu. In it was Erirola, Ra Vatu&#39;s first&#10;cousin and trusted henchman; and in the small basket that never&#10;left his hand was a whale tooth. It was a magnificent tooth, fully&#10;six inches long, beautifully proportioned, the ivory turned yellow&#10;and purple with age. This tooth was likewise the property of Ra&#10;Vatu; and in Fiji, when such a tooth goes forth, things usually&#10;happen. For this is the virtue of the whale tooth: Whoever accepts&#10;it cannot refuse the request that may accompany it or follow it.&#10;The request may be anything from a human life to a tribal alliance,&#10;and no Fijian is so dead to honor as to deny the request when once&#10;the tooth has been accepted. Sometimes the request hangs fire, or&#10;the fulfilment is delayed, with untoward consequences.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;High up the Rewa, at the village of a chief, Mongondro by name,&#10;John Starhurst rested at the end of the second day of the journey.&#10;In the morning, attended by Narau, he expected to start on foot for&#10;the smoky mountains that were now green and velvety with nearness.&#10;Mongondro was a sweet-tempered, mild-mannered little old chief,&#10;short-sighted and afflicted with elephantiasis, and no longer&#10;inclined toward the turbulence of war. He received the missionary&#10;with warm hospitality, gave him food from his own table, and even&#10;discussed religious matters with him. Mongondro was of an inquiring&#10;bent of mind, and pleased John Starhurst greatly by asking him to&#10;account for the existence and beginning of things. When the&#10;missionary had finished his summary of the Creation according to&#10;Genesis, he saw that Mongondro was deeply affected. The little old&#10;chief smoked silently for some time. Then he took the pipe from his&#10;mouth and shook his head sadly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It cannot be,&#34; he said. &#34;I, Mongondro, in my youth, was a good&#10;workman with the adze. Yet three months did it take me to make a&#10;canoe&#8212;a small canoe, a very small canoe. And you say that all this&#10;land and water was made by one man&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Nay, was made by one God, the only true God,&#34; the missinary&#10;interrupted.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It is the same thing,&#34; Mongondro went on, &#34;that all the land&#10;and all the water, the trees, the fish, and bush and mountains, the&#10;sun, the moon, and the stars, were made in six days! No, no. I tell&#10;you that in my youth I was an able man, yet did it require me three&#10;months for one small canoe. It is a story to frighten children&#10;with; but no man can believe it.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I am a man,&#34; the missionary said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;True, you are a man. But it is not given to my dark&#10;understanding to know what you believe.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I tell you, I do believe that everything was made in six&#10;days.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;So you say, so you say,&#34; the old cannibal murmured&#10;soothingly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was not until after John Starhurst and Narau had gone off to&#10;bed that Erirola crept into the chief&#39;s house, and, after&#10;diplomatic speech, handed the whale tooth to Mongondro.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The old chief held the tooth in his hands for a long time. It&#10;was a beautiful tooth, and he yearned for it. Also, he divined the&#10;request that must accompany it. &#34;No, no; whale teeth were&#10;beautiful,&#34; and his mouth watered for it, but he passed it back to&#10;Erirola with many apologies.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8230; &#38;#160;&#8230; &#38;#160;&#8230; &#38;#160;&#8230; . .&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In the early dawn John Starhurst was afoot, striding along the&#10;bush trail in his big leather boots, at his heels the faithful&#10;Narau, himself at the heels of a naked guide lent him by Mongondro&#10;to show the way to the next village, which was reached by midday.&#10;Here a new guide showed the way. A mile in the rear plodded&#10;Erirola, the whale tooth in the basket slung on his shoulder. For&#10;two days more he brought up the missionary&#39;s rear, offering the&#10;tooth to the village chiefs. But village after village refused the&#10;tooth. It followed so quickly the missionary&#39;s advent that they&#10;divined the request that would be made, and would have none of&#10;it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;They were getting deep into the mountains, and Erirola took a&#10;secret trail, cut in ahead of the missionary, and reached the&#10;stronghold of the Buli of Gatoka. Now the Buli was unaware of John&#10;Starhurst&#39;s imminent arrival. Also, the tooth was beautiful&#8212;an&#10;extraordinary specimen, while the coloring of it was of the rarest&#10;order. The tooth was presented publicly. The Buli of Gatoka, seated&#10;on his best mat, surrounded by his chief men, three busy&#10;fly-brushers at his back, deigned to receive from the hand of his&#10;herald the whale tooth presented by Ra Vatu and carried into the&#10;mountains by his cousin, Erirola. A clapping of hands went up at&#10;the acceptance of the present, the assembled headman, heralds, and&#10;fly-brushers crying aloud in chorus:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;A! woi! woi! woi! A! woi! woi! woi! A tabua levu! woi! woi! A&#10;mudua, mudua, mudua!&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Soon will come a man, a white man,&#34; Erirola began, after the&#10;proper pause. &#34;He is a missionary man, and he will come today. Ra&#10;Vatu is pleased to desire his boots. He wishes to present them to&#10;his good friend, Mongondro, and it is in his mind to send them with&#10;the feet along in them, for Mongondro is an old man and his teeth&#10;are not good. Be sure, O Buli, that the feet go along in the boots.&#10;As for the rest of him, it may stop here.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The delight in the whale tooth faded out of the Buli&#39;s eyes, and&#10;he glanced about him dubiously. Yet had he already accepted the&#10;tooth.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;A little thing like a missionary does not matter,&#34; Erirola&#10;prompted.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No, a little thing like a missionary does not matter,&#34; the Buli&#10;answered, himself again. &#34;Mongondro shall have the boots. Go, you&#10;young men, some three or four of you, and meet the missionary on&#10;the trail. Be sure you bring back the boots as well.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It is too late,&#34; said Erirola. &#34;Listen! He comes now.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Breaking through the thicket of brush, John Starhurst, with&#10;Narau close on his heels, strode upon the scene. The famous boots,&#10;having filled in wading the stream, squirted fine jets of water at&#10;every step. Starhurst looked about him with flashing eyes. Upborne&#10;by an unwavering trust, untouched by doubt or fear, he exulted in&#10;all he saw. He knew that since the beginning of time he was the&#10;first white man ever to tread the mountain stronghold of&#10;Gatoka.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The grass houses clung to the steep mountain side or overhung&#10;the rushing Rewa. On either side towered a mighty precipice. At the&#10;best, three hours of sunlight penetrated that narrow gorge. No&#10;cocoanuts nor bananas were to be seen, though dense, tropic&#10;vegetation overran everything, dripping in airy festoons from the&#10;sheer lips of the precipices and running riot in all the crannied&#10;ledges. At the far end of the gorge the Rewa leaped eight hundred&#10;feet in a single span, while the atmosphere of the rock fortress&#10;pulsed to the rhythmic thunder of the fall.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;From the Buli&#39;s house, John Starhurst saw emerging the Buli and&#10;his followers.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I bring you good tidings,&#34; was the missionary&#39;s greeting.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Who has sent you?&#34; the Buli rejoined quietly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;God.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It is a new name in Viti Levu,&#34; the Buli grinned. &#34;Of what&#10;islands, villages, or passes may he be chief?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;He is the chief over all islands, all villages, all passes,&#34;&#10;John Starhurst answered solemnly. &#34;He is the Lord over heaven and&#10;earth, and I am come to bring His word to you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Has he sent whale teeth?&#34; was the insolent query.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No, but more precious than whale teeth is the&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It is the custom, between chiefs, to send whale teeth,&#34; the&#10;Buli interrupted.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Your chief is either a niggard, or you are a fool, to come&#10;empty-handed into the mountains. Behold, a more generous than you&#10;is before you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So saying, he showed the whale tooth he had received from&#10;Erirola.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Narau groaned.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It is the whale tooth of Ra Vatu,&#34; he whispered to Starhurst.&#10;&#34;I know it well. Now are we undone.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;A gracious thing,&#34; the missionary answered, passing his hand&#10;through his long beard and adjusting his glasses. &#34;Ra Vatu has&#10;arranged that we should be well received.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But Narau groaned again, and backed away from the heels he had&#10;dogged so faithfully.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ra Vatu is soon to become Lotu,&#34; Starhurst explained, &#34;and I&#10;have come bringing the Lotu to you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I want none of your Lotu,&#34; said the Buli, proudly. &#34;And it is&#10;in my mind that you will be clubbed this day.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Buli nodded to one of his big mountaineers, who stepped&#10;forward, swinging a club. Narau bolted into the nearest house,&#10;seeking to hide among the woman and mats; but John Starhurst sprang&#10;in under the club and threw his arms around his executioner&#39;s neck.&#10;From this point of vantage he proceeded to argue. He was arguing&#10;for his life, and he knew it; but he was neither excited nor&#10;afraid.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It would be an evil thing for you to kill me,&#34; he told the man.&#10;&#34;I have done you no wrong, nor have I done the Buli wrong.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So well did he cling to the neck of the one man that they dared&#10;not strike with their clubs. And he continued to cling and to&#10;dispute for his life with those who clamored for his death.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I am John Starhurst,&#34; he went on calmly. &#34;I have labored in&#10;Fiji for three years, and I have done it for no profit. I am here&#10;among you for good. Why should any man kill me? To kill me will not&#10;profit any man.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Buli stole a look at the whale tooth. He was well paid for&#10;the deed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The missionary was surrounded by a mass of naked savages, all&#10;struggling to get at him. The death song, which is the song of the&#10;oven, was raised, and his expostulations could no longer be heard.&#10;But so cunningly did he twine and wreathe his body about his&#10;captor&#39;s that the death blow could not be struck. Erirola smiled,&#10;and the Buli grew angry.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Away with you!&#34; he cried. &#34;A nice story to go back to the&#10;coast&#8212;a dozen of you and one missionary, without weapons, weak as a&#10;woman, overcoming all of you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Wait, O Buli,&#34; John Starhurst called out from the thick of the&#10;scuffle, &#34;and I will overcome even you. For my weapons are Truth&#10;and Right, and no man can withstand them.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Come to me, then,&#34; the Buli answered, &#34;for my weapon is only a&#10;poor miserable club, and, as you say, it cannot withstand you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The group separated from him, and John Starhurst stood alone,&#10;facing the Buli, who was leaning on an enormous, knotted&#10;warclub.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Come to me, missionary man, and overcome me,&#34; the Buli&#10;challenged.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Even so will I come to you and overcome you,&#34; John Starhurst&#10;made answer, first wiping his spectacles and settling them&#10;properly, then beginning his advance.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Buli raised the club and waited.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;In the first place, my death will profit you nothing,&#34; began&#10;the argument.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I leave the answer to my club,&#34; was the Buli&#39;s reply.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And to every point he made the same reply, at the same time&#10;watching the missionary closely in order to forestall that cunning&#10;run-in under the lifted club. Then, and for the first time, John&#10;Starhurst knew that his death was at hand. He made no attempt to&#10;run in. Bareheaded, he stood in the sun and prayed aloud&#8212;the&#10;mysterious figure of the inevitable white man, who, with Bible,&#10;bullet, or rum bottle, has confronted the amazed savage in his&#10;every stronghold. Even so stood John Starhurst in the rock fortress&#10;of the Buli of Gatoka.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Forgive them, for they know not what they do,&#34; he prayed. &#34;O&#10;Lord! Have mercy upon Fiji. Have compasssion for Fiji. O Jehovah,&#10;hear us for His sake, Thy Son, whom Thou didst give that through&#10;Him all men might also become Thy children. From Thee we came, and&#10;our mind is that to Thee we may return. The land is dark, O Lord,&#10;the land is dark. But Thou art mighty to save. Reach out Thy hand,&#10;O Lord, and save Fiji, poor cannibal Fiji.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Buli grew impatient.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Now will I answer thee,&#34; he muttered, at the same time swinging&#10;his club with both hands.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Narau, hiding among the women and the mats, heard the impact of&#10;the blow and shuddered. Then the death song arose, and he knew his&#10;beloved missionary&#39;s body was being dragged to the oven as he heard&#10;the words:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Drag me gently. Drag me gently.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;For I am the champion of my land.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Give thanks! Give thanks! Give thanks!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Next, a single voice arose out of the din, asking:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Where is the brave man?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A hundred voices bellowed the answer:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Gone to be dragged into the oven and cooked.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Where is the coward?&#34; the single voice demanded.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Gone to report!&#34; the hundred voices bellowed back. &#34;Gone to&#10;report! Gone to report!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Narau groaned in anguish of spirit. The words of the old song&#10;were true. He was the coward, and nothing remained to him but to go&#10;and report.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 9, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/1176', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('Mauki'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;He weighed one hundred and ten pounds. His hair was kinky and&#10;negroid, and he was black. He was peculiarly black. He was neither&#10;blue-black nor purple-black, but plum-black. His name was Mauki,&#10;and he was the son of a chief. He had three tambos. Tambo is&#10;Melanesian for taboo, and is first cousin to that Polynesian word.&#10;Mauki&#39;s three tambos were as follows: First, he must never shake&#10;hands with a woman, nor have a woman&#39;s hand touch him or any of his&#10;personal belongings; secondly, he must never eat clams nor any food&#10;from a fire in which clams had been cooked; thirdly, he must never&#10;touch a crocodile, nor travel in a canoe that carried any part of a&#10;crocodile even if as large as a tooth.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Of a different black were his teeeth, which were deep black, or,&#10;perhaps better, LAMP-black. They had been made so in a single&#10;night, by his mother, who had compressed about them a powdered&#10;mineral which was dug from the landslide back of Port Adams. Port&#10;Adams is a salt-water village on Malaita, and Malaita is the most&#10;savage island in the Solomons&#8212;so savage that no traders or planters&#10;have yet gained a foothold on it; while, from the time of the&#10;earliest b&#710;che-de-mer fishers and sandalwood traders down to the&#10;latest labor recruiters equipped with automatic rifles and gasolene&#10;engines, scores of white adventurers have been passed out by&#10;tomahawks and soft-nosed Snider bullets. So Malaita remains today,&#10;in the twentieth century, the stamping ground of the labor&#10;recruiters, who farm its coasts for laborers who engage and&#10;contract themselves to toil on the plantations of the neighboring&#10;and more civilized islands for a wage of thirty dollars a year. The&#10;natives of those neighboring and more civilized islands have&#10;themselves become too civilized to work on plantations.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mauki&#39;s ears were pierced, not in one place, nor two places, but&#10;in a couple of dozen places. In one of the smaller holes he carried&#10;a clay pipe. The larger holes were too large for such use. The bowl&#10;of the pipe would have fallen through. In fact, in the largest hole&#10;in each ear he habitually wore round wooden plugs that were an even&#10;four inches in diameter. Roughly speaking, the circumference of&#10;said holes was twelve and one-half inches. Mauki was catholic in&#10;his tastes. In the various smaller holes he carried such things as&#10;empty rifle cartridges, horseshoe nails, copper screws, pieces of&#10;string, braids of sennit, strips of green leaf, and, in the cool of&#10;the day, scarlet hibiscus flowers. From which it will be seen that&#10;pockets were not necessary to his well-being. Besides, pockets were&#10;impossible, for his only wearing apparel consisted of a piece of&#10;calico several inches wide. A pocket knife he wore in his hair, the&#10;blade snapped down on a kinky lock. His most prized possession was&#10;the handle of a china cup, which he suspended from a ring of&#10;turtle-shell, which, in turn, was passed through the&#10;partition-cartilage of his nose.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But in spite of embellishments, Mauki had a nice face. It was&#10;really a pretty face, viewed by any standard, and for a Melanesian&#10;it was a remarkably good-looking face. Its one fault was its lack&#10;of strength. It was softly effeminate, almost girlish. The features&#10;were small, regular, and delicate. The chin was weak, and the mouth&#10;was weak. There was no strength nor character in the jaws,&#10;forehead, and nose. In the eyes only could be caught any hint of&#10;the unknown quantities that were so large a part of his make-up and&#10;that other persons could not understand. These unknown quantities&#10;were pluck, pertinacity, fearlessness, imagination, and cunning;&#10;and when they found expression in some consistent and striking&#10;action, those about him were astounded.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mauki&#39;s father was chief over the village at Port Adams, and&#10;thus, by birth a salt-water man, Mauki was half amphibian. He knew&#10;the way of the fishes and oysters, and the reef was an open book to&#10;him. Canoes, also, he knew. He learned to swim when he was a year&#10;old. At seven years he could hold his breath a full minute and swim&#10;straight down to bottom through thirty feet of water. And at seven&#10;years he was stolen by the bushmen, who cannot even swim and who&#10;are afraid of salt water. Thereafter Mauki saw the sea only from a&#10;distance, through rifts in the jungle and from open spaces on the&#10;high mountain sides. He became the slave of old Fanfoa, head chief&#10;over a score of scattered bush-villages on the range-lips of&#10;Malaita, the smoke of which, on calm mornings, is about the only&#10;evidence the seafaring white men have of the teeming interior&#10;population. For the whites do not penetrate Malaita. They tried it&#10;once, in the days when the search was on for gold, but they always&#10;left their heads behind to grin from the smoky rafters of the&#10;bushmen&#39;s huts.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When Mauki was a young man of seventeen, Fanfoa got out of&#10;tobacco. He got dreadfully out of tobacco. It was hard times in all&#10;his villages. He had been guilty of a mistake. Suo was a harbor so&#10;small that a large schooner could not swing at anchor in it. It was&#10;surrounded by mangroves that overhung the deep water. It was a&#10;trap, and into the trap sailed two white men in a small ketch. They&#10;were after recruits, and they possessed much tobacco and trade&#10;goods, to say nothing of three rifles and plenty of ammunition. Now&#10;there were no salt-water men living at Suo, and it was there that&#10;the bushmen could come down to the sea. The ketch did a splendid&#10;traffic. It signed on twenty recruits the first day. Even old&#10;Fanfoa signed on. And that same day the score of new recruits&#10;chopped off the two white men&#39;s head, killed the boat&#39;s crew, and&#10;burned the ketch. Thereafter, and for three months, there was&#10;tobacco and trade goods in plenty and to spare in all the bush&#10;villages. Then came the man-of-war that threw shells for miles into&#10;the hills, frightening the people out of their villages and into&#10;the deeper bush. Next the man-of-war sent landing parties ashore.&#10;The villages were all burned, along with the tobacco and trade&#10;stuff.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The cocoanuts and bananas were chopped down, the taro gardens&#10;uprooted, and the pigs and chickens killed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It taught Fanfoa a lesson, but in the meantime he was out of&#10;tobacco. Also, his young men were too frightened to sign on with&#10;the recruiting vessels. That was why Fanfoa ordered his slave,&#10;Mauki, to be carried down and signed on for half a case of tobacco&#10;advance, along with knives, axes, calico, and beads, which he would&#10;pay for with his toil on the plantations. Mauki was sorely&#10;frightened when they brought him on board the schooner. He was a&#10;lamb led to the slaughter. White men were ferocious creatures. They&#10;had to be, or else they would not make a practice of venturing&#10;along the Malaita coast and into all harbors, two on a schooner,&#10;when each schooner carried from fifteen to twenty blacks as boat&#39;s&#10;crew, and often as high as sixty or seventy black recruits. In&#10;addition to this, there was always the danger of the shore&#10;population, the sudden attack and the cutting off of the schooner&#10;and all hands. Truly, white men must be terrible. Besides, they&#10;were possessed of such devil-devils&#8212;rifles that shot very rapidly&#10;many times, things of iron and brass that made the schooners go&#10;when there was no wind, and boxes that talked and laughed just as&#10;men talked and laughed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Ay, and he had heard of one white man whose particular&#10;devil-devil was so powerful that he could take out all his teeth&#10;and put them back at will.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Down into the cabin they took Mauki. On deck, the one white man&#10;kept guard with two revolvers in his belt. In the cabin the other&#10;white man sat with a book before him, in which he inscribed strange&#10;marks and lines. He looked at Mauki as though he had been a pig or&#10;a fowl, glanced under the hollows of his arms, and wrote in the&#10;book. Then he held out the writing stick and Mauki just barely&#10;touched it with his hand, in so doing pledging himself to toil for&#10;three years on the plantations of the Moongleam Soap Company. It&#10;was not explained to him that the will of the ferocious white men&#10;would be used to enforce the pledge, and that, behind all, for the&#10;same use, was all the power and all the warships of Great&#10;Britain.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Other blacks there were on board, from unheard-of far places,&#10;and when the white man spoke to them, they tore the long feather&#10;from Mauki&#39;s hair, cut that same hair short, and wrapped about his&#10;waist a lava-lava of bright yellow calico.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;After many days on the schooner, and after beholding more land&#10;and islands than he had ever dreamed of, he was landed on New&#10;Georgia, and put to work in the field clearing jungle and cutting&#10;cane grass. For the first time he knew what work was. Even as a&#10;slave to Fanfoa he had not worked like this. And he did not like&#10;work. It was up at dawn and in at dark, on two meals a day. And the&#10;food was tiresome. For weeks at a time they were given nothing but&#10;sweet potatoes to eat, and for weeks at a time it would be nothing&#10;but rice. He cut out the cocoanut from the shells day after day;&#10;and for long days and weeks he fed the fires that smoked the copra,&#10;till his eyes got sore and he was set to felling trees. He was a&#10;good axe-man, and later he was put in the bridge-building gang.&#10;Once, he was punished by being put in the road-building gang. At&#10;times he served as boat&#39;s crew in the whale boats, when they&#10;brought in copra from distant beaches or when the white men went&#10;out to dynamite fish.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Among other things he learned beche-de-mer English, with which&#10;he could talk with all white men, and with all recruits who&#10;otherwise would have talked in a thousand different dialects. Also,&#10;he learned certain things about the white men, principally that&#10;they kept their word. If they told a boy he was going to receive a&#10;stick of tobacco, he got it. If they told a boy they would knock&#10;seven bells out of him if he did a certain thing, when he did that&#10;thing, seven bells invariably were knocked out of him. Mauki did&#10;not know what seven bells were, but they occurred in beche-de-mer,&#10;and he imagined them to be the blood and teeth that sometimes&#10;accompanied the process of knocking out seven bells. One other&#10;thing he learned: no boy was struck or punished unless he did&#10;wrong. Even when the white men were drunk, as they were frequently,&#10;they never struck unless a rule had been broken.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mauki did not like the plantation. He hated work, and he was the&#10;son of a chief. Furthermore, it was ten years since he had been&#10;stolen from Port Adams by Fanfoa, and he was homesick. He was even&#10;homesick for the slavery under Fanfoa. So he ran away. He struck&#10;back into the bush, with the idea of working southward to the beach&#10;and stealing a canoe in which to go home to Port Adams.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But the fever got him, and he was captured and brought back more&#10;dead than alive.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A second time he ran away, in the company of two Malaita boys.&#10;They got down the coast twenty miles, and were hidden in the hut of&#10;a Malaita freeman, who dwelt in that village. But in the dead of&#10;night two white men came, who were not afraid of all the village&#10;people and who knocked seven bells out of the three runaways, tied&#10;them like pigs, and tossed them into the whale boat. But the man in&#10;whose house they had hidden&#8212;seven times seven bells must have been&#10;knocked out of him from the way the hair, skin, and teeth flew, and&#10;he was discouraged for the rest of his natural life from harboring&#10;runaway laborers.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For a year Mauki toiled on. Then he was made a house-boy, and&#10;had good food and easy times, with light work in keeping the house&#10;clean and serving the white men with whiskey and beer at all hours&#10;of the day and most hours of the night. He liked it, but he liked&#10;Port Adams more. He had two years longer to serve, but two years&#10;were too long for him in the throes of homesickness. He had grown&#10;wiser with his year of service, and, being now a house-boy, he had&#10;opportunity. He had the cleaning of the rifles, and he knew where&#10;the key to the store room was hung. He planned to escape, and one&#10;night ten Malaita boys and one boy from San Cristoval sneaked from&#10;the barracks and dragged one of the whale boats down to the beach.&#10;It was Mauki who supplied the key that opened the padlock on the&#10;boat, and it was Mauki who equipped the boat with a dozen&#10;Winchesters, an immense amount of ammunition, a case of dynamite&#10;with detonators and fuse, and ten cases of tobacco.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The northwest monsoon was blowing, and they fled south in the&#10;night time, hiding by day on detached and uninhabited islets, or&#10;dragging their whale boat into the bush on the large islands. Thus&#10;they gained Guadalcanar, skirted halfway along it, and crossed the&#10;Indispensable Straits to Florida Island. It was here that they&#10;killed the San Cristoval boy, saving his head and cooking and&#10;eating the rest of him. The Malaita coast was only twenty miles&#10;away, but the last night a strong current and baffling winds&#10;prevented them from gaining across. Daylight found them still&#10;several miles from their goal. But daylight brought a cutter, in&#10;which were two white men, who were not afraid of eleven Malaita men&#10;armed with twelve rifles. Mauki and his companions were carried&#10;back to Tulagi, where lived the great white master of all the white&#10;men. And the great white master held a court, after which, one by&#10;one, the runaways were tied up and given twenty lashes each, and&#10;sentenced to a fine of fifteen dollars. They were sent back to New&#10;Georgia, where the white men knocked seven bells out of them all&#10;around and put them to work. But Mauki was no longer house-boy. He&#10;was put in the road-making gang. The fine of fifteen dollars had&#10;been paid by the white men from whom he had run away, and he was&#10;told that he would have to work it out, which meant six months&#39;&#10;additional toil. Further, his share of the stolen tobacco earned&#10;him another year of toil.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Port Adams was now three years and a half away, so he stole a&#10;canoe one night, hid on the islets in Manning Straits, passed&#10;through the Straits, and began working along the eastern coast of&#10;Ysabel, only to be captured, two-thirds of the way along, by the&#10;white men on Meringe Lagoon. After a week, he escaped from them and&#10;took to the bush. There were no bush natives on Ysabel, only&#10;salt-water men, who were all Christians. The white men put up a&#10;reward of five-hundred sticks of tobacco, and every time Mauki&#10;ventured down to the sea to steal a canoe he was chased by the&#10;salt-water men. Four months of this passed, when, the reward having&#10;been raised to a thousand sticks, he was caught and sent back to&#10;New Georgia and the road-building gang. Now a thousand sticks are&#10;worth fifty dollars, and Mauki had to pay the reward himself, which&#10;required a year and eight months&#39; labor. So Port Adams was now five&#10;years away.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;His homesickness was greater than ever, and it did not appeal to&#10;him to settle down and be good, work out his four years, and go&#10;home. The next time, he was caught in the very act of running away.&#10;His case was brought before Mr. Haveby, the island manager of the&#10;Moongleam Soap Company, who adjudged him an incorrigible. The&#10;Company had plantations on the Santa Cruz Islands, hundreds of&#10;miles across the sea, and there it sent its Solomon Islands&#39;&#10;incorrigibles. And there Mauki was sent, though he never arrived.&#10;The schooner stopped at Santa Anna, and in the night Mauki swam&#10;ashore, where he stole two rifles and a case of tobacco from the&#10;trader and got away in a canoe to Cristoval. Malaita was now to the&#10;north, fifty or sixty miles away. But when he attempted the&#10;passage, he was caught by a light gale and driven back to Santa&#10;Anna, where the trader clapped him in irons and held him against&#10;the return of the schooner from Santa Cruz. The two rifles the&#10;trader recovered, but the case of tobacco was charged up to Mauki&#10;at the rate of another year. The sum of years he now owed the&#10;Company was six.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;On the way back to New Georgia, the schooner dropped anchor in&#10;Marau Sound, which lies at the southeastern extremity of&#10;Guadalcanar. Mauki swam ashore with handcuffs on his wrists and got&#10;away to the bush. The schooner went on, but the Moongleam trader&#10;ashore offered a thousand sticks, and to him Mauki was brought by&#10;the bushmen with a year and eight months tacked on to his account.&#10;Again, and before the schooner called in, he got away, this time in&#10;a whale boat accompanied by a case of the trader&#39;s tobacco. But a&#10;northwest gale wrecked him upon Ugi, where the Christian natives&#10;stole his tobacco and turned him over to the Moongleam trader who&#10;resided there. The tobacco the natives stole meant another year for&#10;him, and the tale was now eight years and a half.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;We&#39;ll send him to Lord Howe,&#34; said Mr. Haveby. &#34;Bunster is&#10;there, and we&#39;ll let them settle it between them. It will be a&#10;case, I imagine, of Mauki getting Bunster, or Bunster getting&#10;Mauki, and good riddance in either event.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;If one leaves Meringe Lagoon, on Ysabel, and steers a course due&#10;north, magnetic, at the end of one hundred and fifty miles he will&#10;lift the pounded coral beaches of Lord Howe above the sea. Lord&#10;Howe is a ring of land some one hundred and fifty miles in&#10;circumference, several hundred yards wide at its widest, and&#10;towering in places to a height of ten feet above sea level. Inside&#10;this ring of sand is a mighty lagoon studded with coral patches.&#10;Lord Howe belongs to the Solomons neither geographically nor&#10;ethnologically. It is an atoll, while the Solomons are high&#10;islands; and its people and language are Polynesian, while the&#10;inhabitants of the Solomons are Melanesian.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Lord Howe has been populated by the westward Polynesian drift&#10;which continues to this day, big outrigger canoes being washed upon&#10;its beaches by the southeast trade. That there has been a slight&#10;Melanesian drift in the period of the northwest monsoon, is also&#10;evident.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Nobody ever comes to Lord Howe, or Ontong-Java as it is&#10;sometimes called. Thomas Cook &#38;amp; Son do not sell tickets to it,&#10;and tourists do not dream of its existence. Not even a white&#10;missionary has landed on its shore. Its five thousand natives are&#10;as peaceable as they are primitive. Yet they were not always&#10;peaceable. The Sailing Directions speak of them as hostile and&#10;treacherous. But the men who compile the Sailing Directions have&#10;never heard of the change that was worked in the hearts of the&#10;inhabitants, who, not many years ago, cut off a big bark and killed&#10;all hands with the exception of the second mate. The survivor&#10;carried the news to his brothers. The captains of three trading&#10;schooners returned with him to Lord Howe. They sailed their vessels&#10;right into the lagoon and proceeded to preach the white man&#39;s&#10;gospel that only white men shall kill white men and that the lesser&#10;breeds must keep hands off. The schooners sailed up and down the&#10;lagoon, harrying and destroying. There was no escape from the&#10;narrow sand-circle, no bush to which to flee. The men were shot&#10;down at sight, and there was no avoiding being sighted. The&#10;villages were burned, the canoes smashed, the chickens and pigs&#10;killed, and the precious cocoanut trees chopped down. For a month&#10;this continued, when the schooner sailed away; but the fear of the&#10;white man had been seared into the souls of the islanders and never&#10;again were they rash enough to harm one.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Max Bunster was the one white man on Lord Howe, trading in the&#10;pay of the ubiquitous Moongleam Soap Company. And the Company&#10;billeted him on Lord Howe, because, next to getting rid of him, it&#10;was the most out-of-the-way place to be found. That the Company did&#10;not get rid of him was due to the difficulty of finding another man&#10;to take his place. He was a strapping big German, with something&#10;wrong in his brain. Semi-madness would be a charitable statement of&#10;his condition. He was a bully and a coward, and a thrice-bigger&#10;savage than any savage on the island.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Being a coward, his brutality was of the cowardly order. When he&#10;first went into the Company&#39;s employ, he was stationed on Savo.&#10;When a consumptive colonial was sent to take his place, he beat him&#10;up with his fists and sent him off a wreck in the schooner that&#10;brought him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Haveby next selected a young Yorkshire giant to relieve&#10;Bunster. The Yorkshire man had a reputation as a bruiser and&#10;preferred fighting to eating. But Bunster wouldn&#39;t fight. He was a&#10;regular little lamb&#8212;for ten days, at the end of which time the&#10;Yorkshire man was prostrated by a combined attack of dysentery and&#10;fever. Then Bunster went for him, among other things getting him&#10;down and jumping on him a score or so of times. Afraid of what&#10;would happen when his victim recovered. Bunster fled away in a&#10;cutter to Guvutu, where he signalized himself by beating up a young&#10;Englishman already crippled by a Boer bullet through both hips.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then it was that Mr. Haveby sent Bunster to Lord Howe, the&#10;falling-off place. He celebrated his landing by mopping up half a&#10;case of gin and by thrashing the elderly and wheezy mate of the&#10;schooner which had brought him. When the schooner departed, he&#10;called the kanakas down to the beach and challenged them to throw&#10;him in a wrestling bout, promising a case of tobacco to the one who&#10;succeeded. Three kanakas he threw, but was promptly thrown by a&#10;fourth, who, instead of receiving the tobacco, got a bullet through&#10;his lungs.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And so began Bunster&#39;s reign on Lord Howe. Three thousand people&#10;lived in the principal village; but it was deserted, even in broad&#10;day, when he passed through. Men, women, and children fled before&#10;him. Even the dogs and pigs got out of the way, while the king was&#10;not above hiding under a mat. The two prime ministers lived in&#10;terror of Bunster, who never discussed any moot subject, but struck&#10;out with his fists instead.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And to Lord Howe came Mauki, to toil for Bunster for eight long&#10;years and a half. There was no escaping from Lord Howe. For better&#10;or worse, Bunster and he were tied together. Bunster weighed two&#10;hundred pounds. Mauki weighed one hundred and ten. Bunster was a&#10;degenerate brute. But Mauki was a primitive savage. While both had&#10;wills and ways of their own.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mauki had no idea of the sort of master he was to work for. He&#10;had had no warnings, and he had concluded as a matter of course&#10;that Bunster would be like other white men, a drinker of much&#10;whiskey, a ruler and a lawgiver who always kept his word and who&#10;never struck a boy undeserved. Bunster had the advantage. He knew&#10;all about Mauki, and gloated over the coming into possession of&#10;him. The last cook was suffering from a broken arm and a dislocated&#10;shoulder, so Bunster made Mauki cook and general house-boy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And Mauki soon learned that there were white men and white men.&#10;On the very day the schooner departed he was ordered to buy a&#10;chicken from Samisee, the native Tongan missionary. But Samisee had&#10;sailed across the lagoon and would not be back for three days.&#10;Mauki returned with the information. He climbed the steep stairway&#10;(the house stood on piles twelve feet above the sand), and entered&#10;the living room to report. The trader demanded the chicken. Mauki&#10;opened his mouth to explain the missionary&#39;s absence. But Bunster&#10;did not care for explanations. He struck out with his fist. The&#10;blow caught Mauki on the mouth and lifted him into the air. Clear&#10;through the doorway he flew, across the narrow veranda, breaking&#10;the top railing, and down to the ground.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;His lips were a contused, shapeless mass, and his mouth was full&#10;of blood and broken teeth.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That&#39;ll teach you that back talk don&#39;t go with me,&#34; the trader&#10;shouted, purple with rage, peering down at him over the broken&#10;railing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mauki had never met a white man like this, and he resolved to&#10;walk small and never offend. He saw the boat boys knocked about,&#10;and one of them put in irons for three days with nothing to eat for&#10;the crime of breaking a rowlock while pulling. Then, too, he heard&#10;the gossip of the village and learned why Bunster had taken a third&#10;wife&#8212;by force, as was well known. The first and second wives lay in&#10;the graveyard, under the white coral sand, with slabs of coral rock&#10;at head and feet. They had died, it was said, from beatings he had&#10;given them. The third wife was certainly ill-used, as Mauki could&#10;see for himself.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But there was no way by which to avoid offending the white man&#10;who seemed offended with life. When Mauki kept silent, he was&#10;struck and called a sullen brute. When he spoke, he was struck for&#10;giving back talk. When he was grave, Bunster accused him of&#10;plotting and gave him a thrashing in advance; and when he strove to&#10;be cheerful and to smile, he was charged with sneering at his lord&#10;and master and given a taste of stick. Bunster was a devil.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The village would have done for him, had it not remembered the&#10;lesson of the three schooners. It might have done for him anyway,&#10;if there had been a bush to which to flee. As it was, the murder of&#10;the white men, of any white man, would bring a man-of-war that&#10;would kill the offenders and chop down the precious cocoanut trees.&#10;Then there were the boat boys, with minds fully made up to drown&#10;him by accident at the first opportunity to capsize the cutter.&#10;Only Bunster saw to it that the boat did not capsize.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mauki was of a different breed, and escape being impossible&#10;while Bunster lived, he was resolved to get the white man. The&#10;trouble was that he could never find a chance. Bunster was always&#10;on guard. Day and night his revolvers were ready to hand. He&#10;permitted nobody to pass behind his back, as Mauki learned after&#10;having been knocked down several times. Bunster knew that he had&#10;more to fear from the good-natured, even sweet-faced, Malaita boy&#10;than from the entire population of Lord Howe; and it gave added&#10;zest to the programme of torment he was carrying out. And Mauki&#10;walked small, accepted his punishments, and waited.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;All other white men had respected his tambos, but not so&#10;Bunster.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mauki&#39;s weekly allowance of tobacco was two sticks. Bunster&#10;passed them to his woman and ordered Mauki to receive them from her&#10;hand. But this could not be, and Mauki went without his tobacco. In&#10;the same way he was made to miss many a meal, and to go hungry many&#10;a day. He was ordered to make chowder out of the big clams that&#10;grew in the lagoon. This he could not do, for clams were tambo. Six&#10;times in succession he refused to touch the clams, and six times he&#10;was knocked senseless. Bunster knew that the boy would die first,&#10;but called his refusal mutiny, and would have killed him had there&#10;been another cook to take his place.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;One of the trader&#39;s favorite tricks was to catch Mauki&#39;s kinky&#10;locks and bat his head against the wall. Another trick was to catch&#10;Mauki unawares and thrust the live end of a cigar against his&#10;flesh. This Bunster called vaccination, and Mauki was vaccinated a&#10;number of times a week. Once, in a rage, Bunster ripped the cup&#10;handle from Mauki&#39;s nose, tearing the hole clear out of the&#10;cartilage.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh, what a mug!&#34; was his comment, when he surveyed the damage&#10;he had wrought.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The skin of a shark is like sandpaper, but the skin of a ray&#10;fish is like a rasp. In the South Seas the natives use it as a wood&#10;file in smoothing down canoes and paddles. Bunster had a mitten&#10;made of ray fish skin. The first time he tried it on Mauki, with&#10;one sweep of the hand it fetched the skin off his back from neck to&#10;armpit. Bunster was delighted. He gave his wife a taste of the&#10;mitten, and tried it out thoroughly on the boat boys. The prime&#10;ministers came in for a stroke each, and they had to grin and take&#10;it for a joke.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Laugh, damn you, laugh!&#34; was the cue he gave.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mauki came in for the largest share of the mitten. Never a day&#10;passed without a caress from it. There were times when the loss of&#10;so much cuticle kept him awake at night, and often the half-healed&#10;surface was raked raw afresh by the facetious Mr. Bunster. Mauki&#10;continued his patient wait, secure in the knowledge that sooner or&#10;later his time would come. And he knew just what he was going to&#10;do, down to the smallest detail, when the time did come.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;One morning Bunster got up in a mood for knocking seven bells&#10;out of the universe. He began on Mauki, and wound up on Mauki, in&#10;the interval knocking down his wife and hammering all the boat&#10;boys. At breakfast he called the coffee slops and threw the&#10;scalding contents of the cup into Mauki&#39;s face. By ten o&#39;clock&#10;Bunster was shivering with ague, and half an hour later he was&#10;burning with fever. It was no ordinary attack. It quickly became&#10;pernicious, and developed into black-water fever. The days passed,&#10;and he grew weaker and weaker, never leaving his bed. Mauki waited&#10;and watched, the while his skin grew intact once more. He ordered&#10;the boys to beach the cutter, scrub her bottom, and give her a&#10;general overhauling. They thought the order emanated from Bunster,&#10;and they obeyed. But Bunster at the time was lying unconscious and&#10;giving no orders. This was Mauki&#39;s chance, but still he waited.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When the worst was past, and Bunster lay convalescent and&#10;conscious, but weak as a baby, Mauki packed his few trinkets,&#10;including the china cup handle, into his trade box. Then he went&#10;over to the village and interviewed the king and his two prime&#10;ministers.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;This fella Bunster, him good fella you like too much?&#34; he&#10;asked.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;They explained in one voice that they liked the trader not at&#10;all. The ministers poured forth a recital of all the indignities&#10;and wrongs that had been heaped upon them. The king broke down and&#10;wept. Mauki interrupted rudely.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You savve me&#8212;me big fella marster my country. You no like m&#10;this fella white marster. Me no like m. Plenty good you put hundred&#10;cocoanut, two hundred cocoanut, three hundred cocoanut along&#10;cutter. Him finish, you go sleep m good fella. Altogether kanaka&#10;sleep m good fella. Bime by big fella noise along house, you no&#10;savve hear m that fella noise. You altogether sleep strong fella&#10;too much.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In like manner Mauki interviewed the boat boys. Then he ordered&#10;Bunster&#39;s wife to return to her family house. Had she refused, he&#10;would have been in a quandary, for his tambo would not have&#10;permitted him to lay hands on her.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The house deserted, he entered the sleeping room, where the&#10;trader lay in a doze. Mauki first removed the revolvers, then&#10;placed the ray fish mitten on his hand. Bunster&#39;s first warning was&#10;a stroke of the mitten that removed the skin the full length of his&#10;nose.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Good fella, eh?&#34; Mauki grinned, between two strokes, one of&#10;which swept the forehead bare and the other of which cleaned off&#10;one side of his face. &#34;Laugh, damn you, laugh.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mauki did his work throughly, and the kanakas, hiding in their&#10;houses, heard the &#34;big fella noise&#34; that Bunster made and continued&#10;to make for an hour or more.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When Mauki was done, he carried the boat compass and all the&#10;rifles and ammunition down to the cutter, which he proceeded to&#10;ballast with cases of tobacco. It was while engaged in this that a&#10;hideous, skinless thing came out of the house and ran screaming&#10;down the beach till it fell in the sand and mowed and gibbered&#10;under the scorching sun. Mauki looked toward it and hesitated. Then&#10;he went over and removed the head, which he wrapped in a mat and&#10;stowed in the stern locker of the cutter.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So soundly did the kanakas sleep through that long hot day that&#10;they did not see the cutter run out through the passage and head&#10;south, close-hauled on the southeast trade. Nor was the cutter ever&#10;sighted on that long tack to the shores of Ysabel, and during the&#10;tedious head-beat from there to Malaita. He landed at Port Adams&#10;with a wealth of rifles and tobacco such as no one man had ever&#10;possessed before. But he did not stop there. He had taken a white&#10;man&#39;s head, and only the bush could shelter him. So back he went to&#10;the bush villages, where he shot old Fanfoa and half a dozen of the&#10;chief men, and made himself the chief over all the villages. When&#10;his father died, Mauki&#39;s brother ruled in Port Adams, and joined&#10;together, salt-water men and bushmen, the resulting combination was&#10;the strongest of the ten score fighting tribes of Malaita.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;More than his fear of the British government was Mauki&#39;s fear of&#10;the all-powerful Moongleam Soap Company; and one day a message came&#10;up to him in the bush, reminding him that he owed the Company eight&#10;and one-half years of labor. He sent back a favorable answer, and&#10;then appeared the inevitable white man, the captain of the&#10;schooner, the only white man during Mauki&#39;s reign, who ventured the&#10;bush and came out alive. This man not only came out, but he brought&#10;with him seven hundred and fifty dollars in gold sovereigns&#8212;the&#10;money price of eight years and a half of labor plus the cost price&#10;of certain rifles and cases of tobacco.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mauki no longer weighs one hundred and ten pounds. His stomach&#10;is three times its former girth, and he has four wives. He has many&#10;other things&#8212;rifles and revolvers, the handle of a china cup, and&#10;an excellent collection of bushmen&#39;s heads. But more precious than&#10;the entire collection is another head, perfectly dried and cured,&#10;with sandy hair and a yellowish beard, which is kept wrapped in the&#10;finest of fibre lava-lavas. When Mauki goes to war with villages&#10;beyond his realm, he invariably gets out this head, and alone in&#10;his grass palace, contemplates it long and solemnly. At such times&#10;the hush of death falls on the village, and not even a pickaninny&#10;dares make a noise. The head is esteemed the most powerful&#10;devil-devil on Malaita, and to the possession of it is ascribed all&#10;of Mauki&#39;s greatness.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 9, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/1176', :deleted => 0)

Yah!&#34;'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;He was a whiskey-guzzling Scotchman, and he downed his whiskey&#10;neat, beginning with his first tot punctually at six in the&#10;morning, and thereafter repeating it at regular intervals&#10;throughout the day till bedtime, which was usually midnight. He&#10;slept but five hours out of the twenty-four, and for the remaining&#10;nineteen hours he was quietly and decently drunk. During the eight&#10;weeks I spent with him on Oolong Atoll, I never saw him draw a&#10;sober breath. In fact, his sleep was so short that he never had&#10;time to sober up. It was the most beautiful and orderly perennial&#10;drunk I have ever observed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;McAllister was his name. He was an old man, and very shaky on&#10;his pins. His hand trembled as with a palsy, especially noticeable&#10;when he poured his whiskey, though I never knew him to spill a&#10;drop. He had been twenty-eight years in Melanesia, ranging from&#10;German New Guinea to the German Solomons, and so thoroughly had he&#10;become identified with that portion of the world, that he&#10;habitually spoke in that bastard lingo called &#34;bech-de-mer.&#34; Thus,&#10;in conversation with me, SUN HE COME UP meant sunrise; KAI-KAI HE&#10;STOP meant that dinner was served; and BELLY BELONG ME WALK ABOUT&#10;meant that he was sick at his stomach. He was a small man, and a&#10;withered one, burned inside and outside by ardent spirits and&#10;ardent sun. He was a cinder, a bit of a clinker of a man, a little&#10;animated clinker, not yet quite cold, that moved stiffly and by&#10;starts and jerks like an automaton. A gust of wind would have blown&#10;him away. He weighed ninety pounds.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But the immense thing about him was the power with which he&#10;ruled. Oolong Atoll was one hundred and forty miles in&#10;circumference. One steered by compass course in its lagoon. It was&#10;populated by five thousand Polynesians, all strapping men and&#10;women, many of them standing six feet in height and weighing a&#10;couple of hundred pounds. Oolong was two hundred and fifty miles&#10;from the nearest land. Twice a year a little schooner called to&#10;collect copra. The one white man on Oolong was McAllister, petty&#10;trader and unintermittent guzzler; and he ruled Oolong and its six&#10;thousand savages with an iron hand. He said come, and they came,&#10;go, and they went. They never questioned his will nor judgment. He&#10;was cantankerous as only an aged Scotchman can be, and interfered&#10;continually in their personal affairs. When Nugu, the king&#39;s&#10;daughter, wanted to marry Haunau from the other end of the atoll,&#10;her father said yes; but McAllister said no, and the marriage never&#10;came off. When the king wanted to buy a certain islet in the lagoon&#10;from the chief priest, McAllister said no. The king was in debt to&#10;the Company to the tune of 180,000 cocoanuts, and until that was&#10;paid he was not to spend a single cocoanut on anything else.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And yet the king and his people did not love McAllister. In&#10;truth, they hated him horribly, and, to my knowledge, the whole&#10;population, with the priests at the head, tried vainly for three&#10;months to pray him to death. The devil-devils they sent after him&#10;were awe-inspiring, but since McAllister did not believe in&#10;devil-devils, they were without power over him. With drunken&#10;Scotchmen all signs fail. They gathered up scraps of food which had&#10;touched his lips, an empty whiskey bottle, a cocoanut from which he&#10;had drunk, and even his spittle, and performed all kinds of&#10;deviltries over them. But McAllister lived on. His health was&#10;superb. He never caught fever; nor coughs nor colds; dysentery&#10;passed him by; and the malignant ulcers and vile skin diseases that&#10;attack blacks and whites alike in that climate never fastened upon&#10;him. He must have been so saturated with alcohol as to defy the&#10;lodgment of germs. I used to imagine them falling to the ground in&#10;showers of microscopic cinders as fast as they entered his&#10;whiskey-sodden aura. No one loved him, not even germs, while he&#10;loved only whiskey, and still he lived.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I was puzzled. I could not understand six thousand natives&#10;putting up with that withered shrimp of a tyrant. It was a miracle&#10;that he had not died suddenly long since. Unlike the cowardly&#10;Melanesians, the people were high-stomached and warlike. In the big&#10;graveyard, at head and feet of the graves, were relics of past&#10;sanguinary history&#8212;blubber-spades, rusty old bayonets and&#10;cutlasses, copper bolts, rudder-irons, harpoons, bomb guns, bricks&#10;that could have come from nowhere but a whaler&#39;s trying-out&#10;furnace, and old brass pieces of the sixteenth century that&#10;verified the traditions of the early Spanish navigators. Ship after&#10;ship had come to grief on Oolong. Not thirty years before, the&#10;whaler BLENNERDALE, running into the lagoon for repair, had been&#10;cut off with all hands. In similar fashion had the crew of the&#10;GASKET, a sandalwood trader, perished. There was a big French bark,&#10;the TOULON, becalmed off the atoll, which the islanders boarded&#10;after a sharp tussle and wrecked in the Lipau Passage, the captain&#10;and a handful of sailors escaping in the longboat. Then there were&#10;the Spanish pieces, which told of the loss of one of the early&#10;explorers. All this, of the vessels named, is a matter of history,&#10;and is to be found in the SOUTH PACIFIC SAILING DIRECTORY. But that&#10;there was other history, unwritten, I was yet to learn. In the&#10;meantime I puzzled why six thousand primitive savages let one&#10;degenerate Scotch despot live.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;One hot afternoon McAllister and I sat on the veranda looking&#10;out over the lagoon, with all its wonder of jeweled colors. At our&#10;backs, across the hundred yards of palm-studded sand, the outer&#10;surf roared on the reef. It was dreadfully warm. We were in four&#10;degree south latitude and the sun was directly overhead, having&#10;crossed the Line a few days before on its journey south. There was&#10;no wind&#8212;not even a catspaw. The season of the southeast trade was&#10;drawing to an early close, and the northwest monsoon had not yet&#10;begun to blow.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;They can&#39;t dance worth a damn,&#34; said McAllister.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I had happened to mention that the Polynesian dances were&#10;superior to the Papuan, and this McAllister had denied, for no&#10;other reason than his cantankerousness. But it was too not to&#10;argue, and I said nothing. Besides, I had never seen the Oolong&#10;people dance.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I&#39;ll prove it to you,&#34; he announced, beckoning to the black New&#10;Hanover boy, a labor recruit, who served as cook and general house&#10;servant. &#34;Hey, you, boy, you tell &#39;m one fella king come along&#10;me.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The boy departed, and back came the prime minister, perturbed,&#10;ill at ease, and garrulous with apologetic explanation. In short,&#10;the king slept, and was not to be disturbed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;King he plenty strong fella sleep,&#34; was his final sentence.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;McAllister was in such a rage that the prime minister&#10;incontinently fled, to return with the king himself. They were a&#10;magnificent pair, the king especially, who must have been all of&#10;six feet three inches in height. His features had the eagle-like&#10;quality that is so frequently found in those of the North American&#10;Indian. He had been molded and born to rule. His eyes flashed as he&#10;listened, but right meekly he obeyed McAllister&#39;s command to fetch&#10;a couple of hundred of the best dancers, male and female, in the&#10;village. And dance they did, for two mortal hours, under that&#10;broiling sun. They did not love him for it, and little he cared, in&#10;the end dismissing them with abuse and sneers.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The abject servility of those magnificent savages was&#10;terrifying. How could it be? What was the secret of his rule? More&#10;and more I puzzled as the days went by, and though I observed&#10;perpetual examples of his undisputed sovereignty, never a clew was&#10;there as to how it was.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;One day I happened to speak of my disappointment in failing to&#10;trade for a beautiful pair of orange cowries. The pair was worth&#10;five pounds in Sydney if it was worth a cent. I had offered two&#10;hundred sticks of tobacco to the owner, who had held out for three&#10;hundred. When I casually mentioned the situation, McAllister&#10;immediately sent for the man, took the shells from him, and turned&#10;them over to me. Fifty sticks were all he permitted me to pay for&#10;them. The man accepted the tobacco and seemed overjoyed at getting&#10;off so easily. As for me, I resolved to keep a bridle on my tongue&#10;in the future. And still I mulled over the secret of McAllister&#39;s&#10;power. I even went to the extent of asking him directly, but all he&#10;did was to cock one eye, look wise, and take another drink.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;One night I was out fishing in the lagoon with Oti, the man who&#10;had been mulcted of the cowries. Privily, I had made up to him an&#10;additional hundred and fifty sticks, and he had come to regard me&#10;with a respect that was almost veneration, which was curious,&#10;seeing that he was an old man, twice my age at least.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What name you fella kanaka all the same pickaninny?&#34; I began on&#10;him. &#34;This fella trader he one fella. You fella kanaka plenty fella&#10;too much. You fella kanaka just like &#39;m dog&#8212;plenty fright along&#10;that fella trader. He no eat you, fella. He no get &#39;m teeth along&#10;him. What name you too much fright?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;S&#39;pose plenty fella kanaka kill m?&#34; he asked.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;He die,&#34; I retorted. &#34;You fella kanaka kill &#39;m plenty fella&#10;white man long time before. What name you fright this fella white&#10;man?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, we kill &#39;m plenty,&#34; was his answer. &#34;My word! Any amount!&#10;Long time before. One time, me young fella too much, one big fella&#10;ship he stop outside. Wind he no blow. Plenty fella kanaka we get&#10;&#39;m canoe, plenty fella canoe, we go catch &#39;m that fella ship. My&#10;word&#8212;we catch &#39;m big fella fight. Two, three white men shoot like&#10;hell. We no fright. We come alongside, we go up side, plenty fella,&#10;maybe I think fifty-ten (five hundred). One fella white Mary&#10;(woman) belong that fella ship. Never before I see &#39;m white Mary.&#10;Bime by plenty white man finish. One fella skipper he no die. Five&#10;fella, six fella white man no die. Skipper he sing out. Some fella&#10;white man he fight. Some fella white man he lower away boat. After&#10;that, all together over the side they go. Skipper he sling white&#10;Mary down. After that they washee (row) strong fella plenty too&#10;much. Father belong me, that time he strong fella. He throw &#39;m one&#10;fella spear. That fella spear he go in one side that white Mary. He&#10;no stop. My word, he go out other side that fella Mary. She finish.&#10;Me no fright. Plenty kanaka too much no fright.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Old Oti&#39;s pride had been touched, for he suddenly stripped down&#10;his lava-lava and showed me the unmistakable scar of a bullet.&#10;Before I could speak, his line ran out suddenly. He checked it and&#10;attempted to haul in, but found that the fish had run around a&#10;coral branch. Casting a look of reproach at me for having beguiled&#10;him from his watchfulness, he went over the side, feet first,&#10;turning over after he got under and following his line down to&#10;bottom. The water was ten fathoms. I leaned over and watched the&#10;play of his feet, growing dim and dimmer, as they stirred the wan&#10;phosphorescence into ghostly fires. Ten fathoms&#8212;sixty feet&#8212;it was&#10;nothing to him, an old man, compared with the value of a hook and&#10;line. After what seemed five minutes, though it could not have been&#10;more than a minute, I saw him flaming whitely upward. He broke&#10;surface and dropped a ten pound rock cod into the canoe, the line&#10;and hook intact, the latter still fast in the fish&#39;s mouth.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It may be,&#34; I said remorselessly. &#34;You no fright long ago. You&#10;plenty fright now along that fella trader.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, plenty fright,&#34; he confessed, with an air of dismissing&#10;the subject. For half an hour we pulled up our lines and flung them&#10;out in silence. Then small fish-sharks began to bite, and after&#10;losing a hook apiece, we hauled in and waited for the sharks to go&#10;their way.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I speak you true,&#34; Oti broke into speech, &#34;then you savve we&#10;fright now.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I lighted up my pipe and waited, and the story that Oti told me&#10;in atrocious bech-de-mer I here turn into proper English.&#10;Otherwise, in spirit and order of narrative, the tale is as it fell&#10;from Oti&#39;s lips.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It was after that that we were very proud. We had fought many&#10;times with the strange white men who live upon the sea, and always&#10;we had beaten them. A few of us were killed, but what was that&#10;compared with the stores of wealth of a thousand thousand kinds&#10;that we found on the ships? And then one day, maybe twenty years&#10;ago, or twenty-five, there came a schooner right through the&#10;passage and into the lagoon. It was a large schooner with three&#10;masts. She had five white men and maybe forty boat&#39;s crew, black&#10;fellows from New Guinea and New Britain; and she had come to fish&#10;beche-de-mer. She lay at anchor across the lagoon from here, at&#10;Pauloo, and her boats scattered out everywhere, making camps on the&#10;beaches where they cured the beche-de-mer. This made them weak by&#10;dividing them, for those who fished here and those on the schooner&#10;at Pauloo were fifty miles apart, and there were others farther&#10;away still.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Our king and headmen held council, and I was one in the canoe&#10;that paddled all afternoon and all night across the lagoon,&#10;bringing word to the people of Pauloo that in the morning we would&#10;attack the fishing camps at the one time and that it was for them&#10;to take the schooner. We who brought the word were tired with the&#10;paddling, but we took part in the attack. On the schooner were two&#10;white men, the skipper and the second mate, with half a dozen black&#10;boys. The skipper with three boys we caught on shore and killed,&#10;but first eight of us the skipper killed with his two revolvers. We&#10;fought close together, you see, at hand grapples.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The noise of our fighting told the mate what was happening, and&#10;he put food and water and a sail in the small dingy, which was so&#10;small that it was no more than twelve feet long. We came down upon&#10;the schooner, a thousand men, covering the lagoon with our canoes.&#10;Also, we were blowing conch shells, singing war songs, and striking&#10;the sides of the canoes with our paddles. What chance had one white&#10;man and three black boys against us? No chance at all, and the mate&#10;knew it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;White men are hell. I have watched them much, and I am an old&#10;man now, and I understand at last why the white men have taken to&#10;themselves all the islands in the sea. It is because they are hell.&#10;Here are you in the canoe with me. You are hardly more than a boy.&#10;You are not wise, for each day I tell you many things you do not&#10;know. When I was a little pickaninny, I knew more about fish and&#10;the ways of fish than you know now. I am an old man, but I swim&#10;down to the bottom of the lagoon, and you cannot follow me. What&#10;are you good for, anyway? I do not know, except to fight. I have&#10;never seen you fight, yet I know that you are like your brothers&#10;and that you will fight like hell. Also, you are a fool, like your&#10;brothers. You do not know when you are beaten. You will fight until&#10;you die, and then it will be too late to know that you are&#10;beaten.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Now behold what this mate did. As we came down upon him,&#10;covering the sea and blowing our conches, he put off from the&#10;schooner in the small boat, along with the three black boys, and&#10;rowed for the passage. There again he was a fool, for no wise man&#10;would put out to sea in so small a boat. The sides of it were not&#10;four inches above the water. Twenty canoes went after him, filled&#10;with two hundred young men. We paddled five fathoms while his black&#10;boys were rowing one fathom. He had no chance, but he was a fool.&#10;He stood up in the boat with a rifle, and he shot many times. He&#10;was not a good shot, but as we drew close many of us were wounded&#10;and killed. But still he had no chance.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I remember that all the time he was smoking a cigar. When we&#10;were forty feet away and coming fast, he dropped the rifle, lighted&#10;a stick of dynamite with the cigar, and threw it at us. He lighted&#10;another and another, and threw them at us very rapidly, many of&#10;them. I know now that he must have split the ends of the fuses and&#10;stuck in match heads, because they lighted so quickly. Also, the&#10;fuses were very short. Sometimes the dynamite sticks went off in&#10;the air, but most of them went off in the canoes. And each time&#10;they went off in a canoe, that canoe was finished. Of the twenty&#10;canoes, the half were smashed to pieces. The canoe I was in was so&#10;smashed, and likewise the two men who sat next to me. The dynamite&#10;fell between them. The other canoes turned and ran away. Then that&#10;mate yelled, Yah! Yah! Yah!&#39; at us. Also he went at us again with&#10;his rifle, so that many were killed through the back as they fled&#10;away. And all the time the black boys in the boat went on rowing.&#10;You see, I told you true, that mate was hell.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Nor was that all. Before he left the schooner, he set her on&#10;fire, and fixed up all the powder and dynamite so that it would go&#10;off at one time. There were hundreds of us on board, trying to put&#10;out the fire, heaving up water from overside, when the schooner&#10;blew up. So that all we had fought for was lost to us, besides many&#10;more of us being killed. Sometimes, even now, in my old age, I have&#10;bad dreams in which I hear that mate yell, Yah! Yah! Yah!&#39; In a&#10;voice of thunder he yells, Yah! Yah! Yah!&#39; But all those in the&#10;fishing camps were killed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The mate went out of the passage in his little boat, and that&#10;was the end of him we made sure, for how could so small a boat,&#10;with four men in it, live on the ocean? A month went by, and then,&#10;one morning, between two rain squalls, a schooner sailed in through&#10;our passage and dropped anchor before the village. The king and the&#10;headmen made big talk, and it was agreed that we would take the&#10;schooner in two or three days. In the meantime, as it was our&#10;custom always to appear friendly, we went off to her in canoes,&#10;bringing strings of cocoanuts, fowls, and pigs, to trade. But when&#10;we were alongside, many canoes of us, the men on board began to&#10;shoot us with rifles, and as we paddled away I saw the mate who had&#10;gone to sea in the little boat spring upon the rail and dance and&#10;yell, Yah! Yah! Yah!&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That afternoon they landed from the schooner in three small&#10;boats filled with white men. They went right through the village,&#10;shooting every man they saw. Also they shot the fowls and pigs. We&#10;who were not killed got away in canoes and paddled out into the&#10;lagoon. Looking back, we could see all the houses on fire. Late in&#10;the afternoon we saw many canoes coming from Nihi, which is the&#10;village near the Nihi Passage in the northeast. They were all that&#10;were left, and like us their village had been burned by a second&#10;schooner that had come through Nihi Passage.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;We stood on in the darkness to the westward for Pauloo, but in&#10;the middle of the night we heard women wailing and then we ran into&#10;a big fleet of canoes. They were all that were left of Pauloo,&#10;which likewise was in ashes, for a third schooner had come in&#10;through the Pauloo Passage. You see, that mate, with his black&#10;boys, had not been drowned. He had made the Solomon Islands, and&#10;there told his brothers of what we had done in Oolong. And all his&#10;brothers had said they would come and punish us, and there they&#10;were in the three schooners, and our three villages were wiped&#10;out.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And what was there for us to do? In the morning the two&#10;schooners from windward sailed down upon us in the middle of the&#10;lagoon. The trade wind was blowing fresh, and by scores of canoes&#10;they ran us down. And the rifles never ceased talking. We scattered&#10;like flying fish before the bonita, and there were so many of us&#10;that we escaped by thousands, this way and that, to the islands on&#10;the rim of the atoll.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And thereafter the schooners hunted us up and down the lagoon.&#10;In the nighttime we slipped past them. But the next day, or in two&#10;days or three days, the schooners would be coming back, hunting us&#10;toward the other end of the lagoon. And so it went. We no longer&#10;counted nor remembered our dead. True, we were many and they were&#10;few. But what could we do? I was in one of the twenty canoes filled&#10;with men who were not afraid to die. We attacked the smallest&#10;schooner. They shot us down in heaps. They threw dynamite into the&#10;canoes, and when the dynamite gave out, they threw hot water down&#10;upon us. And the rifles never ceased talking. And those whose&#10;canoes were smashed were shot as they swam away. And the mate&#10;danced up and down upon the cabin top and yelled, &#34;Yah! Yah!&#10;Yah!&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Every house on every smallest island was burned. Not a pig nor&#10;a fowl was left alive. Our wells were defiled with the bodies of&#10;the slain, or else heaped high with coral rock. We were twenty-five&#10;thousand on Oolong before the three schooners came. Today we are&#10;five thousand. After the schooners left, we were but three&#10;thousand, as you shall see.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;At last the three schooners grew tired of chasing us back and&#10;forth. So they went, the three of them, to Nihi, in the northeast.&#10;And then they drove us steadily to the west. Their nine boats were&#10;in the water as well. They beat up every island as they moved&#10;along. They drove us, drove us, drove us day by day. And every&#10;night the three schooners and the nine boats made a chain of&#10;watchfulness that stretched across the lagoon from rim to rim, so&#10;that we could not escape back.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;They could not drive us forever that way, for the lagoon was&#10;only so large, and at last all of us that yet lived were driven&#10;upon the last sand bank to the west. Beyond lay the open sea. There&#10;were ten thousand of us, and we covered the sand bank from the&#10;lagoon edge to the pounding surf on the other side. No one could&#10;lie down. There was no room. We stood hip to hip and shoulder to&#10;shoulder. Two days they kept us there, and the mate would climb up&#10;in the rigging to mock us and yell, Yah! Yah! Yah!&#39; till we were&#10;well sorry that we had ever harmed him or his schooner a month&#10;before. We had no food, and we stood on our feet two days and&#10;nights. The little babies died, and the old and weak died, and the&#10;wounded died. And worst of all, we had no water to quench our&#10;thirst, and for two days the sun beat down on us, and there was no&#10;shade. Many men and women waded out into the ocean and were&#10;drowned, the surf casting their bodies back on the beach. And there&#10;came a pest of flies. Some men swam to the sides of the schooners,&#10;but they were shot to the last one. And we that lived were very&#10;sorry that in our pride we tried to take the schooner with the&#10;three masts that came to fish for beche-de-mer.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;On the morning of the third day came the skippers of the three&#10;schooners and that mate in a small boat. They carried rifles, all&#10;of them, and revolvers, and they made talk. It was only that they&#10;were weary of killing us that they had stopped, they told us. And&#10;we told them that we were sorry, that never again would we harm a&#10;white man, and in token of our submission we poured sand upon our&#10;heads. And all the women and children set up a great wailing for&#10;water, so that for some time no man could make himself heard. Then&#10;we were told our punishment. We must fill the three schooners with&#10;copra and beche-de-mer. And we agreed, for we wanted water, and our&#10;hearts were broken, and we knew that we were children at fighting&#10;when we fought with white men who fight like hell. And when all the&#10;talk was finished, the mate stood up and mocked us, and yelled,&#10;Yah! Yah! Yah!&#39; After that we paddled away in our canoes and sought&#10;water.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And for weeks we toiled at catching beche-de-mer and curing it,&#10;in gathering the cocoanuts and turning them into copra. By day and&#10;night the smoke rose in clouds from all the beaches of all the&#10;islands of Oolong as we paid the penalty of our wrongdoing. For in&#10;those days of death it was burned clearly on all our brains that it&#10;was very wrong to harm a white man.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;By and by, the schooners full of copra and beche-de-mer and our&#10;trees empty of cocoanuts, the three skippers and that mate called&#10;us all together for a big talk. And they said they were very glad&#10;that we had learned our lesson, and we said for the ten-thousandth&#10;time that we were sorry and that we would not do it again. Also, we&#10;poured sand upon our heads. Then the skippers said that it was all&#10;very well, but just to show us that they did not forget us, they&#10;would send a devil-devil that we would never forget and that we&#10;would always remember any time we might feel like harming a white&#10;man. After that the mate mocked us one more time and yelled, Yah!&#10;Yah! Yah!&#39; Then six of our men, whom we thought long dead, were put&#10;ashore from one of the schooners, and the schooners hoisted their&#10;sails and ran out through the passage for the Solomons.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The six men who were put ashore were the first to catch the&#10;devil-devil the skippers sent back after us.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;A great sickness came,&#34; I interrupted, for I recognized the&#10;trick. The schooner had had measles on board, and the six prisoners&#10;had been deliberately exposed to it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, a great sickness,&#34; Oti went on. &#34;It was a powerful&#10;devil-devil. The oldest man had never heard of the like. Those of&#10;our priests that yet lived we killed because they could not&#10;overcome the devil-devil. The sickness spread. I have said that&#10;there were ten thousand of us that stood hip to hip and shoulder to&#10;shoulder on the sandbank. When the sickness left us, there were&#10;three thousand yet alive. Also, having made all our cocoanuts into&#10;copra, there was a famine.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That fella trader,&#34; Oti concluded, &#34;he like &#39;m that much dirt.&#10;He like &#39;m clam he die KAI-KAI (meat) he stop, stink &#39;m any amount.&#10;He like &#39;m one fella dog, one sick fella dog plenty fleas stop&#10;along him. We no fright along that fella trader. We fright because&#10;he white man. We savve plenty too much no good kill white man. That&#10;one fella sick dog trader he plenty brother stop along him, white&#10;men like &#39;m you fight like hell. We no fright that damn trader.&#10;Some time he made kanaka plenty cross along him and kanaka want &#39;m&#10;kill m, kanaka he think devil-devil and kanaka he hear that fella&#10;mate sing out, Yah! Yah! Yah!&#39; and kanaka no kill m.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Oti baited his hook with a piece of squid, which he tore with&#10;his teeth from the live and squirming monster, and hook and bait&#10;sank in white flames to the bottom.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Shark walk about he finish,&#34; he said. &#34;I think we catch &#39;m&#10;plenty fella fish.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;His line jerked savagely. He pulled it in rapidly, hand under&#10;hand, and landed a big gasping rock cod in the bottom of the&#10;canoe.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Sun he come up, I make &#39;m that dam fella trader one present big&#10;fella fish,&#34; said Oti.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 9, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/1176', :deleted => 0)

Without&#10;doubt I had seen him with the rest of the kanaka crew on board, but&#10;I had not consciously been aware of his existence, for the Petite&#10;Jeanne was rather overcrowded. In addition to her eight or ten&#10;kanaka seamen, her white captain, mate, and supercargo, and her six&#10;cabin passengers, she sailed from Rangiroa with something like&#10;eighty-five deck passengers&#8212; Paumotans and Tahitians, men, women,&#10;and children each with a trade box, to say nothing of sleeping&#10;mats, blankets, and clothes bundles.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The pearling season in the Paumotus was over, and all hands were&#10;returning to Tahiti. The six of us cabin passengers were pearl&#10;buyers. Two were Americans, one was Ah Choon (the whitest Chinese I&#10;have ever known), one was a German, one was a Polish Jew, and I&#10;completed the half dozen.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It had been a prosperous season. Not one of us had cause for&#10;complaint, nor one of the eighty-five deck passengers either. All&#10;had done well, and all were looking forward to a rest-off and a&#10;good time in Papeete.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Of course, the Petite Jeanne was overloaded. She was only&#10;seventy tons, and she had no right to carry a tithe of the mob she&#10;had on board. Beneath her hatches she was crammed and jammed with&#10;pearl shell and copra. Even the trade room was packed full with&#10;shell. It was a miracle that the sailors could work her. There was&#10;no moving about the decks. They simply climbed back and forth along&#10;the rails.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In the night time they walked upon the sleepers, who carpeted&#10;the deck, I&#39;ll swear, two deep. Oh! And there were pigs and&#10;chickens on deck, and sacks of yams, while every conceivable place&#10;was festooned with strings of drinking cocoanuts and bunches of&#10;bananas. On both sides, between the fore and main shrouds, guys had&#10;been stretched, just low enough for the foreboom to swing clear;&#10;and from each of these guys at least fifty bunches of bananas were&#10;suspended.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It promised to be a messy passage, even if we did make it in the&#10;two or three days that would have been required if the southeast&#10;trades had been blowing fresh. But they weren&#39;t blowing fresh.&#10;After the first five hours the trade died away in a dozen or so&#10;gasping fans. The calm continued all that night and the next&#10;day&#8212;one of those glaring, glassy, calms, when the very thought of&#10;opening one&#39;s eyes to look at it is sufficient to cause a&#10;headache.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The second day a man died&#8212;an Easter Islander, one of the best&#10;divers that season in the lagoon. Smallpox&#8212;that is what it was;&#10;though how smallpox could come on board, when there had been no&#10;known cases ashore when we left Rangiroa, is beyond me. There it&#10;was, though&#8212;smallpox, a man dead, and three others down on their&#10;backs.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There was nothing to be done. We could not segregate the sick,&#10;nor could we care for them. We were packed like sardines. There was&#10;nothing to do but rot and die&#8212;that is, there was nothing to do&#10;after the night that followed the first death. On that night, the&#10;mate, the supercargo, the Polish Jew, and four native divers&#10;sneaked away in the large whale boat. They were never heard of&#10;again. In the morning the captain promptly scuttled the remaining&#10;boats, and there we were.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;That day there were two deaths; the following day three; then it&#10;jumped to eight. It was curious to see how we took it. The natives,&#10;for instance, fell into a condition of dumb, stolid fear. The&#10;captain&#8212;Oudouse, his name was, a Frenchman&#8212;became very nervous and&#10;voluble. He actually got the twitches. He was a large fleshy man,&#10;weighing at least two hundred pounds, and he quickly became a&#10;faithful representation of a quivering jelly-mountain of fat.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The German, the two Americans, and myself bought up all the&#10;Scotch whiskey, and proceeded to stay drunk. The theory was&#10;beautiful&#8212;namely, if we kept ourselves soaked in alcohol, every&#10;smallpox germ that came into contact with us would immediately be&#10;scorched to a cinder. And the theory worked, though I must confess&#10;that neither Captain Oudouse nor Ah Choon were attacked by the&#10;disease either. The Frenchman did not drink at all, while Ah Choon&#10;restricted himself to one drink daily.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was a pretty time. The sun, going into northern declination,&#10;was straight overhead. There was no wind, except for frequent&#10;squalls, which blew fiercely for from five minutes to half an hour,&#10;and wound up by deluging us with rain. After each squall, the awful&#10;sun would come out, drawing clouds of steam from the soaked&#10;decks.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The steam was not nice. It was the vapor of death, freighted&#10;with millions and millions of germs. We always took another drink&#10;when we saw it going up from the dead and dying, and usually we&#10;took two or three more drinks, mixing them exceptionally stiff.&#10;Also, we made it a rule to take an additional several each time&#10;they hove the dead over to the sharks that swarmed about us.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;We had a week of it, and then the whiskey gave out. It is just&#10;as well, or I shouldn&#39;t be alive now. It took a sober man to pull&#10;through what followed, as you will agree when I mention the little&#10;fact that only two men did pull through. The other man was the&#10;heathen&#8212;at least, that was what I heard Captain Oudouse call him at&#10;the moment I first became aware of the heathen&#39;s existence. But to&#10;come back.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was at the end of the week, with the whiskey gone, and the&#10;pearl buyers sober, that I happened to glance at the barometer that&#10;hung in the cabin companionway. Its normal register in the Paumotus&#10;was 29.90, and it was quite customary to see it vacillate between&#10;29.85 and 30.00, or even 30.05; but to see it as I saw it, down to&#10;29.62, was sufficient to sober the most drunken pearl buyer that&#10;ever incinerated smallpox microbes in Scotch whiskey.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I called Captain Oudouse&#39;s attention to it, only to be informed&#10;that he had watched it going down for several hours. There was&#10;little to do, but that little he did very well, considering the&#10;circumstances. He took off the light sails, shortened right down to&#10;storm canvas, spread life lines, and waited for the wind. His&#10;mistake lay in what he did after the wind came. He hove to on the&#10;port tack, which was the right thing to do south of the Equator,&#10;if&#8212;and there was the rub&#8212;IF one were NOT in the direct path of the&#10;hurricane.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;We were in the direct path. I could see that by the steady&#10;increase of the wind and the equally steady fall of the barometer.&#10;I wanted him to turn and run with the wind on the port quarter&#10;until the barometer ceased falling, and then to heave to. We argued&#10;till he was reduced to hysteria, but budge he would not. The worst&#10;of it was that I could not get the rest of the pearl buyers to back&#10;me up. Who was I, anyway, to know more about the sea and its ways&#10;than a properly qualified captain? was what was in their minds, I&#10;knew.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Of course, the sea rose with the wind frightfully; and I shall&#10;never forget the first three seas the Petite Jeanne shipped. She&#10;had fallen off, as vessels do at times when hove to, and the first&#10;sea made a clean breach. The life lines were only for the strong&#10;and well, and little good were they even for them when the women&#10;and children, the bananas and cocoanuts, the pigs and trade boxes,&#10;the sick and the dying, were swept along in a solid, screeching,&#10;groaning mass.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The second sea filled the Petite Jeanne&#39;S decks flush with the&#10;rails; and, as her stern sank down and her bow tossed skyward, all&#10;the miserable dunnage of life and luggage poured aft. It was a&#10;human torrent. They came head first, feet first, sidewise, rolling&#10;over and over, twisting, squirming, writhing, and crumpling up. Now&#10;and again one caught a grip on a stanchion or a rope; but the&#10;weight of the bodies behind tore such grips loose.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;One man I noticed fetch up, head on and square on, with the&#10;starboard bitt. His head cracked like an egg. I saw what was&#10;coming, sprang on top of the cabin, and from there into the&#10;mainsail itself. Ah Choon and one of the Americans tried to follow&#10;me, but I was one jump ahead of them. The American was swept away&#10;and over the stern like a piece of chaff. Ah Choon caught a spoke&#10;of the wheel, and swung in behind it. But a strapping Raratonga&#10;vahine (woman)&#8212;she must have weighed two hundred and fifty&#8212;brought&#10;up against him, and got an arm around his neck. He clutched the&#10;kanaka steersman with his other hand; and just at that moment the&#10;schooner flung down to starboard.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The rush of bodies and sea that was coming along the port runway&#10;between the cabin and the rail turned abruptly and poured to&#10;starboard. Away they went&#8212;vahine, Ah Choon, and steersman; and I&#10;swear I saw Ah Choon grin at me with philosophic resignation as he&#10;cleared the rail and went under.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The third sea&#8212;the biggest of the three&#8212;did not do so much&#10;damage. By the time it arrived nearly everybody was in the rigging.&#10;On deck perhaps a dozen gasping, half-drowned, and half-stunned&#10;wretches were rolling about or attempting to crawl into safety.&#10;They went by the board, as did the wreckage of the two remaining&#10;boats. The other pearl buyers and myself, between seas, managed to&#10;get about fifteen women and children into the cabin, and battened&#10;down. Little good it did the poor creatures in the end.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Wind? Out of all my experience I could not have believed it&#10;possible for the wind to blow as it did. There is no describing it.&#10;How can one describe a nightmare? It was the same way with that&#10;wind. It tore the clothes off our bodies. I say TORE THEM OFF, and&#10;I mean it. I am not asking you to believe it. I am merely telling&#10;something that I saw and felt. There are times when I do not&#10;believe it myself. I went through it, and that is enough. One could&#10;not face that wind and live. It was a monstrous thing, and the most&#10;monstrous thing about it was that it increased and continued to&#10;increase.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Imagine countless millions and billions of tons of sand. Imagine&#10;this sand tearing along at ninety, a hundred, a hundred and twenty,&#10;or any other number of miles per hour. Imagine, further, this sand&#10;to be invisible, impalpable, yet to retain all the weight and&#10;density of sand. Do all this, and you may get a vague inkling of&#10;what that wind was like.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Perhaps sand is not the right comparison. Consider it mud,&#10;invisible, impalpable, but heavy as mud. Nay, it goes beyond that.&#10;Consider every molecule of air to be a mudbank in itself. Then try&#10;to imagine the multitudinous impact of mudbanks. No; it is beyond&#10;me. Language may be adequate to express the ordinary conditions of&#10;life, but it cannot possibly express any of the conditions of so&#10;enormous a blast of wind. It would have been better had I stuck by&#10;my original intention of not attempting a description.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I will say this much: The sea, which had risen at first, was&#10;beaten down by that wind. &#39;more: it seemed as if the whole ocean&#10;had been sucked up in the maw of the hurricane, and hurled on&#10;through that portion of space which previously had been occupied by&#10;the air.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Of course, our canvas had gone long before. But Captain Oudouse&#10;had on the Petite Jeanne something I had never before seen on a&#10;South Sea schooner&#8212;a sea anchor. It was a conical canvas bag, the&#10;mouth of which was kept open by a huge loop of iron. The sea anchor&#10;was bridled something like a kite, so that it bit into the water as&#10;a kite bites into the air, but with a difference. The sea anchor&#10;remained just under the surface of the ocean in a perpendicular&#10;position. A long line, in turn, connected it with the schooner. As&#10;a result, the Petite Jeanne rode bow on to the wind and to what sea&#10;there was.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The situation really would have been favorable had we not been&#10;in the path of the storm. True, the wind itself tore our canvas out&#10;of the gaskets, jerked out our topmasts, and made a raffle of our&#10;running gear, but still we would have come through nicely had we&#10;not been square in front of the advancing storm center. That was&#10;what fixed us. I was in a state of stunned, numbed, paralyzed&#10;collapse from enduring the impact of the wind, and I think I was&#10;just about ready to give up and die when the center smote us. The&#10;blow we received was an absolute lull. There was not a breath of&#10;air. The effect on one was sickening.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Remember that for hours we had been at terrific muscular&#10;tension, withstanding the awful pressure of that wind. And then,&#10;suddenly, the pressure was removed. I know that I felt as though I&#10;was about to expand, to fly apart in all directions. It seemed as&#10;if every atom composing my body was repelling every other atom and&#10;was on the verge of rushing off irresistibly into space. But that&#10;lasted only for a moment. Destruction was upon us.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In the absence of the wind and pressure the sea rose. It jumped,&#10;it leaped, it soared straight toward the clouds. Remember, from&#10;every point of the compass that inconceivable wind was blowing in&#10;toward the center of calm. The result was that the seas sprang up&#10;from every point of the compass. There was no wind to check them.&#10;They popped up like corks released from the bottom of a pail of&#10;water. There was no system to them, no stability. They were hollow,&#10;maniacal seas. They were eighty feet high at the least. They were&#10;not seas at all. They resembled no sea a man had ever seen.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;They were splashes, monstrous splashes&#8212;that is all. Splashes&#10;that were eighty feet high. Eighty! They were more than eighty.&#10;They went over our mastheads. They were spouts, explosions. They&#10;were drunken. They fell anywhere, anyhow. They jostled one another;&#10;they collided. They rushed together and collapsed upon one another,&#10;or fell apart like a thousand waterfalls all at once. It was no&#10;ocean any man had ever dreamed of, that hurricane center. It was&#10;confusion thrice confounded. It was anarchy. It was a hell pit of&#10;sea water gone mad.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Petite Jeanne? I don&#39;t know. The heathen told me afterwards&#10;that he did not know. She was literally torn apart, ripped wide&#10;open, beaten into a pulp, smashed into kindling wood, annihilated.&#10;When I came to I was in the water, swimming automatically, though I&#10;was about two-thirds drowned. How I got there I had no&#10;recollection. I remembered seeing the Petite Jeanne fly to pieces&#10;at what must have been the instant that my own consciousness was&#10;buffeted out of me. But there I was, with nothing to do but make&#10;the best of it, and in that best there was little promise. The wind&#10;was blowing again, the sea was much smaller and more regular, and I&#10;knew that I had passed through the center. Fortunately, there were&#10;no sharks about. The hurricane had dissipated the ravenous horde&#10;that had surrounded the death ship and fed off the dead.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was about midday when the Petite Jeanne went to pieces, and&#10;it must have been two hours afterwards when I picked up with one of&#10;her hatch covers. Thick rain was driving at the time; and it was&#10;the merest chance that flung me and the hatch cover together. A&#10;short length of line was trailing from the rope handle; and I knew&#10;that I was good for a day, at least, if the sharks did not return.&#10;Three hours later, possibly a little longer, sticking close to the&#10;cover, and with closed eyes, concentrating my whole soul upon the&#10;task of breathing in enough air to keep me going and at the same&#10;time of avoiding breathing in enough water to drown me, it seemed&#10;to me that I heard voices. The rain had ceased, and wind and sea&#10;were easing marvelously. Not twenty feet away from me, on another&#10;hatch cover were Captain Oudouse and the heathen. They were&#10;fighting over the possession of the cover&#8212;at least, the Frenchman&#10;was. &#34;Paien noir!&#34; I heard him scream, and at the same time I saw&#10;him kick the kanaka.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now, Captain Oudouse had lost all his clothes, except his shoes,&#10;and they were heavy brogans. It was a cruel blow, for it caught the&#10;heathen on the mouth and the point of the chin, half stunning him.&#10;I looked for him to retaliate, but he contented himself with&#10;swimming about forlornly a safe ten feet away. Whenever a fling of&#10;the sea threw him closer, the Frenchman, hanging on with his hands,&#10;kicked out at him with both feet. Also, at the moment of delivering&#10;each kick, he called the kanaka a black heathen.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;For two centimes I&#39;d come over there and drown you, you white&#10;beast!&#34; I yelled.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The only reason I did not go was that I felt too tired. The very&#10;thought of the effort to swim over was nauseating. So I called to&#10;the kanaka to come to me, and proceeded to share the hatch cover&#10;with him. Otoo, he told me his name was (pronounced o-to-o ); also,&#10;he told me that he was a native of Bora Bora, the most westerly of&#10;the Society Group. As I learned afterward, he had got the hatch&#10;cover first, and, after some time, encountering Captain Oudouse,&#10;had offered to share it with him, and had been kicked off for his&#10;pains.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And that was how Otoo and I first came together. He was no&#10;fighter. He was all sweetness and gentleness, a love creature,&#10;though he stood nearly six feet tall and was muscled like a&#10;gladiator. He was no fighter, but he was also no coward. He had the&#10;heart of a lion; and in the years that followed I have seen him run&#10;risks that I would never dream of taking. What I mean is that while&#10;he was no fighter, and while he always avoided precipitating a row,&#10;he never ran away from trouble when it started. And it was &#34;Ware&#10;shoal!&#34; when once Otoo went into action. I shall never forget what&#10;he did to Bill King. It occurred in German Samoa. Bill King was&#10;hailed the champion heavyweight of the American Navy. He was a big&#10;brute of a man, a veritable gorilla, one of those hard-hitting,&#10;rough-housing chaps, and clever with his fists as well. He picked&#10;the quarrel, and he kicked Otoo twice and struck him once before&#10;Otoo felt it to be necessary to fight. I don&#39;t think it lasted four&#10;minutes, at the end of which time Bill King was the unhappy&#10;possessor of four broken ribs, a broken forearm, and a dislocated&#10;shoulder blade. Otoo knew nothing of scientific boxing. He was&#10;merely a manhandler; and Bill King was something like three months&#10;in recovering from the bit of manhandling he received that&#10;afternoon on Apia beach.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But I am running ahead of my yarn. We shared the hatch cover&#10;between us. We took turn and turn about, one lying flat on the&#10;cover and resting, while the other, submerged to the neck, merely&#10;held on with his hands. For two days and nights, spell and spell,&#10;on the cover and in the water, we drifted over the ocean. Towards&#10;the last I was delirious most of the time; and there were times,&#10;too, when I heard Otoo babbling and raving in his native tongue.&#10;Our continuous immersion prevented us from dying of thirst, though&#10;the sea water and the sunshine gave us the prettiest imaginable&#10;combination of salt pickle and sunburn.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In the end, Otoo saved my life; for I came to lying on the beach&#10;twenty feet from the water, sheltered from the sun by a couple of&#10;cocoanut leaves. No one but Otoo could have dragged me there and&#10;stuck up the leaves for shade. He was lying beside me. I went off&#10;again; and the next time I came round, it was cool and starry&#10;night, and Otoo was pressing a drinking cocoanut to my lips.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;We were the sole survivors of the Petite Jeanne. Captain Oudouse&#10;must have succumbed to exhaustion, for several days later his hatch&#10;cover drifted ashore without him. Otoo and I lived with the natives&#10;of the atoll for a week, when we were rescued by the French cruiser&#10;and taken to Tahiti. In the meantime, however, we had performed the&#10;ceremony of exchanging names. In the South Seas such a ceremony&#10;binds two men closer together than blood brothership. The&#10;initiative had been mine; and Otoo was rapturously delighted when I&#10;suggested it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It is well,&#34; he said, in Tahitian. &#34;For we have been mates&#10;together for two days on the lips of Death.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But death stuttered,&#34; I smiled.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It was a brave deed you did, master,&#34; he replied, &#34;and Death&#10;was not vile enough to speak.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why do you &#39;master&#39; me?&#34; I demanded, with a show of hurt&#10;feelings. &#34;We have exchanged names. To you I am Otoo. To me you are&#10;Charley. And between you and me, forever and forever, you shall be&#10;Charley, and I shall be Otoo. It is the way of the custom. And when&#10;we die, if it does happen that we live again somewhere beyond the&#10;stars and the sky, still shall you be Charley to me, and I Otoo to&#10;you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, master,&#34; he answered, his eyes luminous and soft with&#10;joy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;There you go!&#34; I cried indignantly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What does it matter what my lips utter?&#34; he argued. &#34;They are&#10;only my lips. But I shall think Otoo always. Whenever I think of&#10;myself, I shall think of you. Whenever men call me by name, I shall&#10;think of you. And beyond the sky and beyond the stars, always and&#10;forever, you shall be Otoo to me. Is it well, master?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I hid my smile, and answered that it was well.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;We parted at Papeete. I remained ashore to recuperate; and he&#10;went on in a cutter to his own island, Bora Bora. Six weeks later&#10;he was back. I was surprised, for he had told me of his wife, and&#10;said that he was returning to her, and would give over sailing on&#10;far voyages.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Where do you go, master?&#34; he asked, after our first&#10;greetings.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I shrugged my shoulders. It was a hard question.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;All the world,&#34; was my answer&#8212;&#34;all the world, all the sea, and&#10;all the islands that are in the sea.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I will go with you,&#34; he said simply. &#34;My wife is dead.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I never had a brother; but from what I have seen of other men&#39;s&#10;brothers, I doubt if any man ever had a brother that was to him&#10;what Otoo was to me. He was brother and father and mother as well.&#10;And this I know: I lived a straighter and better man because of&#10;Otoo. I cared little for other men, but I had to live straight in&#10;Otoo&#39;s eyes. Because of him I dared not tarnish myself. He made me&#10;his ideal, compounding me, I fear, chiefly out of his own love and&#10;worship and there were times when I stood close to the steep pitch&#10;of hell, and would have taken the plunge had not the thought of&#10;Otoo restrained me. His pride in me entered into me, until it&#10;became one of the major rules in my personal code to do nothing&#10;that would diminish that pride of his.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Naturally, I did not learn right away what his feelings were&#10;toward me. He never criticized, never censured; and slowly the&#10;exalted place I held in his eyes dawned upon me, and slowly I grew&#10;to comprehend the hurt I could inflict upon him by being anything&#10;less than my best.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For seventeen years we were together; for seventeen years he was&#10;at my shoulder, watching while I slept, nursing me through fever&#10;and wounds&#8212;ay, and receiving wounds in fighting for me. He signed&#10;on the same ships with me; and together we ranged the Pacific from&#10;Hawaii to Sydney Head, and from Torres Straits to the Galapagos. We&#10;blackbirded from the New Hebrides and the Line Islands over to the&#10;westward clear through the Louisades, New Britain, New Ireland, and&#10;New Hanover. We were wrecked three times&#8212;in the Gilberts, in the&#10;Santa Cruz group, and in the Fijis. And we traded and salved&#10;wherever a dollar promised in the way of pearl and pearl shell,&#10;copra, beche-de-mer, hawkbill turtle shell, and stranded&#10;wrecks.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It began in Papeete, immediately after his announcement that he&#10;was going with me over all the sea, and the islands in the midst&#10;thereof. There was a club in those days in Papeete, where the&#10;pearlers, traders, captains, and riffraff of South Sea adventurers&#10;forgathered. The play ran high, and the drink ran high; and I am&#10;very much afraid that I kept later hours than were becoming or&#10;proper. No matter what the hour was when I left the club, there was&#10;Otoo waiting to see me safely home.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At first I smiled; next I chided him. Then I told him flatly&#10;that I stood in need of no wet-nursing. After that I did not see&#10;him when I came out of the club. Quite by accident, a week or so&#10;later, I discovered that he still saw me home, lurking across the&#10;street among the shadows of the mango trees. What could I do? I&#10;know what I did do.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Insensibly I began to keep better hours. On wet and stormy&#10;nights, in the thick of the folly and the fun, the thought would&#10;persist in coming to me of Otoo keeping his dreary vigil under the&#10;dripping mangoes. Truly, he made a better man of me. Yet he was not&#10;strait-laced. And he knew nothing of common Christian morality. All&#10;the people on Bora Bora were Christians; but he was a heathen, the&#10;only unbeliever on the island, a gross materialist, who believed&#10;that when he died he was dead. He believed merely in fair play and&#10;square dealing. Petty meanness, in his code, was almost as serious&#10;as wanton homicide; and I do believe that he respected a murderer&#10;more than a man given to small practices.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Concerning me, personally, he objected to my doing anything that&#10;was hurtful to me. Gambling was all right. He was an ardent gambler&#10;himself. But late hours, he explained, were bad for one&#39;s health.&#10;He had seen men who did not take care of themselves die of fever.&#10;He was no teetotaler, and welcomed a stiff nip any time when it was&#10;wet work in the boats. On the other hand, he believed in liquor in&#10;moderation. He had seen many men killed or disgraced by square-face&#10;or Scotch.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Otoo had my welfare always at heart. He thought ahead for me,&#10;weighed my plans, and took a greater interest in them than I did&#10;myself. At first, when I was unaware of this interest of his in my&#10;affairs, he had to divine my intentions, as, for instance, at&#10;Papeete, when I contemplated going partners with a knavish&#10;fellow-countryman on a guano venture. I did not know he was a&#10;knave. Nor did any white man in Papeete. Neither did Otoo know, but&#10;he saw how thick we were getting, and found out for me, and without&#10;my asking him. Native sailors from the ends of the seas knock about&#10;on the beach in Tahiti; and Otoo, suspicious merely, went among&#10;them till he had gathered sufficient data to justify his&#10;suspicions. Oh, it was a nice history, that of Randolph Waters. I&#10;couldn&#39;t believe it when Otoo first narrated it; but when I sheeted&#10;it home to Waters he gave in without a murmur, and got away on the&#10;first steamer to Aukland.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At first, I am free to confess, I couldn&#39;t help resenting Otoo&#39;s&#10;poking his nose into my business. But I knew that he was wholly&#10;unselfish; and soon I had to acknowledge his wisdom and discretion.&#10;He had his eyes open always to my main chance, and he was both&#10;keen-sighted and far-sighted. In time he became my counselor, until&#10;he knew more of my business than I did myself. He really had my&#10;interest at heart more than I did. &#39;mine was the magnificent&#10;carelessness of youth, for I preferred romance to dollars, and&#10;adventure to a comfortable billet with all night in. So it was well&#10;that I had some one to look out for me. I know that if it had not&#10;been for Otoo, I should not be here today.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Of numerous instances, let me give one. I had had some&#10;experience in blackbirding before I went pearling in the Paumotus.&#10;Otoo and I were on the beach in Samoa&#8212;we really were on the beach&#10;and hard aground&#8212;when my chance came to go as recruiter on a&#10;blackbird brig. Otoo signed on before the mast; and for the next&#10;half-dozen years, in as many ships, we knocked about the wildest&#10;portions of Melanesia. Otoo saw to it that he always pulled&#10;stroke-oar in my boat. Our custom in recruiting labor was to land&#10;the recruiter on the beach. The covering boat always lay on its&#10;oars several hundred feet off shore, while the recruiter&#39;s boat,&#10;also lying on its oars, kept afloat on the edge of the beach. When&#10;I landed with my trade goods, leaving my steering sweep apeak, Otoo&#10;left his stroke position and came into the stern sheets, where a&#10;Winchester lay ready to hand under a flap of canvas. The boat&#39;s&#10;crew was also armed, the Sniders concealed under canvas flaps that&#10;ran the length of the gunwales.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;While I was busy arguing and persuading the woolly-headed&#10;cannibals to come and labor on the Queensland plantations Otoo kept&#10;watch. And often and often his low voice warned me of suspicious&#10;actions and impending treachery. Sometimes it was the quick shot&#10;from his rifle, knocking a nigger over, that was the first warning&#10;I received. And in my rush to the boat his hand was always there to&#10;jerk me flying aboard. Once, I remember, on SANTA ANNA, the boat&#10;grounded just as the trouble began. The covering boat was dashing&#10;to our assistance, but the several score of savages would have&#10;wiped us out before it arrived. Otoo took a flying leap ashore, dug&#10;both hands into the trade goods, and scattered tobacco, beads,&#10;tomahawks, knives, and calicoes in all directions.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;This was too much for the woolly-heads. While they scrambled for&#10;the treasures, the boat was shoved clear, and we were aboard and&#10;forty feet away. And I got thirty recruits off that very beach in&#10;the next four hours.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The particular instance I have in mind was on Malaita, the most&#10;savage island in the easterly Solomons. The natives had been&#10;remarkably friendly; and how were we to know that the whole village&#10;had been taking up a collection for over two years with which to&#10;buy a white man&#39;s head? The beggars are all head-hunters, and they&#10;especially esteem a white man&#39;s head. The fellow who captured the&#10;head would receive the whole collection. As I say, they appeared&#10;very friendly; and on this day I was fully a hundred yards down the&#10;beach from the boat. Otoo had cautioned me; and, as usual when I&#10;did not heed him, I came to grief.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The first I knew, a cloud of spears sailed out of the mangrove&#10;swamp at me. At least a dozen were sticking into me. I started to&#10;run, but tripped over one that was fast in my calf, and went down.&#10;The woolly-heads made a run for me, each with a long-handled,&#10;fantail tomahawk with which to hack off my head. They were so eager&#10;for the prize that they got in one another&#39;s way. In the confusion,&#10;I avoided several hacks by throwing myself right and left on the&#10;sand.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then Otoo arrived&#8212;Otoo the manhandler. In some way he had got&#10;hold of a heavy war club, and at close quarters it was a far more&#10;efficient weapon than a rifle. He was right in the thick of them,&#10;so that they could not spear him, while their tomahawks seemed&#10;worse than useless. He was fighting for me, and he was in a true&#10;Berserker rage. The way he handled that club was amazing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Their skulls squashed like overripe oranges. It was not until he&#10;had driven them back, picked me up in his arms, and started to run,&#10;that he received his first wounds. He arrived in the boat with four&#10;spear thrusts, got his Winchester, and with it got a man for every&#10;shot. Then we pulled aboard the schooner, and doctored up.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Seventeen years we were together. He made me. I should today be&#10;a supercargo, a recruiter, or a memory, if it had not been for&#10;him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You spend your money, and you go out and get more,&#34; he said one&#10;day. &#34;It is easy to get money now. But when you get old, your money&#10;will be spent, and you will not be able to go out and get more. I&#10;know, master. I have studied the way of white men. On the beaches&#10;are many old men who were young once, and who could get money just&#10;like you. Now they are old, and they have nothing, and they wait&#10;about for the young men like you to come ashore and buy drinks for&#10;them.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The black boy is a slave on the plantations. He gets twenty&#10;dollars a year. He works hard. The overseer does not work hard.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He rides a horse and watches the black boy work. He gets twelve&#10;hundred dollars a year. I am a sailor on the schooner. I get&#10;fifteen dollars a month. That is because I am a good sailor. I work&#10;hard. The captain has a double awning, and drinks beer out of long&#10;bottles. I have never seen him haul a rope or pull an oar. He gets&#10;one hundred and fifty dollars a month. I am a sailor. He is a&#10;navigator. &#39;master, I think it would be very good for you to know&#10;navigation.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Otoo spurred me on to it. He sailed with me as second mate on my&#10;first schooner, and he was far prouder of my command than I was&#10;myself. Later on it was:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The captain is well paid, master; but the ship is in his&#10;keeping, and he is never free from the burden. It is the owner who&#10;is better paid&#8212;the owner who sits ashore with many servants and&#10;turns his money over.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;True, but a schooner costs five thousand dollars&#8212;an old&#10;schooner at that,&#34; I objected. &#34;I should be an old man before I&#10;saved five thousand dollars.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;There be short ways for white men to make money,&#34; he went on,&#10;pointing ashore at the cocoanut-fringed beach.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;We were in the Solomons at the time, picking up a cargo of ivory&#10;nuts along the east coast of Guadalcanar.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Between this river mouth and the next it is two miles,&#34; he&#10;said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The flat land runs far back. It is worth nothing now. Next&#10;year&#8212;who knows?&#8212;or the year after, men will pay much money for that&#10;land. The anchorage is good. Big steamers can lie close up. You can&#10;buy the land four miles deep from the old chief for ten thousand&#10;sticks of tobacco, ten bottles of square-face, and a Snider, which&#10;will cost you, maybe, one hundred dollars. Then you place the deed&#10;with the commissioner; and the next year, or the year after, you&#10;sell and become the owner of a ship.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I followed his lead, and his words came true, though in three&#10;years, instead of two. Next came the grasslands deal on&#10;Guadalcanar&#8212;twenty thousand acres, on a governmental nine hundred&#10;and ninety-nine years&#39; lease at a nominal sum. I owned the lease&#10;for precisely ninety days, when I sold it to a company for half a&#10;fortune. Always it was Otoo who looked ahead and saw the&#10;opportunity. He was responsible for the salving of the&#10;Doncaster&#8212;bought in at auction for a hundred pounds, and clearing&#10;three thousand after every expense was paid. He led me into the&#10;Savaii plantation and the cocoa venture on Upolu.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;We did not go seafaring so much as in the old days. I was too&#10;well off. I married, and my standard of living rose; but Otoo&#10;remained the same old-time Otoo, moving about the house or trailing&#10;through the office, his wooden pipe in his mouth, a shilling&#10;undershirt on his back, and a four-shilling lava-lava about his&#10;loins. I could not get him to spend money. There was no way of&#10;repaying him except with love, and God knows he got that in full&#10;measure from all of us. The children worshipped him; and if he had&#10;been spoilable, my wife would surely have been his undoing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The children! He really was the one who showed them the way of&#10;their feet in the world practical. He began by teaching them to&#10;walk. He sat up with them when they were sick. One by one, when&#10;they were scarcely toddlers, he took them down to the lagoon, and&#10;made them into amphibians. He taught them more than I ever knew of&#10;the habits of fish and the ways of catching them. In the bush it&#10;was the same thing. At seven, Tom knew more woodcraft than I ever&#10;dreamed existed. At six, Mary went over the Sliding Rock without a&#10;quiver, and I have seen strong men balk at that feat. And when&#10;Frank had just turned six he could bring up shillings from the&#10;bottom in three fathoms.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My people in Bora Bora do not like heathen&#8212;they are all&#10;Christians; and I do not like Bora Bora Christians,&#34; he said one&#10;day, when I, with the idea of getting him to spend some of the&#10;money that was rightfully his, had been trying to persuade him to&#10;make a visit to his own island in one of our schooners&#8212;a special&#10;voyage which I had hoped to make a record breaker in the matter of&#10;prodigal expense.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I say one of OUR schooners, though legally at the time they&#10;belonged to me. I struggled long with him to enter into&#10;partnership.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;We have been partners from the day the Petite Jeanne went&#10;down,&#34; he said at last. &#34;But if your heart so wishes, then shall we&#10;become partners by the law. I have no work to do, yet are my&#10;expenses large. I drink and eat and smoke in plenty&#8212;it costs much,&#10;I know. I do not pay for the playing of billiards, for I play on&#10;your table; but still the money goes. Fishing on the reef is only a&#10;rich man&#39;s pleasure. It is shocking, the cost of hooks and cotton&#10;line. Yes; it is necessary that we be partners by the law. I need&#10;the money. I shall get it from the head clerk in the office.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So the papers were made out and recorded. A year later I was&#10;compelled to complain.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Charley,&#34; said I, &#34;you are a wicked old fraud, a miserly&#10;skinflint, a miserable land crab. Behold, your share for the year&#10;in all our partnership has been thousands of dollars. The head&#10;clerk has given me this paper. It says that in the year you have&#10;drawn just eighty-seven dollars and twenty cents.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Is there any owing me?&#34; he asked anxiously.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I tell you thousands and thousands,&#34; I answered.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;His face brightened, as with an immense relief.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It is well,&#34; he said. &#34;See that the head clerk keeps good&#10;account of it. When I want it, I shall want it, and there must not&#10;be a cent missing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;If there is,:&#34; he added fiercely, after a pause, &#34;it must come&#10;out of the clerk&#39;s wages.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And all the time, as I afterwards learned, his will, drawn up by&#10;Carruthers, and making me sole beneficiary, lay in the American&#10;consul&#39;s safe.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But the end came, as the end must come to all human&#10;associations.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It occurred in the Solomons, where our wildest work had been&#10;done in the wild young days, and where we were once more&#8212;&#10;principally on a holiday, incidentally to look after our holdings&#10;on Florida Island and to look over the pearling possibilities of&#10;the Mboli Pass. We were lying at Savo, having run in to trade for&#10;curios.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now, Savo is alive with sharks. The custom of the woolly-heads&#10;of burying their dead in the sea did not tend to discourage the&#10;sharks from making the adjacent waters a hangout. It was my luck to&#10;be coming aboard in a tiny, overloaded, native canoe, when the&#10;thing capsized. There were four woolly-heads and myself in it, or&#10;rather, hanging to it. The schooner was a hundred yards away.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I was just hailing for a boat when one of the woolly-heads began&#10;to scream. Holding on to the end of the canoe, both he and that&#10;portion of the canoe were dragged under several times. Then he&#10;loosed his clutch and disappeared. A shark had got him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The three remaining niggers tried to climb out of the water upon&#10;the bottom of the canoe. I yelled and cursed and struck at the&#10;nearest with my fist, but it was no use. They were in a blind funk.&#10;The canoe could barely have supported one of them. Under the three&#10;it upended and rolled sidewise, throwing them back into the&#10;water.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I abandoned the canoe and started to swim toward the schooner,&#10;expecting to be picked up by the boat before I got there. One of&#10;the niggers elected to come with me, and we swam along silently,&#10;side by side, now and again putting our faces into the water and&#10;peering about for sharks. The screams of the man who stayed by the&#10;canoe informed us that he was taken. I was peering into the water&#10;when I saw a big shark pass directly beneath me. He was fully&#10;sixteen feet in length. I saw the whole thing. He got the&#10;woolly-head by the middle, and away he went, the poor devil, head,&#10;shoulders, and arms out of the water all the time, screeching in a&#10;heart-rending way. He was carried along in this fashion for several&#10;hundred feet, when he was dragged beneath the surface.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I swam doggedly on, hoping that that was the last unattached&#10;shark. But there was another. Whether it was one that had attacked&#10;the natives earlier, or whether it was one that had made a good&#10;meal elsewhere, I do not know. At any rate, he was not in such&#10;haste as the others. I could not swim so rapidly now, for a large&#10;part of my effort was devoted to keeping track of him. I was&#10;watching him when he made his first attack. By good luck I got both&#10;hands on his nose, and, though his momentum nearly shoved me under,&#10;I managed to keep him off. He veered clear, and began circling&#10;about again. A second time I escaped him by the same manoeuvre. The&#10;third rush was a miss on both sides. He sheered at the moment my&#10;hands should have landed on his nose, but his sandpaper hide (I had&#10;on a sleeveless undershirt) scraped the skin off one arm from elbow&#10;to shoulder.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;By this time I was played out, and gave up hope. The schooner&#10;was still two hundred feet away. My face was in the water, and I&#10;was watching him manoeuvre for another attempt, when I saw a brown&#10;body pass between us. It was Otoo.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Swim for the schooner, master!&#34; he said. And he spoke gayly, as&#10;though the affair was a mere lark. &#34;I know sharks. The shark is my&#10;brother.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I obeyed, swimming slowly on, while Otoo swam about me, keeping&#10;always between me and the shark, foiling his rushes and encouraging&#10;me.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The davit tackle carried away, and they are rigging the falls,&#34;&#10;he explained, a minute or so later, and then went under to head off&#10;another attack.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;By the time the schooner was thirty feet away I was about done&#10;for. I could scarcely move. They were heaving lines at us from on&#10;board, but they continually fell short. The shark, finding that it&#10;was receiving no hurt, had become bolder. Several times it nearly&#10;got me, but each time Otoo was there just the moment before it was&#10;too late. Of course, Otoo could have saved himself any time. But he&#10;stuck by me.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Good-by, Charley! I&#39;m finished!&#34; I just managed to gasp.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I knew that the end had come, and that the next moment I should&#10;throw up my hands and go down.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But Otoo laughed in my face, saying:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I will show you a new trick. I will make that shark feel&#10;sick!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He dropped in behind me, where the shark was preparing to come&#10;at me.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;A little more to the left!&#34; he next called out. &#34;There is a&#10;line there on the water. To the left, master&#8212;to the left!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I changed my course and struck out blindly. I was by that time&#10;barely conscious. As my hand closed on the line I heard an&#10;exclamation from on board. I turned and looked. There was no sign&#10;of Otoo. The next instant he broke surface. Both hands were off at&#10;the wrist, the stumps spouting blood.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Otoo!&#34; he called softly. And I could see in his gaze the love&#10;that thrilled in his voice.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then, and then only, at the very last of all our years, he&#10;called me by that name.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Good-by, Otoo!&#34; he called.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then he was dragged under, and I was hauled aboard, where I&#10;fainted in the captain&#39;s arms.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And so passed Otoo, who saved me and made me a man, and who&#10;saved me in the end. We met in the maw of a hurricane, and parted&#10;in the maw of a shark, with seventeen intervening years of&#10;comradeship, the like of which I dare to assert has never befallen&#10;two men, the one brown and the other white. If Jehovah be from His&#10;high place watching every sparrow fall, not least in His kingdom&#10;shall be Otoo, the one heathen of Bora Bora.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 9, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/1176', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('The Terrible Solomons'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;There is no gainsaying that the Solomons are a hard-bitten bunch&#10;of islands. On the other hand, there are worse places in the world.&#10;But to the new chum who has no constitutional understanding of men&#10;and life in the rough, the Solomons may indeed prove terrible.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It is true that fever and dysentery are perpetually on the&#10;walk-about, that loathsome skin diseases abound, that the air is&#10;saturated with a poison that bites into every pore, cut, or&#10;abrasion and plants malignant ulcers, and that many strong men who&#10;escape dying there return as wrecks to their own countries. It is&#10;also true that the natives of the Solomons are a wild lot, with a&#10;hearty appetite for human flesh and a fad for collecting human&#10;heads. Their highest instinct of sportsmanship is to catch a man&#10;with his back turned and to smite him a cunning blow with a&#10;tomahawk that severs the spinal column at the base of the brain. It&#10;is equally true that on some islands, such as Malaita, the profit&#10;and loss account of social intercourse is calculated in homicides.&#10;Heads are a medium of exchange, and white heads are extremely&#10;valuable. Very often a dozen villages make a jack-pot, which they&#10;fatten moon by moon, against the time when some brave warrior&#10;presents a white man&#39;s head, fresh and gory, and claims the&#10;pot.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;All the foregoing is quite true, and yet there are white men who&#10;have lived in the Solomons a score of years and who feel homesick&#10;when they go away from them. A man needs only to be careful&#8212; and&#10;lucky&#8212;to live a long time in the Solomons; but he must also be of&#10;the right sort. He must have the hallmark of the inevitable white&#10;man stamped upon his soul. He must be inevitable. He must have a&#10;certain grand carelessness of odds, a certain colossal&#10;self-satisfaction, and a racial egotism that convinces him that one&#10;white is better than a thousand niggers every day in the week, and&#10;that on Sunday he is able to clean out two thousand niggers. For&#10;such are the things that have made the white man inevitable. Oh,&#10;and one other thing&#8212;the white man who wishes to be inevitable, must&#10;not merely despise the lesser breeds and think a lot of himself; he&#10;must also fail to be too long on imagination. He must not&#10;understand too well the instincts, customs, and mental processes of&#10;the blacks, the yellows, and the browns; for it is not in such&#10;fashion that the white race has tramped its royal road around the&#10;world.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Bertie Arkwright was not inevitable. He was too sensitive, too&#10;finely strung, and he possessed too much imagination. The world was&#10;too much with him. He projected himself too quiveringly into his&#10;environment. Therefore, the last place in the world for him to come&#10;was the Solomons. He did not come, expecting to stay. A five weeks&#39;&#10;stop-over between steamers, he decided, would satisfy the call of&#10;the primitive he felt thrumming the strings of his being. At least,&#10;so he told the lady tourists on the MAKEMBO, though in different&#10;terms; and they worshipped him as a hero, for they were lady&#10;tourists and they would know only the safety of the steamer&#39;s deck&#10;as she threaded her way through the Solomons.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There was another man on board, of whom the ladies took no&#10;notice. He was a little shriveled wisp of a man, with a withered&#10;skin the color of mahogany. His name on the passenger list does not&#10;matter, but his other name, Captain Malu, was a name for niggers to&#10;conjure with, and to scare naughty pickaninnies to righteousness&#10;from New Hanover to the New Hebrides. He had farmed savages and&#10;savagery, and from fever and hardship, the crack of Sniders and the&#10;lash of the overseers, had wrested five millions of money in the&#10;form of b&#710;che-de-mer, sandalwood, pearl-shell and turtle-shell,&#10;ivory nuts and copra, grasslands, trading stations, and&#10;plantations. Captain Malu&#39;s little finger, which was broken, had&#10;more inevitableness in it than Bertie Arkwright&#39;s whole carcass.&#10;But then, the lady tourists had nothing by which to judge save&#10;appearances, and Bertie certainly was a fine-looking man.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Bertie talked with Captain Malu in the smoking room, confiding&#10;to him his intention of seeing life red and bleeding in the&#10;Solomons. Captain Malu agreed that the intention was ambitious and&#10;honorable. It was not until several days later that he became&#10;interested in Bertie, when that young adventurer insisted on&#10;showing him an automatic 44-caliber pistol. Bertie explained the&#10;mechanism and demonstrated by slipping a loaded magazine up the&#10;hollow butt.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It is so simple,&#34; he said. He shot the outer barrel back along&#10;the inner one. &#34;That loads it and cocks it, you see. And then all I&#10;have to do is pull the trigger, eight times, as fast as I can&#10;quiver my finger. See that safety clutch. That&#39;s what I like about&#10;it. It is safe. It is positively fool-proof.&#34; He slipped out the&#10;magazine. &#34;You see how safe it is.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As he held it in his hand, the muzzle came in line with Captain&#10;Malu&#39;s stomach. Captain Malu&#39;s blue eyes looked at it&#10;unswervingly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Would you mind pointing it in some other direction?&#34; he&#10;asked.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It&#39;s perfectly safe,&#34; Bertie assured him. &#34;I withdrew the&#10;magazine. It&#39;s not loaded now, you know.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;A gun is always loaded.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But this one isn&#39;t.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Turn it away just the same.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Captain Malu&#39;s voice was flat and metallic and low, but his eyes&#10;never left the muzzle until the line of it was drawn past him and&#10;away from him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I&#39;ll bet a fiver it isn&#39;t loaded,&#34; Bertie proposed warmly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The other shook his head.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Then I&#39;ll show you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Bertie started to put the muzzle to his own temple with the&#10;evident intention of pulling the trigger.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Just a second,&#34; Captain Malu said quietly, reaching out his&#10;hand. &#34;Let me look at it.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He pointed it seaward and pulled the trigger. A heavy explosion&#10;followed, instantaneous with the sharp click of the mechanism that&#10;flipped a hot and smoking cartridge sidewise along the deck.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Bertie&#39;s jaw dropped in amazement.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I slipped the barrel back once, didn&#39;t I?&#34; he explained. It was&#10;silly of me, I must say.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He giggled flabbily, and sat down in a steamer chair. The blood&#10;had ebbed from his face, exposing dark circles under his eyes. His&#10;hands were trembling and unable to guide the shaking cigarette to&#10;his lips. The world was too much with him, and he saw himself with&#10;dripping brains prone upon the deck&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Really,&#34; he said, &#34;&#8230; really.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It&#39;s a pretty weapon,&#34; said Captain Malu, returning the&#10;automatic to him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Commissioner was on board the Makembo, returning from&#10;Sydney, and by his permission a stop was made at Ugi to land a&#10;missionary. And at Ugi lay the ketch ARLA, Captain Hansen, skipper.&#10;Now the Arla was one of many vessels owned by Captain Malu, and it&#10;was at his suggestion and by his invitation that Bertie went aboard&#10;the Arla as guest for a four days&#39; recruiting cruise on the coast&#10;of Malaita. Thereafter the ARLA would drop him at Reminge&#10;Plantation (also owned by Captain Malu), where Bertie could remain&#10;for a week, and then be sent over to Tulagi, the seat of&#10;government, where he would become the Commissioner&#39;s guest. Captain&#10;Malu was responsible for two other suggestions, which given, he&#10;disappears from this narrative. One was to Captain Hansen, the&#10;other to Mr. Harriwell, manager of Reminge Plantation. Both&#10;suggestions were similar in tenor, namely, to give Mr. Bertram&#10;Arkwright an insight into the rawness and redness of life in the&#10;Solomons. Also, it is whispered that Captain Malu mentioned that a&#10;case of Scotch would be coincidental with any particularly gorgeous&#10;insight Mr. Arkwright might receive&#8230; &#38;#160;&#8230; &#38;#160;&#8230; &#38;#160;&#8230; .&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, Swartz always was too pig-headed. You see, he took four of&#10;his boat&#39;s crew to Tulagi to be flogged&#8212;officially, you know&#8212;then&#10;started back with them in the whaleboat. It was pretty squally, and&#10;the boat capsized just outside. Swartz was the only one drowned. Of&#10;course, it was an accident.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Was it? Really?&#34; Bertie asked, only half-interested, staring&#10;hard at the black man at the wheel.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Ugi had dropped astern, and the ARLA was sliding along through a&#10;summer sea toward the wooded ranges of Malaita. The helmsman who so&#10;attracted Bertie&#39;s eyes sported a ten penny nail, stuck skewerwise&#10;through his nose. About his neck was a string of pants buttons.&#10;Thrust through holes in his ears were a can opener, the broken&#10;handle of a toothbrush, a clay pipe, the brass wheel of an alarm&#10;clock, and several Winchester rifle cartridges.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;On his chest, suspended from around his neck hung the half of a&#10;china plate. Some forty similarly appareled blacks lay about the&#10;deck, fifteen of which were boat&#39;s crew, the remainder being fresh&#10;labor recruits.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Of course it was an accident,&#34; spoke up the ARLA&#39;S mate,&#10;Jacobs, a slender, dark-eyed man who looked more a professor than a&#10;sailor. &#34;Johnny Bedip nearly had the same kind of accident. He was&#10;bringing back several from a flogging, when they capsized him. But&#10;he knew how to swim as well as they, and two of them were drowned.&#10;He used a boat stretcher and a revolver. Of course it was an&#10;accident.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Quite common, them accidents,&#34; remarked the skipper. &#34;You see&#10;that man at the wheel, Mr. Arkwright? He&#39;s a man eater. Six months&#10;ago, he and the rest of the boat&#39;s crew drowned the then captain of&#10;the ARLA. They did it on deck, sir, right aft there by the&#10;mizzen-traveler.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The deck was in a shocking state,&#34; said the mate.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Do I understand&#8212;?&#34; Bertie began.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, just that,&#34; said Captain Hansen. &#34;It was an accidental&#10;drowning.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But on deck&#8212;?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Just so. I don&#39;t mind telling you, in confidence, of course,&#10;that they used an axe.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;This present crew of yours?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Captain Hansen nodded.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The other skipper always was too careless,&#34; explained the mate.&#10;He but just turned his back, when they let him have it.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;We haven&#39;t any show down here,&#34; was the skipper&#39;s complaint.&#10;&#34;The government protects a nigger against a white every time. You&#10;can&#39;t shoot first. You&#39;ve got to give the nigger first shot, or&#10;else the government calls it murder and you go to Fiji. That&#39;s why&#10;there&#39;s so many drowning accidents.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Dinner was called, and Bertie and the skipper went below,&#10;leaving the mate to watch on deck.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Keep an eye out for that black devil, Auiki,&#34; was the skipper&#39;s&#10;parting caution. &#34;I haven&#39;t liked his looks for several days.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Right O,&#34; said the mate.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Dinner was part way along, and the skipper was in the middle of&#10;his story of the cutting out of the Scottish Chiefs.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes,&#34; he was saying, &#34;she was the finest vessel on the coast.&#10;But when she missed stays, and before ever she hit the reef, the&#10;canoes started for her. There were five white men, a crew of twenty&#10;Santa Cruz boys and Samoans, and only the supercargo escaped.&#10;Besides, there were sixty recruits. They were all kai-kai&#39;d.&#10;Kai-kai?&#8212;oh, I beg your pardon. I mean they were eaten. Then there&#10;was the James Edwards, a dandy-rigged&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But at that moment there was a sharp oath from the mate on deck&#10;and a chorus of savage cries. A revolver went off three times, and&#10;then was heard a loud splash. Captain Hansen had sprung up the&#10;companionway on the instant, and Bertie&#39;s eyes had been fascinated&#10;by a glimpse of him drawing his revolver as he sprang.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Bertie went up more circumspectly, hesitating before he put his&#10;head above the companionway slide. But nothing happened. The mate&#10;was shaking with excitement, his revolver in his hand. Once he&#10;startled, and half-jumped around, as if danger threatened his&#10;back.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;One of the natives fell overboard,&#34; he was saying, in a queer&#10;tense voice. &#34;He couldn&#39;t swim.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Who was it?&#34; the skipper demanded.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Auiki,&#34; was the answer.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But I say, you know, I heard shots,&#34; Bertie said, in trembling&#10;eagerness, for he scented adventure, and adventure that was happily&#10;over with.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The mate whirled upon him, snarling:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It&#34;s a damned lie. There ain&#39;t been a shot fired. The nigger&#10;fell overboard.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Captain Hansen regarded Bertie with unblinking, lack-luster&#10;eyes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I&#8212;I thought&#8212;&#34; Bertie was beginning.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Shots?&#34; said Captain Hansen, dreamily. &#34;Shots? Did you hear any&#10;shots, Mr. Jacobs?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Not a shot,&#34; replied Mr. Jacobs.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The skipper looked at his guest triumphantly, and said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Evidently an accident. Let us go down, Mr. Arkwright, and&#10;finish dinner.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Bertie slept that night in the captain&#39;s cabin, a tiny stateroom&#10;off the main cabin. The for&#39;ard bulkhead was decorated with a stand&#10;of rifles. Over the bunk were three more rifles. Under the bunk was&#10;a big drawer, which, when he pulled it out, he found filled with&#10;ammunition, dynamite, and several boxes of detonators. He elected&#10;to take the settee on the opposite side. Lying conspicuously on the&#10;small table, was the Arla&#39;s log. Bertie did not know that it had&#10;been especially prepared for the occasion by Captain Malu, and he&#10;read therein how on September 21, two boat&#39;s crew had fallen&#10;overboard and been drowned. Bertie read between the lines and knew&#10;better. He read how the Arla&#39;s whale boat had been bushwhacked at&#10;Su&#39;u and had lost three men; of how the skipper discovered the cook&#10;stewing human flesh on the galley fire&#8212;flesh purchased by the&#10;boat&#39;s crew ashore in Fui; of how an accidental discharge of&#10;dynamite, while signaling, had killed another boat&#39;s crew; of night&#10;attacks; ports fled from between the dawns; attacks by bushmen in&#10;mangrove swamps and by fleets of salt-water men in the larger&#10;passages. One item that occurred with monotonous frequency was&#10;death by dysentery. He noticed with alarm that two white men had so&#10;died&#8212;guests, like himself, on the Arla.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I say, you know,&#34; Bertie said next day to Captain Hansen. &#34;I&#39;ve&#10;been glancing through your log.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The skipper displayed quick vexation that the log had been left&#10;lying about.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And all that dysentery, you know, that&#39;s all rot, just like the&#10;accidental drownings,&#34; Bertie continued. &#34;What does dysentery&#10;really stand for?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The skipper openly admired his guest&#39;s acumen, stiffened himself&#10;to make indignant denial, then gracefully surrendered.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You see, it&#39;s like this, Mr. Arkwright. These islands have got&#10;a bad enough name as it is. It&#39;s getting harder every day to sign&#10;on white men. Suppose a man is killed. The company has to pay&#10;through the nose for another man to take the job. But if the man&#10;merely dies of sickness, it&#39;s all right. The new chums don&#39;t mind&#10;disease. What they draw the line at is being murdered. I thought&#10;the skipper of the Arla had died of dysentery when I took his&#10;billet. Then it was too late. I&#39;d signed the contract.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Besides,&#34; said Mr. Jacobs, &#34;there&#39;s altogether too many&#10;accidental drownings anyway. It don&#39;t look right. It&#39;s the fault of&#10;the government. A white man hasn&#39;t a chance to defend himself from&#10;the niggers.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, look at the Princess and that Yankee mate,&#34; the skipper&#10;took up the tale. &#34;She carried five white men besides a government&#10;agent. The captain, the agent, and the supercargo were ashore in&#10;the two boats. They were killed to the last man. The mate and&#10;boson, with about fifteen of the crew&#8212;Samoans and Tongans&#8212;were on&#10;board. A crowd of niggers came off from shore. First thing the mate&#10;knew, the boson and the crew were killed in the first rush. The&#10;mate grabbed three cartridge belts and two Winchesters and skinned&#10;up to the cross-trees. He was the sole survivor, and you can&#39;t&#10;blame him for being mad. He pumped one rifle till it got so hot he&#10;couldn&#39;t hold it, then he pumped the other. The deck was black with&#10;niggers. He cleaned them out. He dropped them as they went over the&#10;rail, and he dropped them as fast as they picked up their paddles.&#10;Then they jumped into the water and started to swim for it, and&#10;being mad, he got half a dozen more. And what did he get for&#10;it?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Seven years in Fiji,&#34; snapped the mate.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The government said he wasn&#39;t justified in shooting after&#10;they&#39;d taken to the water,&#34; the skipper explained.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And that&#39;s why they die of dysentery nowadays,&#34; the mate&#10;added.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Just fancy,&#34; said Bertie, as he felt a longing for the cruise&#10;to be over.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Later on in the day he interviewed the black who had been&#10;pointed out to him as a cannibal. This fellow&#39;s name was Sumasai.&#10;He had spent three years on a Queensland plantation. He had been to&#10;Samoa, and Fiji, and Sydney; and as a boat&#39;s crew had been on&#10;recruiting schooners through New Britain, New Ireland, New Guinea,&#10;and the Admiralties. Also, he was a wag, and he had taken a line on&#10;his skipper&#39;s conduct. Yes, he had eaten many men. How many? He&#10;could not remember the tally. Yes, white men, too; they were very&#10;good, unless they were sick. He had once eaten a sick one.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My word!&#34; he cried, at the recollection. &#34;Me sick plenty along&#10;him. &#39;my belly walk about too much.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Bertie shuddered, and asked about heads. Yes, Sumasai had&#10;several hidden ashore, in good condition, sun-dried, and&#10;smoke-cured. One was of the captain of a schooner. It had long&#10;whiskers. He would sell it for two quid. Black men&#39;s heads he would&#10;sell for one quid. He had some pickaninny heads, in poor condition,&#10;that he would let go for ten bob.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Five minutes afterward, Bertie found himself sitting on the&#10;companionway-slide alongside a black with a horrible skin disease.&#10;He sheered off, and on inquiry was told that it was leprosy. He&#10;hurried below and washed himself with antiseptic soap. He took many&#10;antiseptic washes in the course of the day, for every native on&#10;board was afflicted with malignant ulcers of one sort or&#10;another.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As the Arla drew in to an anchorage in the midst of mangrove&#10;swamps, a double row of barbed wire was stretched around above her&#10;rail. That looked like business, and when Bertie saw the shore&#10;canoes alongside, armed with spears, bows and arrows, and Sniders,&#10;he wished more earnestly than ever that the cruise was over.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;That evening the natives were slow in leaving the ship at&#10;sundown. A number of them checked the mate when he ordered them&#10;ashore. &#34;Never mind, I&#39;ll fix them,&#34; said Captain Hansen, diving&#10;below.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When he cam back, he showed Bertie a stick of dynamite attached&#10;to a fish hook. Now it happens that a paper-wrapped bottle of&#10;chlorodyne with a piece of harmless fuse projecting can fool&#10;anybody. It fooled Bertie, and it fooled the natives. When Captain&#10;Hansen lighted the fuse and hooked the fish hook into the tail end&#10;of a native&#39;s loin cloth, that native was smitten with so an ardent&#10;a desire for the shore that he forgot to shed the loin cloth. He&#10;started for&#39;ard, the fuse sizzling and spluttering at his rear, the&#10;natives in his path taking headers over the barbed wire at every&#10;jump. Bertie was horror-stricken. So was Captain Hansen. He had&#10;forgotten his twenty-five recruits, on each of which he had paid&#10;thirty shillings advance. They went over the side along with the&#10;shore-dwelling folk and followed by him who trailed the sizzling&#10;chlorodyne bottle.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Bertie did not see the bottle go off; but the mate opportunely&#10;discharging a stick of real dynamite aft where it would harm&#10;nobody, Bertie would have sworn in any admiralty court to a nigger&#10;blown to flinders. The flight of the twenty-five recruits had&#10;actually cost the Arla forty pounds, and, since they had taken to&#10;the bush, there was no hope of recovering them. The skipper and his&#10;mate proceeded to drown their sorrow in cold tea.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The cold tea was in whiskey bottles, so Bertie did not know it&#10;was cold tea they were mopping up. All he knew was that the two men&#10;got very drunk and argued eloquently and at length as to whether&#10;the exploded nigger should be reported as a case of dysentery or as&#10;an accidental drowning. When they snored off to sleep, he was the&#10;only white man left, and he kept a perilous watch till dawn, in&#10;fear of an attack from shore and an uprising of the crew.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Three more days the Arla spent on the coast, and three more&#10;nights the skipper and the mate drank overfondly of cold tea,&#10;leaving Bertie to keep the watch. They knew he could be depended&#10;upon, while he was equally certain that if he lived, he would&#10;report their drunken conduct to Captain Malu. Then the Arla dropped&#10;anchor at Reminge Plantation, on Guadalcanar, and Bertie landed on&#10;the beach with a sigh of relief and shook hands with the manager.&#10;&#39;mr. Harriwell was ready for him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Now you mustn&#39;t be alarmed if some of our fellows seem&#10;downcast,&#34; Mr. Harriwell said, having drawn him aside in&#10;confidence. &#34;There&#39;s been talk of an outbreak, and two or three&#10;suspicious signs I&#39;m willing to admit, but personally I think it&#39;s&#10;all poppycock.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;How&#8212;how many blacks have you on the plantation?&#34; Bertie asked,&#10;with a sinking heart.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;We&#39;re working four hundred just now,&#34; replied Mr. Harriwell,&#10;cheerfully; but the three of us, with you, of course, and the&#10;skipper and mate of the Arla, can handle them all right.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Bertie turned to meet one McTavish, the storekeeper, who&#10;scarcely acknowledged the introduction, such was his eagerness to&#10;present his resignation.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It being that I&#39;m a married man, Mr. Harriwell, I can&#39;t very&#10;well afford to remain on longer. Trouble is working up, as plain as&#10;the nose on your face. The niggers are going to break out, and&#10;there&#39;ll be another Hohono horror here.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What&#39;s a Hohono horror?&#34; Bertie asked, after the storekeeper&#10;had been persuaded to remain until the end of the month.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh, he means Hohono Plantation, on Ysabel,&#34; said the manager.&#10;&#34;The niggers killed the five white men ashore, captured the&#10;schooner, killed the captain and mate, and escaped in a body to&#10;Malaita. But I always said they were careless on Hohono. They won&#39;t&#10;catch us napping here. Come along, Mr. Arkwright, and see our view&#10;from the veranda.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Bertie was too busy wondering how he could get away to Tulagi to&#10;the Commissioner&#39;s house, to see much of the view. He was still&#10;wondering, when a rifle exploded very near to him, behind his back.&#10;At the same moment his arm was nearly dislocated, so eagerly did&#10;Mr. Harriwell drag him indoors.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I say, old man, that was a close shave,&#34; said the manager,&#10;pawing him over to see if he had been hit. &#34;I can&#39;t tell you how&#10;sorry I am. But it was broad daylight, and I never dreamed.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Bertie was beginning to turn pale.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;They got the other manager that way,&#34; McTavish vouchsafed. &#34;And&#10;a dashed fine chap he was. Blew his brains out all over the&#10;veranda. You noticed that dark stain there between the steps and&#10;the door?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Bertie was ripe for the cocktail which Mr. Harriwell pitched in&#10;and compounded for him; but before he could drink it, a man in&#10;riding trousers and puttees entered.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What&#39;s the matter now?&#34; the manager asked, after one look at&#10;the newcomer&#39;s face. &#34;Is the river up again?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;River be blowed&#8212;it&#39;s the niggers. Stepped out of the cane&#10;grass, not a dozen feet away, and whopped at me. It was a Snider,&#10;and he shot from the hip. Now what I want to know is where&#39;d he get&#10;that Snider?&#8212;Oh, I beg pardon. Glad to know you, Mr.&#10;Arkwright.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Mr. Brown is my assistant,&#34; explained Mr. Harriwell. &#34;And now&#10;let&#39;s have that drink.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But where&#39;d he get that Snider?&#34; Mr. Brown insisted. &#34;I always&#10;objected to keeping those guns on the premises.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;They&#39;re still there,&#34; Mr. Harriwell said, with a show of&#10;heat.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Brown smiled incredulously.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Come along and see,&#34; said the manager.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Bertie joined the procession into the office, where Mr.&#10;Harriwell pointed triumphantly at a big packing case in a dusty&#10;corner.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well, then where did the beggar get that Snider?&#34; harped Mr.&#10;Brown.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But just then McTavish lifted the packing case. The manager&#10;started, then tore off the lid. The case was empty. They gazed at&#10;one another in horrified silence. Harriwell drooped wearily.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then McVeigh cursed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What I contended all along&#8212;the house-boys are not to be&#10;trusted.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It does look serious,&#34; Harriwell admitted, &#34;but we&#39;ll come&#10;through it all right. What the sanguinary niggers need is a shaking&#10;up. Will you gentlemen please bring your rifles to dinner, and will&#10;you, Mr. Brown, kindly prepare forty or fifty sticks of dynamite.&#10;&#39;make the fuses good and short. We&#39;ll give them a lesson. And now,&#10;gentlemen, dinner is served.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;One thing that Bertie detested was rice and curry, so it&#10;happened that he alone partook of an inviting omelet. He had quite&#10;finished his plate, when Harriwell helped himself to the omelet.&#10;One mouthful he tasted, then spat out vociferously.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That&#39;s the second time,&#34; McTavish announced ominously.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Harriwell was still hawking and spitting.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Second time, what?&#34; Bertie quavered.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Poison,&#34; was the answer. &#34;That cook will be hanged yet.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That&#39;s the way the bookkeeper went out at Cape March,&#34; Brown&#10;spoke up. &#34;Died horribly. They said on the Jessie that they heard&#10;him screaming three miles away.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I&#39;ll put the cook in irons,&#34; sputtered Harriwell. &#34;Fortunately&#10;we discovered it in time.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Bertie sat paralyzed. There was no color in his face. He&#10;attempted to speak, but only an inarticulate gurgle resulted. All&#10;eyed him anxiously.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Don&#39;t say it, don&#39;t say it,&#34; McTavish cried in a tense&#10;voice.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, I ate it, plenty of it, a whole plateful!&#34; Bertie cried&#10;explosively, like a diver suddenly regaining breath.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The awful silence continued half a minute longer, and he read&#10;his fate in their eyes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Maybe it wasn&#39;t poison after all,&#34; said Harriwell,&#10;dismally.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Call in the cook,&#34; said Brown.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In came the cook, a grinning black boy, nose-spiked and&#10;ear-plugged.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Here, you, Wi-wi, what name that?&#34; Harriwell bellowed, pointing&#10;accusingly at the omelet.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Wi-wi was very naturally frightened and embarrassed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Him good fella kai-kai,&#34; he murmured apologetically.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Make him eat it,&#34; suggested McTavish. &#34;That&#39;s a proper&#10;test.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Harriwell filled a spoon with the stuff and jumped for the cook,&#10;who fled in panic.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That settles it,&#34; was Brown&#39;s solemn pronouncement. &#34;He won&#39;t&#10;eat it.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Mr. Brown, will you please go and put the irons on him?&#34;&#10;Harriwell turned cheerfully to Bertie. &#34;It&#39;s all right, old man,&#10;the Commissioner will deal with him, and if you die, depend upon&#10;it, he will be hanged.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Don&#39;t think the government&#39;ll do it,&#34; objected McTavish.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But gentlemen, gentlemen,&#34; Bertie cried. &#34;In the meantime think&#10;of me.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Harriwell shrugged his shoulders pityingly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Sorry, old man, but it&#39;s a native poison, and there are no&#10;known antidotes for native poisons. Try and compose yourself and&#10;if&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Two sharp reports of a rifle from without, interrupted the&#10;discourse, and Brown, entering, reloaded his rifle and sat down to&#10;table.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The cook&#39;s dead,&#34; he said. &#34;Fever. A rather sudden attack.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I was just telling Mr. Arkwright that there are no antidotes&#10;for native poisons&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Except gin,&#34; said Brown.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Harriwell called himself an absent-minded idiot and rushed for&#10;the gin bottle.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Neat, man, neat,&#34; he warned Bertie, who gulped down a tumbler&#10;two-thirds full of the raw spirits, and coughed and choked from the&#10;angry bite of it till the tears ran down his cheeks.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Harriwell took his pulse and temperature, made a show of looking&#10;out for him, and doubted that the omelet had been poisoned. Brown&#10;and McTavish also doubted; but Bertie discerned an insincere ring&#10;in their voices. His appetite had left him, and he took his own&#10;pulse stealthily under the table. There was no question but what it&#10;was increasing, but he failed to ascribe it to the gin he had&#10;taken. &#39;mcTavish, rifle in hand, went out on the veranda to&#10;reconnoiter.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;They&#39;re massing up at the cook-house,&#34; was his report. &#34;And&#10;they&#39;ve no end of Sniders. &#39;my idea is to sneak around on the other&#10;side and take them in flank. Strike the first blow, you know. Will&#10;you come along, Brown?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Harriwell ate on steadily, while Bertie discovered that his&#10;pulse had leaped up five beats. Nevertheless, he could not help&#10;jumping when the rifles began to go off. Above the scattering of&#10;Sniders could be heard the pumping of Brown&#39;s and McTavish&#39;s&#10;Winchesters&#8212;all against a background of demoniacal screeching and&#10;yelling.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;They&#39;ve got them on the run,&#34; Harriwell remarked, as voices and&#10;gunshots faded away in the distance.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Scarcely were Brown and McTavish back at the table when the&#10;latter reconnoitered.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;They&#39;ve got dynamite,&#34; he said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Then let&#39;s charge them with dynamite,&#34; Harriwell proposed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Thrusting half a dozen sticks each into their pockets and&#10;equipping themselves with lighted cigars, they started for the&#10;door. And just then it happened. They blamed McTavish for it&#10;afterward, and he admitted that the charge had been a trifle&#10;excessive. But at any rate it went off under the house, which&#10;lifted up cornerwise and settled back on its foundations. Half the&#10;china on the table was shattered, while the eight-day clock&#10;stopped. Yelling for vengeance, the three men rushed out into the&#10;night, and the bombardment began.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When they returned, there was no Bertie. He had dragged himself&#10;away to the office, barricaded himself in, and sunk upon the floor&#10;in a gin-soaked nightmare, wherein he died a thousand deaths while&#10;the valorous fight went on around him. In the morning, sick and&#10;headachey from the gin, he crawled out to find the sun still in the&#10;sky and God presumable in heaven, for his hosts were alive and&#10;uninjured.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Harriwell pressed him to stay on longer, but Bertie insisted on&#10;sailing immediately on the Arla for Tulagi, where, until the&#10;following steamer day, he stuck close by the Commissioner&#39;s house.&#10;There were lady tourists on the outgoing steamer, and Bertie was&#10;again a hero, while Captain Malu, as usual, passed unnoticed. But&#10;Captain Malu sent back from Sydney two cases of the best Scotch&#10;whiskey on the market, for he was not able to make up his mind as&#10;to whether it was Captain Hansen or Mr Harriwell who had given&#10;Bertie Arkwright the more gorgeous insight into life in the&#10;Solomons.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 9, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/1176', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('The Inevitable White Man'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The black will never understand the white, nor the white the&#10;black, as long as black is black and white is white.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So said Captain Woodward. We sat in the parlor of Charley&#10;Roberts&#39; pub in Apia, drinking long Abu Hameds compounded and&#10;shared with us by the aforesaid Charley Roberts, who claimed the&#10;recipe direct from Stevens, famous for having invented the Abu&#10;Hamed at a time when he was spurred on by Nile thirst&#8212;the Stevens&#10;who was responsible for &#34;With Kitchener to Kartoun,&#34; and who passed&#10;out at the siege of Ladysmith.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Captain Woodward, short and squat, elderly, burned by forty&#10;years of tropic sun, and with the most beautiful liquid brown eyes&#10;I ever saw in a man, spoke from a vast experience. The crisscross&#10;of scars on his bald pate bespoke a tomahawk intimacy with the&#10;black, and of equal intimacy was the advertisement, front and rear,&#10;on the right side of his neck, where an arrow had at one time&#10;entered and been pulled clean through. As he explained, he had been&#10;in a hurry on that occasion&#8212;the arrow impeded his running&#8212;and he&#10;felt that he could not take the time to break off the head and pull&#10;out the shaft the way it had come in. At the present moment he was&#10;commander of the SAVAII, the big steamer that recruited labor from&#10;the westward for the German plantations on Samoa.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Half the trouble is the stupidity of the whites,&#34; said Roberts,&#10;pausing to take a swig from his glass and to curse the Samoan&#10;bar-boy in affectionate terms. &#34;If the white man would lay himself&#10;out a bit to understand the workings of the black man&#39;s mind, most&#10;of the messes would be avoided.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I&#39;ve seen a few who claimed they understood niggers,&#34; Captain&#10;Woodward retorted, &#34;and I always took notice that they were the&#10;first to be kai-kai&#39;d (eaten). Look at the missionaries in New&#10;Guinea and the New Hebrides&#8212;the martyr isle of Erromanga and all&#10;the rest. Look at the Austrian expedition that was cut to pieces in&#10;the Solomons, in the bush of Guadalcanar. And look at the traders&#10;themselves, with a score of years&#39; experience, making their brag&#10;that no nigger would ever get them, and whose heads to this day are&#10;ornamenting the rafters of the canoe houses. There was old Johnny&#10;Simons&#8212;twenty-six years on the raw edges of Melanesia, swore he&#10;knew the niggers like a book and that they&#39;d never do for him, and&#10;he passed out at Marovo Lagoon, New Georgia, had his head sawed off&#10;by a black Mary (woman) and an old nigger with only one leg, having&#10;left the other leg in the mouth of a shark while diving for&#10;dynamited fish. There was Billy Watts, horrible reputation as a&#10;nigger killer, a man to scare the devil. I remember lying at Cape&#10;Little, New Ireland you know, when the niggers stole half a case of&#10;trade-tobacco&#8212;cost him about three dollars and a half. In&#10;retaliation he turned out, shot six niggers, smashed up their war&#10;canoes and burned two villages. And it was at Cape Little, four&#10;years afterward, that he was jumped along with fifty Buku boys he&#10;had with him fishing b&#710;che-de-mer. In five minutes they were all&#10;dead, with the exception of three boys who got away in a canoe.&#10;Don&#39;t talk to me about understanding the nigger. The white man&#39;s&#10;mission is to farm the world, and it&#39;s a big enough job cut out for&#10;him. What time has he got left to understand niggers anyway?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Just so,&#34; said Roberts. &#34;And somehow it doesn&#39;t seem necessary,&#10;after all, to understand the niggers. In direct proportion to the&#10;white man&#39;s stupidity is his success in farming the world&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And putting the fear of God into the nigger&#39;s heart,&#34; Captain&#10;Woodward blurted out. &#34;Perhaps you&#39;re right, Roberts. Perhaps it&#39;s&#10;his stupidity that makes him succeed, and surely one phase of his&#10;stupidity is his inability to understand the niggers. But there&#39;s&#10;one thing sure, the white has to run the niggers whether he&#10;understands them or not. It&#39;s inevitable. It&#39;s fate.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And of course the white man is inevitable&#8212;it&#39;s the niggers&#39;&#10;fate,&#34; Roberts broke in. &#34;Tell the white man there&#39;s pearl shell in&#10;some lagoon infested by ten-thousand howling cannibals, and he&#39;ll&#10;head there all by his lonely, with half a dozen kanaka divers and a&#10;tin alarm clock for chronometer, all packed like sardines on a&#10;commodious, five-ton ketch. Whisper that there&#39;s a gold strike at&#10;the North Pole, and that same inevitable white-skinned creature&#10;will set out at once, armed with pick and shovel, a side of bacon,&#10;and the latest patent rocker&#8212;and what&#39;s more, he&#39;ll get there. Tip&#10;it off to him that there&#39;s diamonds on the red-hot ramparts of&#10;hell, and Mr. White Man will storm the ramparts and set old Satan&#10;himself to pick-and-shovel work. That&#39;s what comes of being stupid&#10;and inevitable.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But I wonder what the black man must think of the&#8212;the&#10;inevitableness,&#34; I said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Captain Woodward broke into quiet laughter. His eyes had a&#10;reminiscent gleam.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I&#39;m just wondering what the niggers of Malu thought and still&#10;must be thinking of the one inevitable white man we had on board&#10;when we visited them in the DUCHESS,&#34; he explained.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Roberts mixed three more Abu Hameds.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That was twenty years ago. Saxtorph was his name. He was&#10;certainly the most stupid man I ever saw, but he was as inevitable&#10;as death. There was only one thing that chap could do, and that was&#10;shoot. I remember the first time I ran into him&#8212;right here in Apia,&#10;twenty years ago. That was before your time, Roberts. I was&#10;sleeping at Dutch Henry&#39;s hotel, down where the market is now. Ever&#10;heard of him? He made a tidy stake smuggling arms in to the rebels,&#10;sold out his hotel, and was killed in Sydney just six weeks&#10;afterward in a saloon row.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But Saxtorph. One night I&#39;d just got to sleep, when a couple of&#10;cats began to sing in the courtyard. It was out of bed and up&#10;window, water jug in hand. But just then I heard the window of the&#10;next room go up. Two shots were fired, and the window was closed. I&#10;fail to impress you with the celerity of the transaction. Ten&#10;seconds at the outside. Up went the window, bang bang went the&#10;revolver, and down went the window. Whoever it was, he had never&#10;stopped to see the effect of his shots. He knew. Do you follow&#10;me?&#8212;he KNEW. There was no more cat concert, and in the morning&#10;there lay the two offenders, stone dead. It was marvelous to me. It&#10;still is marvelous. First, it was starlight, and Saxtorph shot&#10;without drawing a bead; next, he shot so rapidly that the two&#10;reports were like a double report; and finally, he knew he had hit&#10;his marks without looking to see.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Two days afterward he came on board to see me. I was mate,&#10;then, on the Duchess, a whacking big one-hundred-and fifty-ton&#10;schooner, a blackbirder. And let me tell you that blackbirders were&#10;blackbirders in those days. There weren&#39;t any government protection&#10;for US, either. It was rough work, give and take, if we were&#10;finished, and nothing said, and we ran niggers from every south sea&#10;island they didn&#39;t kick us off from. Well, Saxtorph came on board,&#10;John Saxtorph was the name he gave. He was a sandy little man, hair&#10;sandy, complexion sandy, and eyes sandy, too. Nothing striking&#10;about him. His soul was as neutral as his color scheme. He said he&#10;was strapped and wanted to ship on board. Would go cabin boy, cook,&#10;supercargo, or common sailor. Didn&#39;t know anything about any of the&#10;billets, but said that he was willing to learn. I didn&#39;t want him,&#10;but his shooting had so impressed me that I took him as common&#10;sailor, wages three pounds per month.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;He was willing to learn all right, I&#39;ll say that much. But he&#10;was constitutionally unable to learn anything. He could no more box&#10;the compass than I could mix drinks like Roberts here. And as for&#10;steering, he gave me my first gray hairs. I never dared risk him at&#10;the wheel when we were running in a big sea, while full-and-by and&#10;close-and-by were insoluble mysteries. Couldn&#39;t ever tell the&#10;difference between a sheet and a tackle, simply couldn&#39;t. The&#10;fore-throat-jig and the jib-jig were all one to him. Tell him to&#10;slack off the mainsheet, and before you know it, he&#39;d drop the&#10;peak. He fell overboard three times, and he couldn&#39;t swim. But he&#10;was always cheerful, never seasick, and he was the most willing man&#10;I ever knew. He was an uncommunicative soul. Never talked about&#10;himself. His history, so far as we were concerned, began the day he&#10;signed on the DUCHESS. Where he learned to shoot, the stars alone&#10;can tell. He was a Yankee&#8212;that much we knew from the twang in his&#10;speech. And that was all we ever did know.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And now we begin to get to the point. We had bad luck in the&#10;New Hebrides, only fourteen boys for five weeks, and we ran up&#10;before the southeast for the Solomons. &#39;malaita, then as now, was&#10;good recruiting ground, and we ran into Malu, on the northwestern&#10;corner. There&#39;s a shore reef and an outer reef, and a mighty&#10;nervous anchorage; but we made it all right and fired off our&#10;dynamite as a signal to the niggers to come down and be recruited.&#10;In three days we got not a boy. The niggers came off to us in their&#10;canoes by hundreds, but they only laughed when we showed them beads&#10;and calico and hatchets and talked of the delights of plantation&#10;work in Samoa.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;On the fourth day there came a change. Fifty-odd boys signed on&#10;and were billeted in the main-hold, with the freedom of the deck,&#10;of course. And of course, looking back, this wholesale signing on&#10;was suspicious, but at the time we thought some powerful chief had&#10;removed the ban against recruiting. The morning of the fifth day&#10;our two boats went ashore as usual&#8212;one to cover the other, you&#10;know, in case of trouble. And, as usual, the fifty niggers on board&#10;were on deck, loafing, talking, smoking, and sleeping. Saxtorph and&#10;myself, along with four other sailors, were all that were left on&#10;board. The two boats were manned with Gilbert Islanders. In the one&#10;were the captain, the supercargo, and the recruiter. In the other,&#10;which was the covering boat and which lay off shore a hundred&#10;yards, was the second mate. Both boats were well-armed, though&#10;trouble was little expected.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Four of the sailors, including Saxtorph, were scraping the poop&#10;rail. The fifth sailor, rifle in hand, was standing guard by the&#10;water-tank just for&#39;ard of the mainmast. I was for&#39;ard, putting in&#10;the finishing licks on a new jaw for the fore-gaff. I was just&#10;reaching for my pipe where I had laid it down, when I heard a shot&#10;from shore. I straightened up to look. Something struck me on the&#10;back of the head, partially stunning me and knocking me to the&#10;deck. &#39;my first thought was that something had carried away aloft;&#10;but even as I went down, and before I struck the deck, I heard the&#10;devil&#39;s own tattoo of rifles from the boats, and twisting sidewise,&#10;I caught a glimpse of the sailor who was standing guard. Two big&#10;niggers were holding his arms, and a third nigger from behind was&#10;braining him with a tomahawk.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I can see it now, the water-tank, the mainmast, the gang&#10;hanging on to him, the hatchet descending on the back of his head,&#10;and all under the blazing sunlight. I was fascinated by that&#10;growing vision of death. The tomahawk seemed to take a horribly&#10;long time to come down. I saw it land, and the man&#39;s legs give&#10;under him as he crumpled. The niggers held him up by sheer strength&#10;while he was hacked a couple of times more. Then I got two more&#10;hacks on the head and decided that I was dead. So did the brute&#10;that was hacking me. I was too helpless to move, and I lay there&#10;and watched them removing the sentry&#39;s head. I must say they did it&#10;slick enough. They were old hands at the business.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The rifle firing from the boats had ceased, and I made no doubt&#10;that they were finished off and that the end had come to&#10;everything. It was only a matter of moments when they would return&#10;for my head. They were evidently taking the heads from the sailors&#10;aft. Heads are valuable on Malaita, especially white heads. They&#10;have the place of honor in the canoe houses of the salt-water&#10;natives. What particular decorative effect the bushmen get out of&#10;them I didn&#39;t know, but they prize them just as much as the&#10;salt-water crowd.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I had a dim notion of escaping, and I crawled on hands and&#10;knees to the winch, where I managed to drag myself to my feet. From&#10;there I could look aft and see three heads on top the cabin&#8212;the&#10;heads of three sailors I had given orders to for months. The&#10;niggers saw me standing, and started for me. I reached for my&#10;revolver, and found they had taken it. I can&#39;t say that I was&#10;scared. I&#39;ve been near to death several times, but it never seemed&#10;easier than right then. I was half-stunned, and nothing seemed to&#10;matter.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The leading nigger had armed himself with a cleaver from the&#10;galley, and he grimaced like an ape as he prepared to slice me&#10;down. But the slice was never made. He went down on the deck all of&#10;a heap, and I saw the blood gush from his mouth. In a dim way I&#10;heard a rifle go off and continue to go off. Nigger after nigger&#10;went down. &#39;my senses began to clear, and I noted that there was&#10;never a miss. Every time that the rifle went off a nigger dropped.&#10;I sat down on deck beside the winch and looked up. Perched in the&#10;crosstrees was Saxtorph. How he had managed it I can&#39;t imagine, for&#10;he had carried up with him two Winchesters and I don&#39;t know how&#10;many bandoliers of ammunition; and he was now doing the one only&#10;thing in this world that he was fitted to do.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I&#39;ve seen shooting and slaughter, but I never saw anything like&#10;that. I sat by the winch and watched the show. I was weak and&#10;faint, and it seemed to be all a dream. Bang, bang, bang, bang,&#10;went his rifle, and thud, thud, thud, thud, went the niggers to the&#10;deck. It was amazing to see them go down. After their first rush to&#10;get me, when about a dozen had dropped, they seemed paralyzed; but&#10;he never left off pumping his gun. By this time canoes and the two&#10;boats arrived from shore, armed with Sniders, and with Winchesters&#10;which they had captured in the boats. The fusillade they let loose&#10;on Saxtorph was tremendous. Luckily for him the niggers are only&#10;good at close range. They are not used to putting the gun to their&#10;shoulders. They wait until they are right on top of a man, and then&#10;they shoot from the hip. When his rifle got too hot, Saxtorph&#10;changed off. That had been his idea when he carried two rifles up&#10;with him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The astounding thing was the rapidity of his fire. Also, he&#10;never made a miss. If ever anything was inevitable, that man was.&#10;It was the swiftness of it that made the slaughter so appalling.&#10;The niggers did not have time to think. When they did manage to&#10;think, they went over the side in a rush, capsizing the canoes of&#10;course. Saxtorph never let up. The water was covered with them, and&#10;plump, plump, plump, he dropped his bullets into them. Not a single&#10;miss, and I could hear distinctly the thud of every bullet as it&#10;buried in human flesh.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The niggers spread out and headed for the shore, swimming. The&#10;water was carpeted with bobbing heads, and I stood up, as in a&#10;dream, and watched it all&#8212;the bobbing heads and the heads that&#10;ceased to bob. Some of the long shots were magnificent. Only one&#10;man reached the beach, but as he stood up to wade ashore, Saxtorph&#10;got him. It was beautiful. And when a couple of niggers ran down to&#10;drag him out of the water, Saxtorph got them, too.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I thought everything was over then, when I heard the rifle go&#10;off again. A nigger had come out of the cabin companion on the run&#10;for the rail and gone down in the middle of it. The cabin must have&#10;been full of them. I counted twenty. They came up one at a time and&#10;jumped for the rail. But they never got there. It reminded me of&#10;trapshooting. A black body would pop out of the companion, bang&#10;would go Saxtorph&#39;s rifle, and down would go the black body. Of&#10;course, those below did not know what was happening on deck, so&#10;they continued to pop out until the last one was finished off.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Saxtorph waited a while to make sure, and then came down on&#10;deck. He and I were all that were left of the DUCHESS&#39;S complement,&#10;and I was pretty well to the bad, while he was helpless now that&#10;the shooting was over. Under my direction he washed out my scalp&#10;wounds and sewed them up. A big drink of whiskey braced me to make&#10;an effort to get out. There was nothing else to do. All the rest&#10;were dead. We tried to get up sail, Saxtorph hoisting and I holding&#10;the turn. He was once more the stupid lubber. He couldn&#39;t hoist&#10;worth a cent, and when I fell in a faint, it looked all up with&#10;us.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;When I came to, Saxtorph was sitting helplessly on the rail,&#10;waiting to ask me what he should do. I told him to overhaul the&#10;wounded and see if there were any able to crawl. He gathered&#10;together six. One, I remember, had a broken leg; but Saxtorph said&#10;his arms were all right. I lay in the shade, brushing the flies off&#10;and directing operations, while Saxtorph bossed his hospital gang.&#10;I&#39;ll be blessed if he didn&#39;t make those poor niggers heave at every&#10;rope on the pin-rails before he found the halyards. One of them let&#10;go the rope in the midst of the hoisting and slipped down to the&#10;deck dead; but Saxtorph hammered the others and made them stick by&#10;the job. When the fore and main were up, I told him to knock the&#10;shackle out of the anchor chain and let her go. I had had myself&#10;helped aft to the wheel, where I was going to make a shift at&#10;steering. I can&#39;t guess how he did it, but instead of knocking the&#10;shackle out, down went the second anchor, and there we were doubly&#10;moored.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;In the end he managed to knock both shackles out and raise the&#10;staysail and jib, and the Duchess filled away for the entrance. Our&#10;decks were a spectacle. Dead and dying niggers were everywhere.&#10;They were wedged away some of them in the most inconceivable&#10;places. The cabin was full of them where they had crawled off the&#10;deck and cashed in. I put Saxtorph and his graveyard gang to work&#10;heaving them overside, and over they went, the living and the dead.&#10;The sharks had fat pickings that day. Of course our four murdered&#10;sailors went the same way. Their heads, however, we put in a sack&#10;with weights, so that by no chance should they drift on the beach&#10;and fall into the hands of the niggers.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Our five prisoners I decided to use as crew, but they decided&#10;otherwise. They watched their opportunity and went over the side.&#10;Saxtorph got two in mid-air with his revolver, and would have shot&#10;the other three in the water if I hadn&#39;t stopped him. I was sick of&#10;the slaughter, you see, and besides, they&#39;d helped work the&#10;schooner out. But it was mercy thrown away, for the sharks got the&#10;three of them.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I had brain fever or something after we got clear of the land.&#10;Anyway, the DUCHESS lay hove to for three weeks, when I pulled&#10;myself together and we jogged on with her to Sydney. Anyway those&#10;niggers of Malu learned the everlasting lesson that it is not good&#10;to monkey with a white man. In their case, Saxtorph was certainly&#10;inevitable.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Charley Roberts emitted a long whistle and said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well I should say so. But whatever became of Saxtorph?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;He drifted into seal hunting and became a crackerjack. For six&#10;years he was high line of both the Victoria and San Francisco&#10;fleets. The seventh year his schooner was seized in Bering Sea by a&#10;Russian cruiser, and all hands, so the talk went, were slammed into&#10;the Siberian salt mines. At least I&#39;ve never heard of him&#10;since.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Farming the world,&#34; Roberts muttered. &#34;Farming the world. Well&#10;here&#39;s to them. Somebody&#39;s got to do it&#8212;farm the world, I&#10;mean.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Captain Woodward rubbed the criss-crosses on his bald head.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I&#39;ve done my share of it,&#34; he said. &#34;Forty years now. This will&#10;be my last trip. Then I&#39;m going home to stay.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I&#39;ll wager the wine you don&#39;t,&#34; Roberts challenged. &#34;You&#39;ll die&#10;in the harness, not at home.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Captain Woodward promptly accepted the bet, but personally I&#10;think Charley Roberts has the best of it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 9, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/1176', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('The Seed of McCoy'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Pyrenees, her iron sides pressed low in the water by her&#10;cargo of wheat, rolled sluggishly, and made it easy for the man who&#10;was climbing aboard from out a tiny outrigger canoe. As his eyes&#10;came level with the rail, so that he could see inboard, it seemed&#10;to him that he saw a dim, almost indiscernible haze. It was more&#10;like an illusion, like a blurring film that had spread abruptly&#10;over his eyes. He felt an inclination to brush it away, and the&#10;same instant he thought that he was growing old and that it was&#10;time to send to San Francisco for a pair of spectacles.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As he came over the rail he cast a glance aloft at the tall&#10;masts, and, next, at the pumps. They were not working. There seemed&#10;nothing the matter with the big ship, and he wondered why she had&#10;hoisted the signal of distress. He thought of his happy islanders,&#10;and hoped it was not disease. Perhaps the ship was short of water&#10;or provisions. He shook hands with the captain whose gaunt face and&#10;care-worn eyes made no secret of the trouble, whatever it was. At&#10;the same moment the newcomer was aware of a faint, indefinable&#10;smell. It seemed like that of burnt bread, but different.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He glanced curiously about him. Twenty feet away a weary-faced&#10;sailor was calking the deck. As his eyes lingered on the man, he&#10;saw suddenly arise from under his hands a faint spiral of haze that&#10;curled and twisted and was gone. By now he had reached the deck.&#10;His bare feet were pervaded by a dull warmth that quickly&#10;penetrated the thick calluses. He knew now the nature of the ship&#39;s&#10;distress. His eyes roved swiftly forward, where the full crew of&#10;weary-faced sailors regarded him eagerly. The glance from his&#10;liquid brown eyes swept over them like a benediction, soothing&#10;them, rapping them about as in the mantle of a great peace. &#34;How&#10;long has she been afire, Captain?&#34; he asked in a voice so gentle&#10;and unperturbed that it was as the cooing of a dove.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At first the captain felt the peace and content of it stealing&#10;in upon him; then the consciousness of all that he had gone through&#10;and was going through smote him, and he was resentful. By what&#10;right did this ragged beachcomber, in dungaree trousers and a&#10;cotton shirt, suggest such a thing as peace and content to him and&#10;his overwrought, exhausted soul? The captain did not reason this;&#10;it was the unconscious process of emotion that caused his&#10;resentment.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Fifteen days,&#34; he answered shortly. &#34;Who are you?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My name is McCoy,&#34; came the answer in tones that breathed&#10;tenderness and compassion.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I mean, are you the pilot?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;McCoy passed the benediction of his gaze over the tall,&#10;heavy-shouldered man with the haggard, unshaven face who had joined&#10;the captain.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I am as much a pilot as anybody,&#34; was McCoy&#39;s answer. &#34;We are&#10;all pilots here, Captain, and I know every inch of these&#10;waters.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But the captain was impatient.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What I want is some of the authorities. I want to talk with&#10;them, and blame quick.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Then I&#39;ll do just as well.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Again that insidious suggestion of peace, and his ship a raging&#10;furnace beneath his feet! The captain&#39;s eyebrows lifted impatiently&#10;and nervously, and his fist clenched as if he were about to strike&#10;a blow with it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Who in hell are you?&#34; he demanded.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I am the chief magistrate,&#34; was the reply in a voice that was&#10;still the softest and gentlest imaginable.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The tall, heavy-shouldered man broke out in a harsh laugh that&#10;was partly amusement, but mostly hysterical. Both he and the&#10;captain regarded McCoy with incredulity and amazement. That this&#10;barefooted beachcomber should possess such high-sounding dignity&#10;was inconceivable. His cotton shirt, unbuttoned, exposed a grizzled&#10;chest and the fact that there was no undershirt beneath.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A worn straw hat failed to hide the ragged gray hair. Halfway&#10;down his chest descended an untrimmed patriarchal beard. In any&#10;slop shop, two shillings would have outfitted him complete as he&#10;stood before them.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Any relation to the McCoy of the Bounty?&#34; the captain&#10;asked.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;He was my great-grandfather.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh,&#34; the captain said, then bethought himself. &#39;my name is&#10;Davenport, and this is my first mate, Mr. Konig.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;They shook hands.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And now to business.&#34; The captain spoke quickly, the urgency of&#10;a great haste pressing his speech. &#34;We&#39;ve been on fire for over two&#10;weeks. She&#39;s ready to break all hell loose any moment. That&#39;s why I&#10;held for Pitcairn. I want to beach her, or scuttle her, and save&#10;the hull.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Then you made a mistake, Captain, said McCoy. &#34;You should have&#10;slacked away for Mangareva. There&#39;s a beautiful beach there, in a&#10;lagoon where the water is like a mill pond.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But we&#39;re here, ain&#39;t we?&#34; the first mate demanded. &#34;That&#39;s the&#10;point. We&#39;re here, and we&#39;ve got to do something.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;McCoy shook his head kindly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You can do nothing here. There is no beach. There isn&#39;t even&#10;anchorage.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Gammon!&#34; said the mate. &#34;Gammon!&#34; he repeated loudly, as the&#10;captain signaled him to be more soft spoken. &#34;You can&#39;t tell me&#10;that sort of stuff. Where d&#39;ye keep your own boats, hey&#8212;your&#10;schooner, or cutter, or whatever you have? Hey? Answer me&#10;that.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;McCoy smiled as gently as he spoke. His smile was a caress, an&#10;embrace that surrounded the tired mate and sought to draw him into&#10;the quietude and rest of McCoy&#39;s tranquil soul.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;We have no schooner or cutter,&#34; he replied. &#34;And we carry our&#10;canoes to the top of the cliff.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You&#39;ve got to show me,&#34; snorted the mate. &#34;How d&#39;ye get around&#10;to the other islands, heh? Tell me that.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;We don&#39;t get around. As governor of Pitcairn, I sometimes go.&#10;When I was younger, I was away a great deal&#8212;sometimes on the&#10;trading schooners, but mostly on the missionary brig. But she&#39;s&#10;gone now, and we depend on passing vessels. Sometimes we have had&#10;as high as six calls in one year. At other times, a year, and even&#10;longer, has gone by without one passing ship. Yours is the first in&#10;seven months.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And you mean to tell me&#8212;&#34; the mate began.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But Captain Davenport interfered.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Enough of this. We&#39;re losing time. What is to be done, Mr.&#10;McCoy?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The old man turned his brown eyes, sweet as a woman&#39;s,&#10;shoreward, and both captain and mate followed his gaze around from&#10;the lonely rock of Pitcairn to the crew clustering forward and&#10;waiting anxiously for the announcement of a decision. &#39;mcCoy did&#10;not hurry. He thought smoothly and slowly, step by step, with the&#10;certitude of a mind that was never vexed or outraged by life.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The wind is light now,&#34; he said finally. &#34;There is a heavy&#10;current setting to the westward.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That&#39;s what made us fetch to leeward,&#34; the captain interrupted,&#10;desiring to vindicate his seamanship.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, that is what fetched you to leeward,&#34; McCoy went on.&#10;&#34;Well, you can&#39;t work up against this current today. And if you&#10;did, there is no beach. Your ship will be a total loss.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He paused, and captain and mate looked despair at each&#10;other.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But I will tell you what you can do. The breeze will freshen&#10;tonight around midnight&#8212;see those tails of clouds and that&#10;thickness to windward, beyond the point there? That&#39;s where she&#39;ll&#10;come from, out of the southeast, hard. It is three hundred miles to&#10;Mangareva. Square away for it. There is a beautiful bed for your&#10;ship there.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The mate shook his head.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Come in to the cabin, and we&#39;ll look at the chart,&#34; said the&#10;captain.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;McCoy found a stifling, poisonous atmosphere in the pent cabin.&#10;Stray waftures of invisible gases bit his eyes and made them sting.&#10;The deck was hotter, almost unbearably hot to his bare feet. The&#10;sweat poured out of his body. He looked almost with apprehension&#10;about him. This malignant, internal heat was astounding. It was a&#10;marvel that the cabin did not burst into flames. He had a feeling&#10;as if of being in a huge bake oven where the heat might at any&#10;moment increase tremendously and shrivel him up like a blade of&#10;grass.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As he lifted one foot and rubbed the hot sole against the leg of&#10;his trousers, the mate laughed in a savage, snarling fashion.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The anteroom of hell,&#34; he said. &#34;Hell herself is right down&#10;there under your feet.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It&#39;s hot!&#34; McCoy cried involuntarily, mopping his face with a&#10;bandana handkerchief.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Here&#39;s Mangareva,&#34; the captain said, bending over the table and&#10;pointing to a black speck in the midst of the white blankness of&#10;the chart. &#34;And here, in between, is another island. Why not run&#10;for that?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;McCoy did not look at the chart.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That&#39;s Crescent Island,&#34; he answered. &#34;It is uninhabited, and&#10;it is only two or three feet above water. Lagoon, but no entrance.&#10;No, Mangareva is the nearest place for your purpose.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Mangareva it is, then,&#34; said Captain Davenport, interrupting&#10;the mate&#39;s growling objection. &#34;Call the crew aft, Mr. Konig.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The sailors obeyed, shuffling wearily along the deck and&#10;painfully endeavoring to make haste. Exhaustion was evident in&#10;every movement. The cook came out of his galley to hear, and the&#10;cabin boy hung about near him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When Captain Davenport had explained the situation and announced&#10;his intention of running for Mangareva, an uproar broke out.&#10;Against a background of throaty rumbling arose inarticulate cries&#10;of rage, with here and there a distinct curse, or word, or phrase.&#10;A shrill Cockney voice soared and dominated for a moment, crying:&#10;&#34;Gawd! After bein&#39; in ell for fifteen days&#8212;an&#39; now e wants us to&#10;sail this floatin&#39; ell to sea again?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The captain could not control them, but McCoy&#39;s gentle presence&#10;seemed to rebuke and calm them, and the muttering and cursing died&#10;away, until the full crew, save here and there an anxious face&#10;directed at the captain, yearned dumbly toward the green clad peaks&#10;and beetling coast of Pitcairn.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Soft as a spring zephyr was the voice of McCoy:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Captain, I thought I heard some of them say they were&#10;starving.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ay,&#34; was the answer, &#34;and so we are. I&#39;ve had a sea biscuit and&#10;a spoonful of salmon in the last two days. We&#39;re on whack. You see,&#10;when we discovered the fire, we battened down immediately to&#10;suffocate the fire. And then we found how little food there was in&#10;the pantry. But it was too late. We didn&#39;t dare break out the&#10;lazarette. Hungry? I&#39;m just as hungry as they are.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He spoke to the men again, and again the throat rumbling and&#10;cursing arose, their faces convulsed and animal-like with rage. The&#10;second and third mates had joined the captain, standing behind him&#10;at the break of the poop. Their faces were set and expressionless;&#10;they seemed bored, more than anything else, by this mutiny of the&#10;crew. Captain Davenport glanced questioningly at his first mate,&#10;and that person merely shrugged his shoulders in token of his&#10;helplessness.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You see,&#34; the captain said to McCoy, &#34;you can&#39;t compel sailors&#10;to leave the safe land and go to sea on a burning vessel. She has&#10;been their floating coffin for over two weeks now. They are worked&#10;out, and starved out, and they&#39;ve got enough of her. We&#39;ll beat up&#10;for Pitcairn.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But the wind was light, the Pyrenees&#39; bottom was foul, and she&#10;could not beat up against the strong westerly current. At the end&#10;of two hours she had lost three miles. The sailors worked eagerly,&#10;as if by main strength they could compel the PYRENEES against the&#10;adverse elements. But steadily, port tack and starboard tack, she&#10;sagged off to the westward. The captain paced restlessly up and&#10;down, pausing occasionally to survey the vagrant smoke wisps and to&#10;trace them back to the portions of the deck from which they sprang.&#10;The carpenter was engaged constantly in attempting to locate such&#10;places, and, when he succeeded, in calking them tighter and&#10;tighter.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well, what do you think?&#34; the captain finally asked McCoy, who&#10;was watching the carpenter with all a child&#39;s interest and&#10;curiosity in his eyes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;McCoy looked shoreward, where the land was disappearing in the&#10;thickening haze.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I think it would be better to square away for Mangareva. With&#10;that breeze that is coming, you&#39;ll be there tomorrow evening.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But what if the fire breaks out? It is liable to do it any&#10;moment.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Have your boats ready in the falls. The same breeze will carry&#10;your boats to Mangareva if the ship burns out from under.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Captain Davenport debated for a moment, and then McCoy heard the&#10;question he had not wanted to hear, but which he knew was surely&#10;coming.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I have no chart of Mangareva. On the general chart it is only a&#10;fly speck. I would not know where to look for the entrance into the&#10;lagoon. Will you come along and pilot her in for me?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;McCoy&#39;s serenity was unbroken.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, Captain,&#34; he said, with the same quiet unconcern with&#10;which he would have accepted an invitation to dinner; &#34;I&#39;ll go with&#10;you to Mangareva.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Again the crew was called aft, and the captain spoke to them&#10;from the break of the poop.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;We&#39;ve tried to work her up, but you see how we&#39;ve lost ground.&#10;She&#39;s setting off in a two-knot current. This gentleman is the&#10;Honorable McCoy, Chief Magistrate and Governor of Pitcairn Island.&#10;He will come along with us to Mangareva. So you see the situation&#10;is not so dangerous. He would not make such an offer if he thought&#10;he was going to lose his life. Besides, whatever risk there is, if&#10;he of his own free will come on board and take it, we can do no&#10;less. What do you say for Mangareva?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;This time there was no uproar. &#39;mcCoy&#39;s presence, the surety and&#10;calm that seemed to radiate from him, had had its effect. They&#10;conferred with one another in low voices. There was little urging.&#10;They were virtually unanimous, and they shoved the Cockney out as&#10;their spokesman. That worthy was overwhelmed with consciousness of&#10;the heroism of himself and his mates, and with flashing eyes he&#10;cried:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;By Gawd! If &#39;e will, we will!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The crew mumbled its assent and started forward.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;One moment, Captain,&#34; McCoy said, as the other was turning to&#10;give orders to the mate. &#34;I must go ashore first.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Konig was thunderstruck, staring at McCoy as if he were a&#10;madman.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Go ashore!&#34; the captain cried. &#34;What for? It will take you&#10;three hours to get there in your canoe.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;McCoy measured the distance of the land away, and nodded.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, it is six now. I won&#39;t get ashore till nine. The people&#10;cannot be assembled earlier than ten. As the breeze freshens up&#10;tonight, you can begin to work up against it, and pick me up at&#10;daylight tomorrow morning.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;In the name of reason and common sense,&#34; the captain burst&#10;forth, &#34;what do you want to assemble the people for? Don&#39;t you&#10;realize that my ship is burning beneath me?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;McCoy was as placid as a summer sea, and the other&#39;s anger&#10;produced not the slightest ripple upon it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, Captain,&#34; he cooed in his dove-like voice. &#34;I do realize&#10;that your ship is burning. That is why I am going with you to&#10;Mangareva. But I must get permission to go with you. It is our&#10;custom. It is an important matter when the governor leaves the&#10;island. The people&#39;s interests are at stake, and so they have the&#10;right to vote their permission or refusal. But they will give it, I&#10;know that.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Are you sure?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Quite sure.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Then if you know they will give it, why bother with getting it?&#10;Think of the delay&#8212;a whole night.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It is our custom,&#34; was the imperturbable reply. &#34;Also, I am the&#10;governor, and I must make arrangements for the conduct of the&#10;island during my absence.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But it is only a twenty-four hour run to Mangareva,&#34; the&#10;captain objected. &#34;Suppose it took you six times that long to&#10;return to windward; that would bring you back by the end of a&#10;week.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;McCoy smiled his large, benevolent smile.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Very few vessels come to Pitcairn, and when they do, they are&#10;usually from San Francisco or from around the Horn. I shall be&#10;fortunate if I get back in six months. I may be away a year, and I&#10;may have to go to San Francisco in order to find a vessel that will&#10;bring me back. &#39;my father once left Pitcairn to be gone three&#10;months, and two years passed before he could get back. Then, too,&#10;you are short of food. If you have to take to the boats, and the&#10;weather comes up bad, you may be days in reaching land. I can bring&#10;off two canoe loads of food in the morning. Dried bananas will be&#10;best. As the breeze freshens, you beat up against it. The nearer&#10;you are, the bigger loads I can bring off. Goodby.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He held out his hand. The captain shook it, and was reluctant to&#10;let go. He seemed to cling to it as a drowning sailor clings to a&#10;life buoy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;How do I know you will come back in the morning?&#34; he asked.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, that&#39;s it!&#34; cried the mate. &#34;How do we know but what he&#39;s&#10;skinning out to save his own hide?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;McCoy did not speak. He looked at them sweetly and benignantly,&#10;and it seemed to them that they received a message from his&#10;tremendous certitude of soul.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The captain released his hand, and, with a last sweeping glance&#10;that embraced the crew in its benediction, McCoy went over the rail&#10;and descended into his canoe.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The wind freshened, and the Pyrenees, despite the foulness of&#10;her bottom, won half a dozen miles away from the westerly current.&#10;At daylight, with Pitcairn three miles to windward, Captain&#10;Davenport made out two canoes coming off to him. Again McCoy&#10;clambered up the side and dropped over the rail to the hot deck. He&#10;was followed by many packages of dried bananas, each package&#10;wrapped in dry leaves.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Now, Captain,&#34; he said, &#34;swing the yards and drive for dear&#10;life. You see, I am no navigator,&#34; he explained a few minutes&#10;later, as he stood by the captain aft, the latter with gaze&#10;wandering from aloft to overside as he estimated the Pyrenees&#39;&#10;speed. &#34;You must fetch her to Mangareva. When you have picked up&#10;the land, then I will pilot her in. What do you think she is&#10;making?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Eleven,&#34; Captain Davenport answered, with a final glance at the&#10;water rushing past.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Eleven. Let me see, if she keeps up that gait, we&#39;ll sight&#10;Mangareva between eight and nine o&#39;clock tomorrow morning. I&#39;ll&#10;have her on the beach by ten or by eleven at latest. And then your&#10;troubles will be all over.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It almost seemed to the captain that the blissful moment had&#10;already arrived, such was the persuasive convincingness of&#10;McCoy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Captain Davenport had been under the fearful strain of&#10;navigating his burning ship for over two weeks, and he was&#10;beginning to feel that he had had enough.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A heavier flaw of wind struck the back of his neck and whistled&#10;by his ears. He measured the weight of it, and looked quickly&#10;overside.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The wind is making all the time,&#34; he announced. &#34;The old girl&#39;s&#10;doing nearer twelve than eleven right now. If this keeps up, we&#39;ll&#10;be shortening down tonight.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;All day the Pyrenees, carrying her load of living fire, tore&#10;across the foaming sea. By nightfall, royals and topgallantsails&#10;were in, and she flew on into the darkness, with great, crested&#10;seas roaring after her. The auspicious wind had had its effect, and&#10;fore and aft a visible brightening was apparent. In the second&#10;dog-watch some careless soul started a song, and by eight bells the&#10;whole crew was singing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Captain Davenport had his blankets brought up and spread on top&#10;the house.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I&#39;ve forgotten what sleep is,&#34; he explained to McCoy. &#34;I&#39;m all&#10;in. But give me a call at any time you think necessary.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At three in the morning he was aroused by a gentle tugging at&#10;his arm. He sat up quickly, bracing himself against the skylight,&#10;stupid yet from his heavy sleep. The wind was thrumming its war&#10;song in the rigging, and a wild sea was buffeting the PYRENEES.&#10;Amidships she was wallowing first one rail under and then the&#10;other, flooding the waist more often than not. &#39;mcCoy was shouting&#10;something he could not hear. He reached out, clutched the other by&#10;the shoulder, and drew him close so that his own ear was close to&#10;the other&#39;s lips.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It&#39;s three o&#39;clock,&#34; came McCoy&#39;s voice, still retaining its&#10;dovelike quality, but curiously muffled, as if from a long way off.&#10;&#34;We&#39;ve run two hundred and fifty. Crescent Island is only thirty&#10;miles away, somewhere there dead ahead. There&#39;s no lights on it. If&#10;we keep running, we&#39;ll pile up, and lose ourselves as well as the&#10;ship.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What d&#39; ye think&#8212;heave to?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes; heave to till daylight. It will only put us back four&#10;hours.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So the Pyrenees, with her cargo of fire, was hove to, bitting&#10;the teeth of the gale and fighting and smashing the pounding seas.&#10;She was a shell, filled with a conflagration, and on the outside of&#10;the shell, clinging precariously, the little motes of men, by pull&#10;and haul, helped her in the battle.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It is most unusual, this gale,&#34; McCoy told the captain, in the&#10;lee of the cabin. &#34;By rights there should be no gale at this time&#10;of the year. But everything about the weather has been unusual.&#10;There has been a stoppage of the trades, and now it&#39;s howling right&#10;out of the trade quarter.&#34; He waved his hand into the darkness, as&#10;if his vision could dimly penetrate for hundreds of miles. &#34;It is&#10;off to the westward. There is something big making off there&#10;somewhere&#8212;a hurricane or something. We&#39;re lucky to be so far to the&#10;eastward. But this is only a little blow,&#34; he added. &#34;It can&#39;t&#10;last. I can tell you that much.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;By daylight the gale had eased down to normal. But daylight&#10;revealed a new danger. It had come on thick. The sea was covered by&#10;a fog, or, rather, by a pearly mist that was fog-like in density,&#10;in so far as it obstructed vision, but that was no more than a film&#10;on the sea, for the sun shot it through and filled it with a&#10;glowing radiance.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The deck of the Pyrenees was making more smoke than on the&#10;preceding day, and the cheerfulness of officers and crew had&#10;vanished. In the lee of the galley the cabin boy could be heard&#10;whimpering. It was his first voyage, and the fear of death was at&#10;his heart. The captain wandered about like a lost soul, nervously&#10;chewing his mustache, scowling, unable to make up his mind what to&#10;do.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What do you think?&#34; he asked, pausing by the side of McCoy, who&#10;was making a breakfast off fried bananas and a mug of water.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;McCoy finished the last banana, drained the mug, and looked&#10;slowly around. In his eyes was a smile of tenderness as he&#10;said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well, Captain, we might as well drive as burn. Your decks are&#10;not going to hold out forever. They are hotter this morning. You&#10;haven&#39;t a pair of shoes I can wear? It is getting uncomfortable for&#10;my bare feet.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Pyrenees shipped two heavy seas as she was swung off and put&#10;once more before it, and the first mate expressed a desire to have&#10;all that water down in the hold, if only it could be introduced&#10;without taking off the hatches. &#39;mcCoy ducked his head into the&#10;binnacle and watched the course set.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I&#39;d hold her up some more, Captain,&#34; he said. &#34;She&#39;s been&#10;making drift when hove to.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I&#39;ve set it to a point higher already,&#34; was the answer. &#34;Isn&#39;t&#10;that enough?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I&#39;d make it two points, Captain. This bit of a blow kicked that&#10;westerly current ahead faster than you imagine.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Captain Davenport compromised on a point and a half, and then&#10;went aloft, accompanied by McCoy and the first mate, to keep a&#10;lookout for land. Sail had been made, so that the Pyrenees was&#10;doing ten knots. The following sea was dying down rapidly. There&#10;was no break in the pearly fog, and by ten o&#39;clock Captain&#10;Davenport was growing nervous. Al l hands were at their stations,&#10;ready, at the first warning of land ahead, to spring like fiends to&#10;the task of bringing the Pyrenees up on the wind. That land ahead,&#10;a surf-washed outer reef, would be perilously close when it&#10;revealed itself in such a fog.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Another hour passed. The three watchers aloft stared intently&#10;into the pearly radiance.&#34;What if we miss Mangareva?&#34; Captain&#10;Davenport asked abruptly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;McCoy, without shifting his gaze, answered softly:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why, let her drive, captain. That is all we can do. All the&#10;Paumotus are before us. We can drive for a thousand miles through&#10;reefs and atolls. We are bound to fetch up somewhere.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Then drive it is.&#34; Captain Davenport evidenced his intention of&#10;descending to the deck. &#34;We&#39;ve missed Mangareva. God knows where&#10;the next land is. I wish I&#39;d held her up that other half-point,&#34; he&#10;confessed a moment later. &#34;This cursed current plays the devil with&#10;a navigator.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The old navigators called the Paumotus the Dangerous&#10;Archipelago,&#34; McCoy said, when they had regained the poop. &#34;This&#10;very current was partly responsible for that name.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I was talking with a sailor chap in Sydney, once,&#34; said Mr.&#10;Konig. &#34;He&#39;d been trading in the Paumotus. He told me insurance was&#10;eighteen per cent. Is that right?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;McCoy smiled and nodded.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Except that they don&#39;t insure,&#34; he explained. &#34;The owners write&#10;off twenty per cent of the cost of their schooners each year.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My God!&#34; Captain Davenport groaned. &#34;That makes the life of a&#10;schooner only five years!&#34; He shook his head sadly, murmuring, &#34;Bad&#10;waters! Bad waters!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Again they went into the cabin to consult the big general chart;&#10;but the poisonous vapors drove them coughing and gasping on&#10;deck.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Here is Moerenhout Island,&#34; Captain Davenport pointed it out on&#10;the chart, which he had spread on the house. &#34;It can&#39;t be more than&#10;a hundred miles to leeward.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;A hundred and ten.&#34; &#39;mcCoy shook his head doubtfully. &#34;It might&#10;be done, but it is very difficult. I might beach her, and then&#10;again I might put her on the reef. A bad place, a very bad&#10;place.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;We&#39;ll take the chance,&#34; was Captain Davenport&#39;s decision, as he&#10;set about working out the course.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Sail was shortened early in the afternoon, to avoid running past&#10;in the night; and in the second dog-watch the crew manifested its&#10;regained cheerfulness. Land was so very near, and their troubles&#10;would be over in the morning.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But morning broke clear, with a blazing tropic sun. The&#10;southeast trade had swung around to the eastward, and was driving&#10;the PYRENEES through the water at an eight-knot clip. Captain&#10;Davenport worked up his dead reckoning, allowing generously for&#10;drift, and announced Moerenhout Island to be not more than ten&#10;miles off. The Pyrenees sailed the ten miles; she sailed ten miles&#10;more; and the lookouts at the three mastheads saw naught but the&#10;naked, sun-washed sea.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But the land is there, I tell you,&#34; Captain Davenport shouted&#10;to them from the poop.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;McCoy smiled soothingly, but the captain glared about him like a&#10;madman, fetched his sextant, and took a chronometer sight.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I knew I was right, he almost shouted, when he had worked up&#10;the observation. &#34;Twenty-one, fifty-five, south; one-thirty-six,&#10;two, west. There you are. We&#39;re eight miles to windward yet. What&#10;did you make it out, Mr. Konig?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The first mate glanced at his own figures, and said in a low&#10;voice:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Twenty-one, fifty-five all right; but my longitude&#39;s&#10;one-thirty-six, forty-eight. That puts us considerably to&#10;leeward&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But Captain Davenport ignored his figures with so contemptuous a&#10;silence as to make Mr. Konig grit his teeth and curse savagely&#10;under his breath.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Keep her off,&#34; the captain ordered the man at the wheel. &#34;Three&#10;points&#8212;steady there, as she goes!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then he returned to his figures and worked them over. The sweat&#10;poured from his face. He chewed his mustache, his lips, and his&#10;pencil, staring at the figures as a man might at a ghost. Suddenly,&#10;with a fierce, muscular outburst, he crumpled the scribbled paper&#10;in his fist and crushed it under foot. &#39;mr. Konig grinned&#10;vindictively and turned away, while Captain Davenport leaned&#10;against the cabin and for half an hour spoke no word, contenting&#10;himself with gazing to leeward with an expression of musing&#10;hopelessness on his face.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Mr. McCoy,&#34; he broke silence abruptly. &#34;The chart indicates a&#10;group of islands, but not how many, off there to the north&#39;ard, or&#10;nor&#39;-nor&#39;westward, about forty miles&#8212;the Acteon Islands. What about&#10;them?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;There are four, all low,&#34; McCoy answered. &#34;First to the&#10;southeast is Matuerui&#8212;no people, no entrance to the lagoon. Then&#10;comes Tenarunga. There used to be about a dozen people there, but&#10;they may be all gone now. Anyway, there is no entrance for a&#10;ship&#8212;only a boat entrance, with a fathom of water. Vehauga and&#10;Teua-raro are the other two. No entrances, no people, very low.&#10;There is no bed for the Pyrenees in that group. She would be a&#10;total wreck.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Listen to that!&#34; Captain Davenport was frantic. &#34;No people! No&#10;entrances! What in the devil are islands good for?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well, then, he barked suddenly, like an excited terrier, &#34;the&#10;chart gives a whole mess of islands off to the nor&#39;west. What about&#10;them? What one has an entrance where I can lay my ship?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;McCoy calmly considered. He did not refer to the chart. All&#10;these islands, reefs, shoals, lagoons, entrances, and distances&#10;were marked on the chart of his memory. He knew them as the city&#10;dweller knows his buildings, streets, and alleys.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Papakena and Vanavana are off there to the westward, or&#10;west-nor&#39;westward a hundred miles and a bit more,&#34; he said. &#34;One is&#10;uninhabited, and I heard that the people on the other had gone off&#10;to Cadmus Island. Anyway, neither lagoon has an entrance. Ahunui is&#10;another hundred miles on to the nor&#39;west. No entrance, no&#10;people.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well, forty miles beyond them are two islands?&#34; Captain&#10;Davenport queried, raising his head from the chart.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;McCoy shook his head.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Paros and Manuhungi&#8212;no entrances, no people. Nengo-Nengo is&#10;forty miles beyond them, in turn, and it has no people and no&#10;entrance. But there is Hao Island. It is just the place. The lagoon&#10;is thirty miles long and five miles wide. There are plenty of&#10;people. You can usually find water. And any ship in the world can&#10;go through the entrance.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He ceased and gazed solicitously at Captain Davenport, who,&#10;bending over the chart with a pair of dividers in hand, had just&#10;emitted a low groan.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Is there any lagoon with an entrance anywhere nearer than Hao&#10;Island?&#34; he asked.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No, Captain; that is the nearest.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well, it&#39;s three hundred and forty miles.&#34; Captain Davenport&#10;was speaking very slowly, with decision. &#34;I won&#39;t risk the&#10;responsibility of all these lives. I&#39;ll wreck her on the Acteons.&#10;And she&#39;s a good ship, too,&#34; he added regretfully, after altering&#10;the course, this time making more allowance than ever for the&#10;westerly current.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;An hour later the sky was overcast. The southeast trade still&#10;held, but the ocean was a checker board of squalls.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;We&#39;ll be there by one o&#39;clock,&#34; Captain Davenport announced&#10;confidently. &#34;By two o&#39;clock at the outside. &#39;mcCoy, you put her&#10;ashore on the one where the people are.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The sun did not appear again, nor, at one o&#39;clock, was any land&#10;to be seen. Captain Davenport looked astern at the Pyrenees&#39;&#10;canting wake.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Good Lord!&#34; he cried. &#34;An easterly current? Look at that!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Konig was incredulous. &#39;mcCoy was noncommittal, though he&#10;said that in the Paumotus there was no reason why it should not be&#10;an easterly current. A few minutes later a squall robbed the&#10;Pyrenees temporarily of all her wind, and she was left rolling&#10;heavily in the trough.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Where&#39;s that deep lead? Over with it, you there!&#34; Captain&#10;Davenport held the lead line and watched it sag off to the&#10;northeast. &#34;There, look at that! Take hold of it for yourself.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;McCoy and the mate tried it, and felt the line thrumming and&#10;vibrating savagely to the grip of the tidal stream.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;A four-knot current,&#34; said Mr. Konig.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;An easterly current instead of a westerly,&#34; said Captain&#10;&#34;Davenport, glaring accusingly at McCoy, as if to cast the blame&#10;for it upon him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That is one of the reasons, Captain, for insurance being&#10;eighteen per cent in these waters,&#34; McCoy answered cheerfully. &#34;You&#10;can never tell. The currents are always changing. There was a man&#10;who wrote books, I forget his name, in the yacht Casco.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He missed Takaroa by thirty miles and fetched Tikei, all because&#10;of the shifting currents. You are up to windward now, and you&#39;d&#10;better keep off a few points.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But how much has this current set me?&#34; the captain demanded&#10;irately. &#34;How am I to know how much to keep off?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I don&#39;t know, Captain,&#34; McCoy said with great gentleness.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The wind returned, and the PYRENEES, her deck smoking and&#10;shimmering in the bright gray light, ran off dead to leeward. Then&#10;she worked back, port tack and starboard tack, crisscrossing her&#10;track, combing the sea for the Acteon Islands, which the masthead&#10;lookouts failed to sight.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Captain Davenport was beside himself. His rage took the form of&#10;sullen silence, and he spent the afternoon in pacing the poop or&#10;leaning against the weather shrouds. At nightfall, without even&#10;consulting McCoy, he squared away and headed into the northwest.&#10;Mr. Konig, surreptitiously consulting chart and binnacle, and&#10;McCoy, openly and innocently consulting the binnacle, knew that&#10;they were running for Hao Island. By midnight the squalls ceased,&#10;and the stars came out. Captain Davenport was cheered by the&#10;promise of a clear day.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I&#39;ll get an observation in the morning,&#34; he told McCoy, &#34;though&#10;what my latitude is, is a puzzler. But I&#39;ll use the Sumner method,&#10;and settle that. Do you know the Sumner line?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And thereupon he explained it in detail to McCoy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The day proved clear, the trade blew steadily out of the east,&#10;and the Pyrenees just as steadily logged her nine knots. Both the&#10;captain and mate worked out the position on a Sumner line, and&#10;agreed, and at noon agreed again, and verified the morning sights&#10;by the noon sights.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Another twenty-four hours and we&#39;ll be there,&#34; Captain&#10;Davenport assured McCoy. :&#34;It&#39;s a miracle the way the old girl&#39;s&#10;decks hold out. But they can&#39;t last. They can&#39;t last. Look at them&#10;smoke, more and more every day. Yet it was a tight deck to begin&#10;with, fresh-calked in Frisco. I was surprised when the fire first&#10;broke out and we battened down. Look at that!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He broke off to gaze with dropped jaw at a spiral of smoke that&#10;coiled and twisted in the lee of the mizzenmast twenty feet above&#10;the deck.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Now, how did that get there?&#34; he demanded indignantly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Beneath it there was no smoke. Crawling up from the deck,&#10;sheltered from the wind by the mast, by some freak it took form and&#10;visibility at that height. It writhed away from the mast, and for a&#10;moment overhung the captain like some threatening portent. The next&#10;moment the wind whisked it away, and the captain&#39;s jaw returned to&#10;place.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;As I was saying, when we first battened down, I was surprised.&#10;It was a tight deck, yet it leaked smoke like a sieve. And we&#39;ve&#10;calked and calked ever since. There must be tremendous pressure&#10;underneath to drive so much smoke through.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;That afternoon the sky became overcast again, and squally,&#10;drizzly weather set in. The wind shifted back and forth between&#10;southeast and northeast, and at midnight the Pyrenees was caught&#10;aback by a sharp squall from the southwest, from which point the&#10;wind continued to blow intermittently.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;We won&#39;t make Hao until ten or eleven,&#34; Captain Davenport&#10;complained at seven in the morning, when the fleeting promise of&#10;the sun had been erased by hazy cloud masses in the eastern sky.&#10;And the next moment he was plaintively demanding, &#34;And what are the&#10;currents doing?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Lookouts at the mastheads could report no land, and the day&#10;passed in drizzling calms and violent squalls. By nightfall a heavy&#10;sea began to make from the west. The barometer had fallen to 29.50.&#10;There was no wind, and still the ominous sea continued to increase.&#10;Soon the Pyrenees was rolling madly in the huge waves that marched&#10;in an unending procession from out of the darkness of the west.&#10;Sail was shortened as fast as both watches could work, and, when&#10;the tired crew had finished, its grumbling and complaining voices,&#10;peculiarly animal-like and menacing, could be heard in the&#10;darkness. Once the starboard watch was called aft to lash down and&#10;make secure, and the men openly advertised their sullenness and&#10;unwillingness. Every slow movement was a protest and a threat. The&#10;atmosphere was moist and sticky like mucilage, and in the absence&#10;of wind all hands seemed to pant and gasp for air. The sweat stood&#10;out on faces and bare arms, and Captain Davenport for one, his face&#10;more gaunt and care-worn than ever, and his eyes troubled and&#10;staring, was oppressed by a feeling of impending calamity.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It&#39;s off to the westward,&#34; McCoy said encouragingly. &#34;At worst,&#10;we&#39;ll be only on the edge of it.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But Captain Davenport refused to be comforted, and by the light&#10;of a lantern read up the chapter in his Epitome that related to the&#10;strategy of shipmasters in cyclonic storms. From somewhere&#10;amidships the silence was broken by a low whimpering from the cabin&#10;boy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh, shut up!&#34; Captain Davenport yelled suddenly and with such&#10;force as to startle every man on board and to frighten the offender&#10;into a wild wail of terror.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Mr. Konig,&#34; the captain said in a voice that trembled with rage&#10;and nerves, &#34;will you kindly step for&#39;ard and stop that brat&#39;s&#10;mouth with a deck mop?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But it was McCoy who went forward, and in a few minutes had the&#10;boy comforted and asleep.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Shortly before daybreak the first breath of air began to move&#10;from out the southeast, increasing swiftly to a stiff and stiffer&#10;breeze. All hands were on deck waiting for what might be behind it.&#10;&#34;We&#39;re all right now, Captain,&#34; said McCoy, standing close to his&#10;shoulder. &#34;The hurricane is to the west&#39;ard, and we are south of&#10;it. This breeze is the in-suck. It won&#39;t blow any harder. You can&#10;begin to put sail on her.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But what&#39;s the good? Where shall I sail? This is the second day&#10;without observations, and we should have sighted Hao Island&#10;yesterday morning. Which way does it bear, north, south, east, or&#10;what? Tell me that, and I&#39;ll make sail in a jiffy.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I am no navigator, Captain,&#34; McCoy said in his mild way.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I used to think I was one,&#34; was the retort, &#34;before I got into&#10;these Paumotus.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At midday the cry of &#34;Breakers ahead!&#34; was heard from the&#10;lookout. The Pyrenees was kept off, and sail after sail was loosed&#10;and sheeted home. The Pyrenees was sliding through the water and&#10;fighting a current that threatened to set her down upon the&#10;breakers. Officers and men were working like mad, cook and cabin&#10;boy, Captain Davenport himself, and McCoy all lending a hand. It&#10;was a close shave. It was a low shoal, a bleak and perilous place&#10;over which the seas broke unceasingly, where no man could live, and&#10;on which not even sea birds could rest. The PYRENEES was swept&#10;within a hundred yards of it before the wind carried her clear, and&#10;at this moment the panting crew, its work done, burst out in a&#10;torrent of curses upon the head of McCoy &#8212;of McCoy who had come on&#10;board, and proposed the run to Mangareva, and lured them all away&#10;from the safety of Pitcairn Island to certain destruction in this&#10;baffling and terrible stretch of sea. But McCoy&#39;s tranquil soul was&#10;undisturbed. He smiled at them with simple and gracious&#10;benevolence, and, somehow, the exalted goodness of him seemed to&#10;penetrate to their dark and somber souls, shaming them, and from&#10;very shame stilling the curses vibrating in their throats.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Bad waters! Bad waters!&#34; Captain Davenport was murmuring as his&#10;ship forged clear; but he broke off abruptly to gaze at the shoal&#10;which should have been dead astern, but which was already on the&#10;PYRENEES&#39; weather-quarter and working up rapidly to windward.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He sat down and buried his face in his hands. And the first mate&#10;saw, and McCoy saw, and the crew saw, what he had seen. South of&#10;the shoal an easterly current had set them down upon it; north of&#10;the shoal an equally swift westerly current had clutched the ship&#10;and was sweeping her away.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I&#39;ve heard of these Paumotus before,&#34; the captain groaned,&#10;lifting his blanched face from his hands. &#34;Captain Moyendale told&#10;me about them after losing his ship on them. And I laughed at him&#10;behind his back. God forgive me, I laughed at him. What shoal is&#10;that?&#34; he broke off, to ask McCoy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I don&#39;t know, Captain.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why don&#39;t you know?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Because I never saw it before, and because I have never heard&#10;of it. I do know that it is not charted. These waters have never&#10;been thoroughly surveyed.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Then you don&#39;t know where we are?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No more than you do,&#34; McCoy said gently.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At four in the afternoon cocoanut trees were sighted, apparently&#10;growing out of the water. A little later the low land of an atoll&#10;was raised above the sea.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I know where we are now, Captain.&#34; McCoy lowered the glasses&#10;from his eyes. &#34;That&#39;s Resolution Island. We are forty miles beyond&#10;Hao Island, and the wind is in our teeth.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Get ready to beach her then. Where&#39;s the entrance?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;There&#39;s only a canoe passage. But now that we know where we&#10;are, we can run for Barclay de Tolley. It is only one hundred and&#10;twenty miles from here, due nor&#39;-nor&#39;west. With this breeze we can&#10;be there by nine o&#39;clock tomorrow morning.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Captain Davenport consulted the chart and debated with&#10;himself.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;If we wreck her here,&#34; McCoy added, &#34;we&#39;d have to make the run&#10;to Barclay de Tolley in the boats just the same.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The captain gave his orders, and once more the Pyrenees swung&#10;off for another run across the inhospitable sea.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And the middle of the next afternoon saw despair and mutiny on&#10;her smoking deck. The current had accelerated, the wind had&#10;slackened, and the Pyrenees had sagged off to the west. The lookout&#10;sighted Barclay de Tolley to the eastward, barely visible from the&#10;masthead, and vainly and for hours the PYRENEES tried to beat up to&#10;it. Ever, like a mirage, the cocoanut trees hovered on the horizon,&#10;visible only from the masthead. From the deck they were hidden by&#10;the bulge of the world.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Again Captain Davenport consulted McCoy and the chart. &#39;makemo&#10;lay seventy-five miles to the southwest. Its lagoon was thirty&#10;miles long, and its entrance was excellent. When Captain Davenport&#10;gave his orders, the crew refused duty. They announced that they&#10;had had enough of hell fire under their feet. There was the land.&#10;What if the ship could not make it? They could make it in the&#10;boats. Let her burn, then. Their lives amounted to something to&#10;them. They had served faithfully the ship, now they were going to&#10;serve themselves.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;They sprang to the boats, brushing the second and third mates&#10;out of the way, and proceeded to swing the boats out and to prepare&#10;to lower away. Captain Davenport and the first mate, revolvers in&#10;hand, were advancing to the break of the poop, when McCoy, who had&#10;climbed on top of the cabin, began to speak.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He spoke to the sailors, and at the first sound of his dovelike,&#10;cooing voice they paused to hear. He extended to them his own&#10;ineffable serenity and peace. His soft voice and simple thoughts&#10;flowed out to them in a magic stream, soothing them against their&#10;wills. Long forgotten things came back to them, and some remembered&#10;lullaby songs of childhood and the content and rest of the mother&#39;s&#10;arm at the end of the day. There was no more trouble, no more&#10;danger, no more irk, in all the world. Everything was as it should&#10;be, and it was only a matter of course that they should turn their&#10;backs upon the land and put to sea once more with hell fire hot&#10;beneath their feet.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;McCoy spoke simply; but it was not what he spoke. It was his&#10;personality that spoke more eloquently than any word he could&#10;utter. It was an alchemy of soul occultly subtile and profoundly&#10;deep&#8212;a mysterious emanation of the spirit, seductive, sweetly&#10;humble, and terribly imperious. It was illumination in the dark&#10;crypts of their souls, a compulsion of purity and gentleness vastly&#10;greater than that which resided in the shining, death-spitting&#10;revolvers of the officers.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The men wavered reluctantly where they stood, and those who had&#10;loosed the turns made them fast again. Then one, and then another,&#10;and then all of them, began to sidle awkwardly away.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;McCoy&#39;s face was beaming with childlike pleasure as he descended&#10;from the top of the cabin. Thee was no trouble. For that matter&#10;there had been no trouble averted. There never had been any&#10;trouble, for there was no place for such in the blissful world in&#10;which he lived.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You hypnotized em,&#34; Mr. Konig grinned at him, speaking in a low&#10;voice.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Those boys are good,&#34; was the answer. &#34;Their hearts are good.&#10;They have had a hard time, and they have worked hard, and they will&#10;work hard to the end.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Konig had not time to reply. His voice was ringing out&#10;orders, the sailors were springing to obey, and the PYRENEES was&#10;paying slowly off from the wind until her bow should point in the&#10;direction of Makemo.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The wind was very light, and after sundown almost ceased. It was&#10;insufferably warm, and fore and aft men sought vainly to sleep. The&#10;deck was too hot to lie upon, and poisonous vapors, oozing through&#10;the seams, crept like evil spirits over the ship, stealing into the&#10;nostrils and windpipes of the unwary and causing fits of sneezing&#10;and coughing. The stars blinked lazily in the dim vault overhead;&#10;and the full moon, rising in the east, touched with its light the&#10;myriads of wisps and threads and spidery films of smoke that&#10;intertwined and writhed and twisted along the deck, over the rails,&#10;and up the masts and shrouds.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Tell me,&#34; Captain Davenport said, rubbing his smarting eyes,&#10;&#34;what happened with that BOUNTY crowd after they reached Pitcairn?&#10;The account I read said they burnt the Bounty, and that they were&#10;not discovered until many years later. But what happened in the&#10;meantime? I&#39;ve always been curious to know. They were men with&#10;their necks in the rope. There were some native men, too. And then&#10;there were women. That made it look like trouble right from the&#10;jump.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;There was trouble,&#34; McCoy answered. &#34;They were bad men. They&#10;quarreled about the women right away. One of the mutineers,&#10;Williams, lost his wife. All the women were Tahitian women. His&#10;wife fell from the cliffs when hunting sea birds. Then he took the&#10;wife of one of the native men away from him. All the native men&#10;were made very angry by this, and they killed off nearly all the&#10;mutineers. Then the mutineers that escaped killed off all the&#10;native men. The women helped. And the natives killed each other.&#10;Everybody killed everybody. They were terrible men.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Timiti was killed by two other natives while they were combing&#10;his hair in friendship. The white men had sent them to do it. Then&#10;the white men killed them. The wife of Tullaloo killed him in a&#10;cave because she wanted a white man for husband. They were very&#10;wicked. God had hidden His face from them. At the end of two years&#10;all the native men were murdered, and all the white men except&#10;four. They were Young, John Adams, McCoy, who was my&#10;great-grandfather, and Quintal. He was a very bad man, too. Once,&#10;just because his wife did not catch enough fish for him, he bit off&#10;her ear.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;They were a bad lot!&#34; Mr. Konig exclaimed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, they were very bad,&#34; McCoy agreed and went on serenely&#10;cooing of the blood and lust of his iniquitous ancestry. &#34;My&#10;great-grandfather escaped murder in order to die by his own hand.&#10;He made a still and manufactured alcohol from the roots of the&#10;ti-plant. Quintal was his chum, and they got drunk together all the&#10;time. At last McCoy got delirium tremens, tied a rock to his neck,&#10;and jumped into the sea.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Quintal&#39;s wife, the one whose ear he bit off, also got killed&#10;by falling from the cliffs. Then Quintal went to Young and demanded&#10;his wife, and went to Adams and demanded his wife. Adams and Young&#10;were afraid of Quintal. They knew he would kill them. So they&#10;killed him, the two of them together, with a hatchet. Then Young&#10;died. And that was about all the trouble they had.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I should say so,&#34; Captain Davenport snorted. &#34;There was nobody&#10;left to kill.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You see, God had hidden His face,&#34; McCoy said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;By morning no more than a faint air was blowing from the&#10;eastward, and, unable to make appreciable southing by it, Captain&#10;Davenport hauled up full-and-by on the port track. He was afraid of&#10;that terrible westerly current which had cheated him out of so many&#10;ports of refuge. All day the calm continued, and all night, while&#10;the sailors, on a short ration of dried banana, were grumbling.&#10;Also, they were growing weak and complaining of stomach pains&#10;caused by the straight banana diet. All day the current swept the&#10;PYRENEES to the westward, while there was no wind to bear her&#10;south. In the middle of the first dogwatch, cocoanut trees were&#10;sighted due south, their tufted heads rising above the water and&#10;marking the low-lying atoll beneath.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That is Taenga Island,&#34; McCoy said. &#34;We need a breeze tonight,&#10;or else we&#39;ll miss Makemo.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What&#39;s become of the southeast trade?&#34; the captain demanded.&#10;&#34;Why don&#39;t it blow? What&#39;s the matter?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It is the evaporation from the big lagoons&#8212;there are so many of&#10;them,&#34; McCoy explained. The evaporation upsets the whole system of&#10;trades. It even causes the wind to back up and blow gales from the&#10;southwest. This is the Dangerous Archipelago, Captain.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Captain Davenport faced the old man, opened his mouth, and was&#10;about to curse, but paused and refrained. &#39;mcCoy&#39;s presence was a&#10;rebuke to the blasphemies that stirred in his brain and trembled in&#10;his larynx. &#39;mcCoy&#39;s influence had been growing during the many&#10;days they had been together. Captain Davenport was an autocrat of&#10;the sea, fearing no man, never bridling his tongue, and now he&#10;found himself unable to curse in the presence of this old man with&#10;the feminine brown eyes and the voice of a dove. When he realized&#10;this, Captain Davenport experienced a distinct shock. This old man&#10;was merely the seed of McCoy, of McCoy of the BOUNTY, the mutineer&#10;fleeing from the hemp that waited him in England, the McCoy who was&#10;a power for evil in the early days of blood and lust and violent&#10;death on Pitcairn Island.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Captain Davenport was not religious, yet in that moment he felt&#10;a mad impulse to cast himself at the other&#39;s feet&#8212;and to say he&#10;knew not what. It was an emotion that so deeply stirred him, rather&#10;than a coherent thought, and he was aware in some vague way of his&#10;own unworthiness and smallness in the presence of this other man&#10;who possessed the simplicity of a child and the gentleness of a&#10;woman.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Of course he could not so humble himself before the eyes of his&#10;officers and men. And yet the anger that had prompted the blasphemy&#10;still raged in him. He suddenly smote the cabin with his clenched&#10;hand and cried:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Look here, old man, I won&#39;t be beaten. These Paumotus have&#10;cheated and tricked me and made a fool of me. I refuse to be&#10;beaten. I am going to drive this ship, and drive and drive and&#10;drive clear through the Paumotus to China but what I find a bed for&#10;her. If every man deserts, I&#39;ll stay by her. I&#39;ll show the&#10;Paumotus. They can&#39;t fool me. She&#39;s a good girl, and I&#39;ll stick by&#10;her as long as there&#39;s a plank to stand on. You hear me?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And I&#39;ll stay with you, Captain,&#34; McCoy said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;During the night, light, baffling airs blew out of the south,&#10;and the frantic captain, with his cargo of fire, watched and&#10;measured his westward drift and went off by himself at times to&#10;curse softly so that McCoy should not hear.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Daylight showed more palms growing out of the water to the&#10;south.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That&#39;s the leeward point of Makemo,&#34; McCoy said. &#34;Katiu is only&#10;a few miles to the west. We may make that.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But the current, sucking between the two islands, swept them to&#10;the northwest, and at one in the afternoon they saw the palms of&#10;Katiu rise above the sea and sink back into the sea again.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A few minutes later, just as the captain had discovered that a&#10;new current from the northeast had gripped the Pyrenees, the&#10;masthead lookouts raised cocoanut palms in the northwest.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It is Raraka,&#34; said McCoy. &#34;We won&#39;t make it without wind. The&#10;current is drawing us down to the southwest. But we must watch out.&#10;A few miles farther on a current flows north and turns in a circle&#10;to the northwest. This will sweep us away from Fakarava, and&#10;Fakarava is the place for the Pyrenees to find her bed.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;They can sweep all they da&#8212;all they well please,&#34; Captain&#10;Davenport remarked with heat. &#34;We&#39;ll find a bed for her somewhere&#10;just the same.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But the situation on the Pyrenees was reaching a culmination.&#10;The deck was so hot that it seemed an increase of a few degrees&#10;would cause it to burst into flames. In many places even the&#10;heavy-soled shoes of the men were no protection, and they were&#10;compelled to step lively to avoid scorching their feet. The smoke&#10;had increased and grown more acrid. Every man on board was&#10;suffering from inflamed eyes, and they coughed and strangled like a&#10;crew of tuberculosis patients. In the afternoon the boats were&#10;swung out and equipped. The last several packages of dried bananas&#10;were stored in them, as well as the instruments of the officers.&#10;Captain Davenport even put the chronometer into the longboat,&#10;fearing the blowing up of the deck at any moment.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;All night this apprehension weighed heavily on all, and in the&#10;first morning light, with hollow eyes and ghastly faces, they&#10;stared at one another as if in surprise that the Pyrenees still&#10;held together and that they still were alive.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Walking rapidly at times, and even occasionally breaking into an&#10;undignified hop-skip-and-run, Captain Davenport inspected his&#10;ship&#39;s deck.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It is a matter of hours now, if not of minutes,&#34; he announced&#10;on his return to the poop.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The cry of land came down from the masthead. From the deck the&#10;land was invisible, and McCoy went aloft, while the captain took&#10;advantage of the opportunity to curse some of the bitterness out of&#10;his heart. But the cursing was suddenly stopped by a dark line on&#10;the water which he sighted to the northeast. It was not a squall,&#10;but a regular breeze&#8212;the disrupted trade wind, eight points out of&#10;its direction but resuming business once more.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Hold her up, Captain,&#34; McCoy said as soon as he reached the&#10;poop. &#34;That&#39;s the easterly point of Fakarava, and we&#39;ll go in&#10;through the passage full-tilt, the wind abeam, and every sail&#10;drawing.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At the end of an hour, the cocoanut trees and the low-lying land&#10;were visible from the deck. The feeling that the end of the&#10;PYRENEES&#39; resistance was imminent weighed heavily on everybody.&#10;Captain Davenport had the three boats lowered and dropped short&#10;astern, a man in each to keep them apart. The Pyrenees closely&#10;skirted the shore, the surf-whitened atoll a bare two cable lengths&#10;away.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And a minute later the land parted, exposing a narrow passage&#10;and the lagoon beyond, a great mirror, thirty miles in length and a&#10;third as broad.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Now, Captain.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For the last time the yards of the Pyrenees swung around as she&#10;obeyed the wheel and headed into the passage. The turns had&#10;scarcely been made, and nothing had been coiled down, when the men&#10;and mates swept back to the poop in panic terror. Nothing had&#10;happened, yet they averred that something was going to happen. They&#10;could not tell why. They merely knew that it was about to happen.&#10;&#39;mcCoy started forward to take up his position on the bow in order&#10;to con the vessel in; but the captain gripped his arm and whirled&#10;him around.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Do it from here,&#34; he said. &#34;That deck&#39;s not safe. What&#39;s the&#10;matter?&#34; he demanded the next instant. &#34;We&#39;re standing still.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;McCoy smiled.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You are bucking a seven-knot current, Captain,&#34; he said. &#34;That&#10;is the way the full ebb runs out of this passage.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At the end of another hour the Pyrenees had scarcely gained her&#10;length, but the wind freshened and she began to forge ahead.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Better get into the boats, some of you,&#34; Captain Davenport&#10;commanded.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;His voice was still ringing, and the men were just beginning to&#10;move in obedience, when the amidship deck of the Pyrenees, in a&#10;mass of flame and smoke, was flung upward into the sails and&#10;rigging, part of it remaining there and the rest falling into the&#10;sea. The wind being abeam, was what had saved the men crowded aft.&#10;They made a blind rush to gain the boats, but McCoy&#39;s voice,&#10;carrying its convincing message of vast calm and endless time,&#10;stopped them.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Take it easy,&#34; he was saying. Everything is all right. Pass&#10;that boy down somebody, please.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The man at the wheel had forsaken it in a funk, and Captain&#10;Davenport had leaped and caught the spokes in time to prevent the&#10;ship from yawing in the current and going ashore.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Better take charge of the boats,&#34; he said to Mr. Konig. &#34;Tow&#10;one of them short, right under the quarter&#8230; . When I go over, it&#39;ll&#10;be on the jump.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Konig hesitated, then went over the rail and lowered himself&#10;into the boat.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Keep her off half a point, Captain.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Captain Davenport gave a start. He had thought he had the ship&#10;to himself.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ay, ay; half a point it is,&#34; he answered.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Amidships the Pyrenees was an open flaming furnace, out of which&#10;poured an immense volume of smoke which rose high above the masts&#10;and completely hid the forward part of the ship. &#39;mcCoy, in the&#10;shelter of the mizzen-shrouds, continued his difficult task of&#10;conning the ship through the intricate channel. The fire was&#10;working aft along the deck from the seat of explosion, while the&#10;soaring tower of canvas on the mainmast went up and vanished in a&#10;sheet of flame. Forward, though they could not see them, they knew&#10;that the head-sails were still drawing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;If only she don&#39;t burn all her canvas off before she makes&#10;inside,:&#34; the captain groaned.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;She&#39;ll make it,&#34; McCoy assured him with supreme confidence.&#10;&#34;There is plenty of time. She is bound to make it. And once inside,&#10;we&#39;ll put her before it; that will keep the smoke away from us and&#10;hold back the fire from working aft.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A tongue of flame sprang up the mizzen, reached hungrily for the&#10;lowest tier of canvas, missed it, and vanished. From aloft a&#10;burning shred of rope stuff fell square on the back of Captain&#10;Davenport&#39;s neck. He acted with the celerity of one stung by a bee&#10;as he reached up and brushed the offending fire from his skin.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;How is she heading, Captain?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Nor&#39;west by west.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Keep her west-nor-west.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Captain Davenport put the wheel up and steadied her.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;West by north, Captain.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;West by north she is.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And now west.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Slowly, point by point, as she entered the lagoon, the PYRENEES&#10;described the circle that put her before the wind; and point by&#10;point, with all the calm certitude of a thousand years of time to&#10;spare, McCoy chanted the changing course.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Another point, Captain.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;A point it is.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Captain Davenport whirled several spokes over, suddenly&#10;reversing and coming back one to check her.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Steady.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Steady she is&#8212;right on it.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Despite the fact that the wind was now astern, the heat was so&#10;intense that Captain Davenport was compelled to steal sidelong&#10;glances into the binnacle, letting go the wheel now with one hand,&#10;now with the other, to rub or shield his blistering cheeks.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;McCoy&#39;s beard was crinkling and shriveling and the smell of it,&#10;strong in the other&#39;s nostrils, compelled him to look toward McCoy&#10;with sudden solicitude. Captain Davenport was letting go the spokes&#10;alternately with his hands in order to rub their blistering backs&#10;against his trousers. Every sail on the mizzenmast vanished in a&#10;rush of flame, compelling the two men to crouch and shield their&#10;faces.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Now,&#34; said McCoy, stealing a glance ahead at the low shore,&#10;&#34;four points up, Captain, and let her drive.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Shreds and patches of burning rope and canvas were falling about&#10;them and upon them. The tarry smoke from a smouldering piece of&#10;rope at the captain&#39;s feet set him off into a violent coughing fit,&#10;during which he still clung to the spokes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Pyrenees struck, her bow lifted and she ground ahead gently&#10;to a stop. A shower of burning fragments, dislodged by the shock,&#10;fell about them. The ship moved ahead again and struck a second&#10;time. She crushed the fragile coral under her keel, drove on, and&#10;struck a third time.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Hard over,&#34; said McCoy. &#34;Hard over?&#34; he questioned gently, a&#10;minute later.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;She won&#39;t answer,&#34; was the reply.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;All right. She is swinging around.&#34; &#39;mcCoy peered over the&#10;side. &#34;Soft, white sand. Couldn&#39;t ask better. A beautiful bed.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As the Pyrenees swung around her stern away from the wind, a&#10;fearful blast of smoke and flame poured aft. Captain Davenport&#10;deserted the wheel in blistering agony. He reached the painter of&#10;the boat that lay under the quarter, then looked for McCoy, who was&#10;standing aside to let him go down.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You first,&#34; the captain cried, gripping him by the shoulder and&#10;almost throwing him over the rail. But the flame and smoke were too&#10;terrible, and he followed hard after McCoy, both men wriggling on&#10;the rope and sliding down into the boat together. A sailor in the&#10;bow, without waiting for orders, slashed the painter through with&#10;his sheath knife. The oars, poised in readiness, bit into the&#10;water, and the boat shot away.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;a beautiful bed, Captain,&#34; McCoy murmured, looking back.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ay, a beautiful bed, and all thanks to you,&#34; was the&#10;answer.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The three boats pulled away for the white beach of pounded&#10;coral, beyond which, on the edge of a cocoanut grove, could be seen&#10;a half dozen grass houses and a score or more of excited natives,&#10;gazing wide-eyed at the conflagration that had come to land.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The boats grounded and they stepped out on the white beach.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And now,&#34; said McCoy, &#34;I must see about getting back to&#10;Pitcairn.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 9, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/1176', :deleted => 0)
