Text.create(:title => coder.decode('The Crystal Egg'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;There was, until a year ago, a little and very&#10;grimy-looking shop near Seven Dials, over which, in weather-worn&#10;yellow lettering, the name of &#34;C. Cave, Naturalist and Dealer in&#10;Antiquities,&#34; was inscribed. The contents of its window were&#10;curiously variegated. They comprised some elephant tusks and an&#10;imperfect set of chessmen, beads and weapons, a box of eyes, two&#10;skulls of tigers and one human, several moth-eaten stuffed monkeys&#10;(one holding a lamp), an old-fashioned cabinet, a flyblown ostrich&#10;egg or so, some fishing-tackle, and an extraordinarily dirty, empty&#10;glass fish-tank. There was also, at the moment the story begins, a&#10;mass of crystal, worked into the shape of an egg and brilliantly&#10;polished. And at that two people, who stood outside the window,&#10;were looking, one of them a tall, thin clergyman, the other a&#10;black-bearded young man of dusky complexion and unobtrusive&#10;costume.The dusky young man spoke with&#10;eager gesticulation, and seemed anxious for his companion to&#10;purchase the article.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;While they were there, Mr. Cave came into his shop, his beard&#10;still wagging with the bread and butter of his tea. When he saw&#10;these men and the object of their regard, his countenance fell. He&#10;glanced guiltily over his shoulder, and softly shut the door. He&#10;was a little old man, with pale face and peculiar watery blue eyes;&#10;his hair was a dirty grey, and he wore a shabby blue frock coat, an&#10;ancient silk hat, and carpet slippers very much down at heel. He&#10;remained watching the two men as they talked. The clergyman went&#10;deep into his trouser pocket, examined a handful of money, and&#10;showed his teeth in an agreeable smile. Mr. Cave seemed still more&#10;depressed when they came into the shop.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The clergyman, without any ceremony, asked the price of the&#10;crystal egg. Mr. Cave glanced nervously towards the door leading&#10;into the parlour, and said five pounds. The clergyman protested&#10;that the price was high, to his companion as well as to Mr. Cave&#8212;it&#10;was, indeed, very much more than Mr. Cave had intended to ask, when&#10;he had stocked the article&#8212;and an attempt at bargaining ensued. Mr.&#10;Cave stepped to the shop-door, and held it&#60;a id=&#34;Page_3&#34;&#62;&#60;/a&#62; open. &#34;Five pounds is my price,&#34; he said, as&#10;though he wished to save himself the trouble of unprofitable&#10;discussion. As he did so, the upper portion of a woman&#39;s face&#10;appeared above the blind in the glass upper panel of the door&#10;leading into the parlour, and stared curiously at the two&#10;customers. &#34;Five pounds is my price,&#34; said Mr. Cave, with a quiver&#10;in his voice.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The swarthy young man had so far remained a spectator, watching&#10;Cave keenly. Now he spoke. &#34;Give him five pounds,&#34; he said. The&#10;clergyman glanced at him to see if he were in earnest, and, when he&#10;looked at Mr. Cave again, he saw that the latter&#39;s face was white.&#10;&#34;It&#39;s a lot of money,&#34; said the clergyman, and, diving into his&#10;pocket, began counting his resources. He had little more than&#10;thirty shillings, and he appealed to his companion, with whom he&#10;seemed to be on terms of considerable intimacy. This gave Mr. Cave&#10;an opportunity of collecting his thoughts, and he began to explain&#10;in an agitated manner that the crystal was not, as a matter of&#10;fact, entirely free for sale. His two customers were naturally&#10;surprised at this, and inquired why he had not thought of that&#10;before he began to bargain. Mr. Cave became confused, but he stuck&#10;to his story, that the crystal was not in the market that&#10;afternoon,that a probable purchaser of it&#10;had already appeared. The two, treating this as an attempt to raise&#10;the price still further, made as if they would leave the shop. But&#10;at this point the parlour door opened, and the owner of the dark&#10;fringe and the little eyes appeared.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She was a coarse-featured, corpulent woman, younger and very&#10;much larger than Mr. Cave; she walked heavily, and her face was&#10;flushed. &#34;That crystal &#60;em&#62;is&#60;/em&#62; for sale,&#34; she said.&#10;&#34;And five pounds is a good enough price for it. I can&#39;t think what&#10;you&#39;re about, Cave, not to take the gentleman&#39;s offer!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Cave, greatly perturbed by the irruption, looked angrily at&#10;her over the rims of his spectacles, and, without excessive&#10;assurance, asserted his right to manage his business in his own&#10;way. An altercation began. The two customers watched the scene with&#10;interest and some amusement, occasionally assisting Mrs. Cave with&#10;suggestions. Mr. Cave, hard driven, persisted in a confused and&#10;impossible story of an enquiry for the crystal that morning, and&#10;his agitation became painful. But he stuck to his point with&#10;extraordinary persistence. It was the young Oriental who ended this&#10;curious controversy. He proposed that they should call&#60;a id=&#34;Page_5&#34;&#62;&#60;/a&#62; again in the course of two days&#8212;so as to give&#10;the alleged enquirer a fair chance. &#34;And then we must insist,&#34; said&#10;the clergyman, &#34;Five pounds.&#34; Mrs. Cave took it on herself to&#10;apologise for her husband, explaining that he was sometimes &#34;a&#10;little odd,&#34; and as the two customers left, the couple prepared for&#10;a free discussion of the incident in all its bearings.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mrs. Cave talked to her husband with singular directness. The&#10;poor little man, quivering with emotion, muddled himself between&#10;his stories, maintaining on the one hand that he had another&#10;customer in view, and on the other asserting that the crystal was&#10;honestly worth ten guineas. &#34;Why did you ask five pounds?&#34; said his&#10;wife. &#34;&#60;em&#62;Do&#60;/em&#62; let me manage my business my own way!&#34; said&#10;Mr. Cave.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Cave had living with him a step-daughter and a step-son, and&#10;at supper that night the transaction was re-discussed. None of them&#10;had a high opinion of Mr. Cave&#39;s business methods, and this action&#10;seemed a culminating folly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It&#39;s my opinion he&#39;s refused that crystal before,&#34; said the&#10;step-son, a loose-limbed lout of eighteen.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But &#60;em&#62;Five Pounds&#60;/em&#62;!&#34; said the step-daughter,&#60;a id=&#34;Page_6&#34;&#62;&#60;/a&#62; an argumentative young woman of&#10;six-and-twenty.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Cave&#39;s answers were wretched; he could only mumble weak&#10;assertions that he knew his own business best. They drove him from&#10;his half-eaten supper into the shop, to close it for the night, his&#10;ears aflame and tears of vexation behind his spectacles. &#34;Why had&#10;he left the crystal in the window so long? The folly of it!&#34; That&#10;was the trouble closest in his mind. For a time he could see no way&#10;of evading sale.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;After supper his step-daughter and step-son smartened themselves&#10;up and went out and his wife retired upstairs to reflect upon the&#10;business aspects of the crystal, over a little sugar and lemon and&#10;so forth in hot water. Mr. Cave went into the shop, and stayed&#10;there until late, ostensibly to make ornamental rockeries for&#10;goldfish cases but really for a private purpose that will be better&#10;explained later. The next day Mrs. Cave found that the crystal had&#10;been removed from the window, and was lying behind some second-hand&#10;books on angling. She replaced it in a conspicuous position. But&#10;she did not argue further about it, as a nervous headache&#10;disinclined her from debate. Mr. Cave was always disinclined. The&#10;day passed disagreeably.Mr. Cave was, if&#10;anything, more absent-minded than usual, and uncommonly irritable&#10;withal. In the afternoon, when his wife was taking her customary&#10;sleep, he removed the crystal from the window again.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The next day Mr. Cave had to deliver a consignment of dog-fish&#10;at one of the hospital schools, where they were needed for&#10;dissection. In his absence Mrs. Cave&#39;s mind reverted to the topic&#10;of the crystal, and the methods of expenditure suitable to a&#10;windfall of five pounds. She had already devised some very&#10;agreeable expedients, among others a dress of green silk for&#10;herself and a trip to Richmond, when a jangling of the front door&#10;bell summoned her into the shop. The customer was an examination&#10;coach who came to complain of the non-delivery of certain frogs&#10;asked for the previous day. Mrs. Cave did not approve of this&#10;particular branch of Mr. Cave&#39;s business, and the gentleman, who&#10;had called in a somewhat aggressive mood, retired after a brief&#10;exchange of words&#8212;entirely civil so far as he was concerned. Mrs.&#10;Cave&#39;s eye then naturally turned to the window; for the sight of&#10;the crystal was an assurance of the five pounds and of her dreams.&#10;What was her surprise to find it gone! &#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She went to the place behind the locker on the counter, where&#10;she had discovered it the day before. It was not there; and she&#10;immediately began an eager search about the shop.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When Mr. Cave returned from his business with the dog-fish,&#10;about a quarter to two in the afternoon, he found the shop in some&#10;confusion, and his wife, extremely exasperated and on her knees&#10;behind the counter, routing among his taxidermic material. Her face&#10;came up hot and angry over the counter, as the jangling bell&#10;announced his return, and she forthwith accused him of &#34;hiding&#10;it.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Hid &#60;em&#62;what&#60;/em&#62;?&#34; asked Mr. Cave.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The crystal!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At that Mr. Cave, apparently much surprised, rushed to the&#10;window. &#34;Isn&#39;t it here?&#34; he said. &#34;Great Heavens! what has become&#10;of it?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Just then, Mr. Cave&#39;s step-son re-entered the shop from the&#10;inner room&#8212;he had come home a minute or so before Mr. Cave&#8212;and he&#10;was blaspheming freely. He was apprenticed to a second-hand&#10;furniture dealer down the road, but he had his meals at home, and&#10;he was naturally annoyed to find no dinner ready.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But, when he heard of the loss of the crystal, he forgot his&#10;meal, and his anger was divertedfrom his&#10;mother to his step-father. Their first idea, of course, was that he&#10;had hidden it. But Mr. Cave stoutly denied all knowledge of its&#10;fate&#8212;freely offering his bedabbled affidavit in the matter&#8212;and at&#10;last was worked up to the point of accusing, first, his wife and&#10;then his step-son of having taken it with a view to a private sale.&#10;So began an exceedingly acrimonious and emotional discussion, which&#10;ended for Mrs. Cave in a peculiar nervous condition midway between&#10;hysterics and amuck, and caused the step-son to be half-an-hour&#10;late at the furniture establishment in the afternoon. Mr. Cave took&#10;refuge from his wife&#39;s emotions in the shop.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In the evening the matter was resumed, with less passion and in&#10;a judicial spirit, under the presidency of the step-daughter. The&#10;supper passed unhappily and culminated in a painful scene. Mr. Cave&#10;gave way at last to extreme exasperation, and went out banging the&#10;front door violently. The rest of the family, having discussed him&#10;with the freedom his absence warranted, hunted the house from&#10;garret to cellar, hoping to light upon the crystal.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The next day the two customers called again. They were received&#10;by Mrs. Cave almost in tears. It transpired that no&#10;one &#60;em&#62;could&#60;/em&#62; imagine all that she had&#10;stood from Cave at various times in her married pilgrimage&#8230; . She&#10;also gave a garbled account of the disappearance. The clergyman and&#10;the Oriental laughed silently at one another, and said it was very&#10;extraordinary. As Mrs. Cave seemed disposed to give them the&#10;complete history of her life they made to leave the shop. Thereupon&#10;Mrs. Cave, still clinging to hope, asked for the clergyman&#39;s&#10;address, so that, if she could get anything out of Cave, she might&#10;communicate it. The address was duly given, but apparently was&#10;afterwards mislaid. Mrs. Cave can remember nothing about it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In the evening of that day, the Caves seem to have exhausted&#10;their emotions, and Mr. Cave, who had been out in the afternoon,&#10;supped in a gloomy isolation that contrasted pleasantly with the&#10;impassioned controversy of the previous days. For some time matters&#10;were very badly strained in the Cave household, but neither crystal&#10;nor customer reappeared.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now, without mincing the matter, we must admit that Mr. Cave was&#10;a liar. He knew perfectly well where the crystal was. It was in the&#10;rooms of Mr. Jacoby Wace, Assistant Demonstrator at St. Catherine&#39;s&#10;Hospital,Westbourne Street. It stood on&#10;the sideboard partially covered by a black velvet cloth, and beside&#10;a decanter of American whisky. It is from Mr. Wace, indeed, that&#10;the particulars upon which this narrative is based were derived.&#10;Cave had taken off the thing to the hospital hidden in the dog-fish&#10;sack, and there had pressed the young investigator to keep it for&#10;him. Mr. Wace was a little dubious at first. His relationship to&#10;Cave was peculiar. He had a taste for singular characters, and he&#10;had more than once invited the old man to smoke and drink in his&#10;rooms, and to unfold his rather amusing views of life in general&#10;and of his wife in particular. Mr. Wace had encountered Mrs. Cave,&#10;too, on occasions when Mr. Cave was not at home to attend to him.&#10;He knew the constant interference to which Cave was subjected, and&#10;having weighed the story judicially, he decided to give the crystal&#10;a refuge. Mr. Cave promised to explain the reasons for his&#10;remarkable affection for the crystal more fully on a later&#10;occasion, but he spoke distinctly of seeing visions therein. He&#10;called on Mr. Wace the same evening.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He told a complicated story. The crystal he said had come into&#10;his possession with other oddments at the forced sale of another&#10;curiositydealer&#39;s effects, and not&#10;knowing what its value might be, he had ticketed it at ten&#10;shillings. It had hung upon his hands at that price for some&#10;months, and he was thinking of &#34;reducing the figure,&#34; when he made&#10;a singular discovery.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At that time his health was very bad&#8212;and it must be borne in&#10;mind that, throughout all this experience, his physical condition&#10;was one of ebb&#8212;and he was in considerable distress by reason of the&#10;negligence, the positive ill-treatment even, he received from his&#10;wife and step-children. His wife was vain, extravagant, unfeeling,&#10;and had a growing taste for private drinking; his step-daughter was&#10;mean and over-reaching; and his step-son had conceived a violent&#10;dislike for him, and lost no chance of showing it. The requirements&#10;of his business pressed heavily upon him, and Mr. Wace does not&#10;think that he was altogether free from occasional intemperance. He&#10;had begun life in a comfortable position, he was a man of fair&#10;education, and he suffered, for weeks at a stretch, from&#10;melancholia and insomnia. Afraid to disturb his family, he would&#10;slip quietly from his wife&#39;s side, when his thoughts became&#10;intolerable, and wander about the house. And about&#60;a id=&#34;Page_13&#34;&#62;&#60;/a&#62; three o&#39;clock one morning, late in August,&#10;chance directed him into the shop.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The dirty little place was impenetrably black except in one&#10;spot, where he perceived an unusual glow of light. Approaching&#10;this, he discovered it to be the crystal egg, which was standing on&#10;the corner of the counter towards the window. A thin ray smote&#10;through a crack in the shutters, impinged upon the object, and&#10;seemed as it were to fill its entire interior.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It occurred to Mr. Cave that this was not in accordance with the&#10;laws of optics as he had known them in his younger days. He could&#10;understand the rays being refracted by the crystal and coming to a&#10;focus in its interior, but this diffusion jarred with his physical&#10;conceptions. He approached the crystal nearly, peering into it and&#10;round it, with a transient revival of the scientific curiosity that&#10;in his youth had determined his choice of a calling. He was&#10;surprised to find the light not steady, but writhing within the&#10;substance of the egg, as though that object was a hollow sphere of&#10;some luminous vapour. In moving about to get different points of&#10;view, he suddenly found that he had come between it and the ray,&#10;and that the crystal none the less remained luminous.&#60;a id=&#34;Page_14&#34;&#62;&#60;/a&#62; Greatly astonished, he lifted it out of the&#10;light ray and carried it to the darkest part of the shop. It&#10;remained bright for some four or five minutes, when it slowly faded&#10;and went out. He placed it in the thin streak of daylight, and its&#10;luminousness was almost immediately restored.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So far, at least, Mr. Wace was able to verify the remarkable&#10;story of Mr. Cave. He has himself repeatedly held this crystal in a&#10;ray of light (which had to be of a less diameter than one&#10;millimetre). And in a perfect darkness, such as could be produced&#10;by velvet wrapping, the crystal did undoubtedly appear very faintly&#10;phosphorescent. It would seem, however, that the luminousness was&#10;of some exceptional sort, and not equally visible to all eyes; for&#10;Mr. Harbinger&#8212;whose name will be familiar to the scientific reader&#10;in connection with the Pasteur Institute&#8212;was quite unable to see&#10;any light whatever. And Mr. Wace&#39;s own capacity for its&#10;appreciation was out of comparison inferior to that of Mr. Cave&#39;s.&#10;Even with Mr. Cave the power varied very considerably: his vision&#10;was most vivid during states of extreme weakness and fatigue.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now, from the outset this light in the crystal exercised a&#10;curious fascination upon Mr. Cave.And it&#10;says more for his loneliness of soul than a volume of pathetic&#10;writing could do, that he told no human being of his curious&#10;observations. He seems to have been living in such an atmosphere of&#10;petty spite that to admit the existence of a pleasure would have&#10;been to risk the loss of it. He found that as the dawn advanced,&#10;and the amount of diffused light increased, the crystal became to&#10;all appearance non-luminous. And for some time he was unable to see&#10;anything in it, except at night-time, in dark corners of the&#10;shop.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But the use of an old velvet cloth, which he used as a&#10;background for a collection of minerals, occurred to him, and by&#10;doubling this, and putting it over his head and hands, he was able&#10;to get a sight of the luminous movement within the crystal even in&#10;the daytime. He was very cautious lest he should be thus discovered&#10;by his wife, and he practised this occupation only in the&#10;afternoons, while she was asleep upstairs, and then circumspectly&#10;in a hollow under the counter. And one day, turning the crystal&#10;about in his hands, he saw something. It came and went like a&#10;flash, but it gave him the impression that the object had for a&#10;moment opened to him the view of a wide and spacious and strange&#10;country; and, turningit about, he did,&#10;just as the light faded, see the same vision again.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now, it would be tedious and unnecessary to state all the phases&#10;of Mr. Cave&#39;s discovery from this point. Suffice that the effect&#10;was this: the crystal, being peered into at an angle of about 137&#10;degrees from the direction of the illuminating ray, gave a clear&#10;and consistent picture of a wide and peculiar countryside. It was&#10;not dream-like at all: it produced a definite impression of&#10;reality, and the better the light the more real and solid it&#10;seemed. It was a moving picture: that is to say, certain objects&#10;moved in it, but slowly in an orderly manner like real things, and,&#10;according as the direction of the lighting and vision changed, the&#10;picture changed also. It must, indeed, have been like looking&#10;through an oval glass at a view, and turning the glass about to get&#10;at different aspects.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Cave&#39;s statements, Mr. Wace assures me, were extremely&#10;circumstantial, and entirely free from any of that emotional&#10;quality that taints hallucinatory impressions. But it must be&#10;remembered that all the efforts of Mr. Wace to see any similar&#10;clarity in the faint opalescence of the crystal were wholly&#10;unsuccessful, try as he would. The difference in&#60;a id=&#34;Page_17&#34;&#62;&#60;/a&#62; intensity of the impressions received by the&#10;two men was very great, and it is quite conceivable that what was a&#10;view to Mr. Cave was a mere blurred nebulosity to Mr. Wace.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The view, as Mr. Cave described it, was invariably of an&#10;extensive plain, and he seemed always to be looking at it from a&#10;considerable height, as if from a tower or a mast. To the east and&#10;to the west the plain was bounded at a remote distance by vast&#10;reddish cliffs, which reminded him of those he had seen in some&#10;picture; but what the picture was Mr. Wace was unable to ascertain.&#10;These cliffs passed north and south&#8212;he could tell the points of the&#10;compass by the stars that were visible of a night&#8212;receding in an&#10;almost illimitable perspective and fading into the mists of the&#10;distance before they met. He was nearer the eastern set of cliffs,&#10;on the occasion of his first vision the sun was rising over them,&#10;and black against the sunlight and pale against their shadow&#10;appeared a multitude of soaring forms that Mr. Cave regarded as&#10;birds. A vast range of buildings spread below him; he seemed to be&#10;looking down upon them; and, as they approached the blurred and&#10;refracted edge of the picture, they became indistinct. There were&#10;also trees curious in shape, and in colouring, a deep&#60;a id=&#34;Page_18&#34;&#62;&#60;/a&#62; mossy green and an exquisite grey, beside a&#10;wide and shining canal. And something great and brilliantly&#10;coloured flew across the picture. But the first time Mr. Cave saw&#10;these pictures he saw only in flashes, his hands shook, his head&#10;moved, the vision came and went, and grew foggy and indistinct. And&#10;at first he had the greatest difficulty in finding the picture&#10;again once the direction of it was lost.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;His next clear vision, which came about a week after the first,&#10;the interval having yielded nothing but tantalising glimpses and&#10;some useful experience, showed him the view down the length of the&#10;valley. The view was different, but he had a curious persuasion,&#10;which his subsequent observations abundantly confirmed, that he was&#10;regarding this strange world from exactly the same spot, although&#10;he was looking in a different direction. The long fa&#231;ade of the&#10;great building, whose roof he had looked down upon before, was now&#10;receding in perspective. He recognised the roof. In the front of&#10;the fa&#231;ade was a terrace of massive proportions and extraordinary&#10;length, and down the middle of the terrace, at certain intervals,&#10;stood huge but very graceful masts, bearing small shiny objects&#10;which reflected the setting sun. The import of these small objects&#10;did notoccur to Mr. Cave until some time&#10;after, as he was describing the scene to Mr. Wace. The terrace&#10;overhung a thicket of the most luxuriant and graceful vegetation,&#10;and beyond this was a wide grassy lawn on which certain broad&#10;creatures, in form like beetles but enormously larger, reposed.&#10;Beyond this again was a richly decorated causeway of pinkish stone;&#10;and beyond that, and lined with dense &#60;em&#62;red&#60;/em&#62; weeds,&#10;and passing up the valley exactly parallel with the distant cliffs,&#10;was a broad and mirror-like expanse of water. The air seemed full&#10;of squadrons of great birds, man&#339;uvring in stately curves; and&#10;across the river was a multitude of splendid buildings, richly&#10;coloured and glittering with metallic tracery and facets, among a&#10;forest of moss-like and lichenous trees. And suddenly something&#10;flapped repeatedly across the vision, like the fluttering of a&#10;jewelled fan or the beating of a wing, and a face, or rather the&#10;upper part of a face with very large eyes, came as it were close to&#10;his own and as if on the other side of the crystal. Mr. Cave was so&#10;startled and so impressed by the absolute reality of these eyes,&#10;that he drew his head back from the crystal to look behind it. He&#10;had become so absorbed in watching that he was quite surprised to&#10;find himself in the cool darkness ofhis&#10;little shop, with its familiar odour of methyl, mustiness, and&#10;decay. And, as he blinked about him, the glowing crystal faded, and&#10;went out.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Such were the first general impressions of Mr. Cave. The story&#10;is curiously direct and circumstantial. From the outset, when the&#10;valley first flashed momentarily on his senses, his imagination was&#10;strangely affected, and, as he began to appreciate the details of&#10;the scene he saw, his wonder rose to the point of a passion. He&#10;went about his business listless and distraught, thinking only of&#10;the time when he should be able to return to his watching. And then&#10;a few weeks after his first sight of the valley came the two&#10;customers, the stress and excitement of their offer, and the narrow&#10;escape of the crystal from sale, as I have already told.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now, while the thing was Mr. Cave&#39;s secret, it remained a mere&#10;wonder, a thing to creep to covertly and peep at, as a child might&#10;peep upon a forbidden garden. But Mr. Wace has, for a young&#10;scientific investigator, a particularly lucid and consecutive habit&#10;of mind. Directly the crystal and its story came to him, and he had&#10;satisfied himself, by seeing the phosphorescence with his own eyes,&#10;that there reallywas a certain evidence&#10;for Mr. Cave&#39;s statements, he proceeded to develop the matter&#10;systematically. Mr. Cave was only too eager to come and feast his&#10;eyes on this wonderland he saw, and he came every night from&#10;half-past eight until half-past ten, and sometimes, in Mr. Wace&#39;s&#10;absence, during the day. On Sunday afternoons, also, he came. From&#10;the outset Mr. Wace made copious notes, and it was due to his&#10;scientific method that the relation between the direction from&#10;which the initiating ray entered the crystal and the orientation of&#10;the picture were proved. And, by covering the crystal in a box&#10;perforated only with a small aperture to admit the exciting ray,&#10;and by substituting black holland for his buff blinds, he greatly&#10;improved the conditions of the observations; so that in a little&#10;while they were able to survey the valley in any direction they&#10;desired.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So having cleared the way, we may give a brief account of this&#10;visionary world within the crystal. The things were in all cases&#10;seen by Mr. Cave, and the method of working was invariably for him&#10;to watch the crystal and report what he saw, while Mr. Wace (who as&#10;a science student had learnt the trick of writing in the dark)&#10;wrote a brief note of his report. When the crystal faded, it was&#10;put into its boxin the proper position&#10;and the electric light turned on. Mr. Wace asked questions, and&#10;suggested observations to clear up difficult points. Nothing,&#10;indeed, could have been less visionary and more matter-of-fact.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The attention of Mr. Cave had been speedily directed to the&#10;bird-like creatures he had seen so abundantly present in each of&#10;his earlier visions. His first impression was soon corrected, and&#10;he considered for a time that they might represent a diurnal&#10;species of bat. Then he thought, grotesquely enough, that they&#10;might be cherubs. Their heads were round, and curiously human, and&#10;it was the eyes of one of them that had so startled him on his&#10;second observation. They had broad, silvery wings, not feathered,&#10;but glistening almost as brilliantly as new-killed fish and with&#10;the same subtle play of colour, and these wings were not built on&#10;the plan of bird-wing or bat, Mr. Wace learned, but supported by&#10;curved ribs radiating from the body. (A sort of butterfly wing with&#10;curved ribs seems best to express their appearance.) The body was&#10;small, but fitted with two bunches of prehensile organs, like long&#10;tentacles, immediately under the mouth. Incredible as it appeared&#10;to Mr. Wace, the persuasion at last became irresistible, that it&#10;wasthese creatures which owned the great&#10;quasi-human buildings and the magnificent garden that made the&#10;broad valley so splendid. And Mr. Cave perceived that the&#10;buildings, with other peculiarities, had no doors, but that the&#10;great circular windows, which opened freely, gave the creatures&#10;egress and entrance. They would alight upon their tentacles, fold&#10;their wings to a smallness almost rod-like, and hop into the&#10;interior. But among them was a multitude of smaller-winged&#10;creatures, like great dragon-flies and moths and flying beetles,&#10;and across the greensward brilliantly-coloured gigantic&#10;ground-beetles crawled lazily to and fro. Moreover, on the&#10;causeways and terraces, large-headed creatures similar to the&#10;greater winged flies, but wingless, were visible, hopping busily&#10;upon their hand-like tangle of tentacles.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Allusion has already been made to the glittering objects upon&#10;masts that stood upon the terrace of the nearer building. It dawned&#10;upon Mr. Cave, after regarding one of these masts very fixedly on&#10;one particularly vivid day, that the glittering object there was a&#10;crystal exactly like that into which he peered. And a still more&#10;careful scrutiny convinced him that each&#60;a id=&#34;Page_24&#34;&#62;&#60;/a&#62; one in a vista of nearly twenty carried a&#10;similar object.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Occasionally one of the large flying creatures would flutter up&#10;to one, and, folding its wings and coiling a number of its&#10;tentacles about the mast, would regard the crystal fixedly for a&#10;space,&#8212;sometimes for as long as fifteen minutes. And a series of&#10;observations, made at the suggestion of Mr. Wace, convinced both&#10;watchers that, so far as this visionary world was concerned, the&#10;crystal into which they peered actually stood at the summit of the&#10;endmost mast on the terrace, and that on one occasion at least one&#10;of these inhabitants of this other world had looked into Mr. Cave&#39;s&#10;face while he was making these observations.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So much for the essential facts of this very singular story.&#10;Unless we dismiss it all as the ingenious fabrication of Mr. Wace,&#10;we have to believe one of two things: either that Mr. Cave&#39;s&#10;crystal was in two worlds at once, and that, while it was carried&#10;about in one, it remained stationary in the other, which seems&#10;altogether absurd; or else that it had some peculiar relation of&#10;sympathy with another and exactly similar crystal in this other&#10;world, so that what was seen in the interior of the one in this&#10;world was, under suitable conditions,&#60;a id=&#34;Page_25&#34;&#62;&#60;/a&#62; visible to an observer in the corresponding&#10;crystal in the other world; and &#60;em&#62;vice versa&#60;/em&#62;. At&#10;present, indeed, we do not know of any way in which two crystals&#10;could so come &#60;em&#62;en rapport&#60;/em&#62;, but nowadays we know enough&#10;to understand that the thing is not altogether impossible. This&#10;view of the crystals as &#60;em&#62;en rapport&#60;/em&#62; was the&#10;supposition that occurred to Mr. Wace, and to me at least it seems&#10;extremely plausible&#8230; .&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And where was this other world? On this, also, the alert&#10;intelligence of Mr. Wace speedily threw light. After sunset, the&#10;sky darkened rapidly&#8212;there was a very brief twilight interval&#10;indeed&#8212;and the stars shone out. They were recognisably the same as&#10;those we see, arranged in the same constellations. Mr. Cave&#10;recognised the Bear, the Pleiades, Aldebaran, and Sirius: so that&#10;the other world must be somewhere in the solar system, and, at the&#10;utmost, only a few hundreds of millions of miles from our own.&#10;Following up this clue, Mr. Wace learned that the midnight sky was&#10;a darker blue even than our midwinter sky, and that the sun seemed&#10;a little smaller. &#60;em&#62;And there were two small&#10;moons!&#60;/em&#62; &#34;like our moon but smaller, and quite differently&#10;marked&#34; one of which moved so rapidly that its motion was&#60;a id=&#34;Page_26&#34;&#62;&#60;/a&#62; clearly visible as one regarded it. These moons&#10;were never high in the sky, but vanished as they rose: that is,&#10;every time they revolved they were eclipsed because they were so&#10;near their primary planet. And all this answers quite completely,&#10;although Mr. Cave did not know it, to what must be the condition of&#10;things on Mars.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Indeed, it seems an exceedingly plausible conclusion that&#10;peering into this crystal Mr. Cave did actually see the planet Mars&#10;and its inhabitants. And, if that be the case, then the evening&#10;star that shone so brilliantly in the sky of that distant vision,&#10;was neither more nor less than our own familiar earth.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For a time the Martians&#8212;if they were Martians&#8212;do not seem to&#10;have known of Mr. Cave&#39;s inspection. Once or twice one would come&#10;to peer, and go away very shortly to some other mast, as though the&#10;vision was unsatisfactory. During this time Mr. Cave was able to&#10;watch the proceedings of these winged people without being&#10;disturbed by their attentions, and, although his report is&#10;necessarily vague and fragmentary, it is nevertheless very&#10;suggestive. Imagine the impression of humanity a Martian observer&#10;would get who, after a difficult process of preparation and with&#10;considerablefatigue to the eyes, was able&#10;to peer at London from the steeple of St. Martin&#39;s Church for&#10;stretches, at longest, of four minutes at a time. Mr. Cave was&#10;unable to ascertain if the winged Martians were the same as the&#10;Martians who hopped about the causeways and terraces, and if the&#10;latter could put on wings at will. He several times saw certain&#10;clumsy bipeds, dimly suggestive of apes, white and partially&#10;translucent, feeding among certain of the lichenous trees, and once&#10;some of these fled before one of the hopping, round-headed&#10;Martians. The latter caught one in its tentacles, and then the&#10;picture faded suddenly and left Mr. Cave most tantalisingly in the&#10;dark. On another occasion a vast thing, that Mr. Cave thought at&#10;first was some gigantic insect, appeared advancing along the&#10;causeway beside the canal with extraordinary rapidity. As this drew&#10;nearer Mr. Cave perceived that it was a mechanism of shining metals&#10;and of extraordinary complexity. And then, when he looked again, it&#10;had passed out of sight.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;After a time Mr. Wace aspired to attract the attention of the&#10;Martians, and the next time that the strange eyes of one of them&#10;appeared close to the crystal Mr. Cave cried out and sprang away,&#10;and they immediately turned onthe light&#10;and began to gesticulate in a manner suggestive of signalling. But&#10;when at last Mr. Cave examined the crystal again the Martian had&#10;departed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Thus far these observations had progressed in early November,&#10;and then Mr. Cave, feeling that the suspicions of his family about&#10;the crystal were allayed, began to take it to and fro with him in&#10;order that, as occasion arose in the daytime or night, he might&#10;comfort himself with what was fast becoming the most real thing in&#10;his existence.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In December Mr. Wace&#39;s work in connection with a forthcoming&#10;examination became heavy, the sittings were reluctantly suspended&#10;for a week, and for ten or eleven days&#8212;he is not quite sure&#10;which&#8212;he saw nothing of Cave. He then grew anxious to resume these&#10;investigations, and, the stress of his seasonal labours being&#10;abated, he went down to Seven Dials. At the corner he noticed a&#10;shutter before a bird fancier&#39;s window, and then another at a&#10;cobbler&#39;s. Mr. Cave&#39;s shop was closed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He rapped and the door was opened by the step-son in black. He&#10;at once called Mrs. Cave, who was, Mr. Wace could not but observe,&#10;in cheap but ample widow&#39;s weeds of the most imposing pattern.&#10;Without any verygreat surprise Mr. Wace&#10;learnt that Cave was dead and already buried. She was in tears, and&#10;her voice was a little thick. She had just returned from Highgate.&#10;Her mind seemed occupied with her own prospects and the honourable&#10;details of the obsequies, but Mr. Wace was at last able to learn&#10;the particulars of Cave&#39;s death. He had been found dead in his shop&#10;in the early morning, the day after his last visit to Mr. Wace, and&#10;the crystal had been clasped in his stone-cold hands. His face was&#10;smiling, said Mrs. Cave, and the velvet cloth from the minerals lay&#10;on the floor at his feet. He must have been dead five or six hours&#10;when he was found.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;This came as a great shock to Wace, and he began to reproach&#10;himself bitterly for having neglected the plain symptoms of the old&#10;man&#39;s ill-health. But his chief thought was of the crystal. He&#10;approached that topic in a gingerly manner, because he knew Mrs.&#10;Cave&#39;s peculiarities. He was dumbfoundered to learn that it was&#10;sold.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mrs. Cave&#39;s first impulse, directly Cave&#39;s body had been taken&#10;upstairs, had been to write to the mad clergyman who had offered&#10;five pounds for the crystal, informing him of its recovery; but&#10;after a violent hunt in which herdaughter&#10;joined her, they were convinced of the loss of his address. As they&#10;were without the means required to mourn and bury Cave in the&#10;elaborate style the dignity of an old Seven Dials inhabitant&#10;demands, they had appealed to a friendly fellow-tradesman in Great&#10;Portland Street. He had very kindly taken over a portion of the&#10;stock at a valuation. The valuation was his own and the crystal egg&#10;was included in one of the lots. Mr. Wace, after a few suitable&#10;consolatory observations, a little off-handedly proffered perhaps,&#10;hurried at once to Great Portland Street. But there he learned that&#10;the crystal egg had already been sold to a tall, dark man in grey.&#10;And there the material facts in this curious, and to me at least&#10;very suggestive, story come abruptly to an end. The Great Portland&#10;Street dealer did not know who the tall dark man in grey was, nor&#10;had he observed him with sufficient attention to describe him&#10;minutely. He did not even know which way this person had gone after&#10;leaving the shop. For a time Mr. Wace remained in the shop, trying&#10;the dealer&#39;s patience with hopeless questions, venting his own&#10;exasperation. And at last, realising abruptly that the whole thing&#10;had passed out of his hands, had vanished like a vision of the&#10;night, he returnedto his own rooms, a&#10;little astonished to find the notes he had made still tangible and&#10;visible upon his untidy table.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;His annoyance and disappointment were naturally very great. He&#10;made a second call (equally ineffectual) upon the Great Portland&#10;Street dealer, and he resorted to advertisements in such&#10;periodicals as were likely to come into the hands of&#10;a &#60;em&#62;bric-a-brac&#60;/em&#62; collector. He also wrote letters&#10;to &#60;em&#62;The Daily Chronicle&#60;/em&#62; and &#60;em&#62;Nature&#60;/em&#62;,&#10;but both those periodicals, suspecting a hoax, asked him to&#10;reconsider his action before they printed, and he was advised that&#10;such a strange story, unfortunately so bare of supporting evidence,&#10;might imperil his reputation as an investigator. Moreover, the&#10;calls of his proper work were urgent. So that after a month or so,&#10;save for an occasional reminder to certain dealers, he had&#10;reluctantly to abandon the quest for the crystal egg, and from that&#10;day to this it remains undiscovered. Occasionally, however, he&#10;tells me, and I can quite believe him, he has bursts of zeal, in&#10;which he abandons his more urgent occupation and resumes the&#10;search.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Whether or not it will remain lost for ever, with the material&#10;and origin of it, are things equally speculative at the present&#10;time. If the present purchaser is a collector,&#10;one would have expected the enquiries of Mr. Wace to have reached&#10;him through the dealers. He has been able to discover Mr. Cave&#39;s&#10;clergyman and &#34;Oriental&#34;&#8212;no other than the Rev. James Parker and&#10;the young Prince of Bosso-Kuni in Java. I am obliged to them for&#10;certain particulars. The object of the Prince was simply&#10;curiosity&#8212;and extravagance. He was so eager to buy, because Cave&#10;was so oddly reluctant to sell. It is just as possible that the&#10;buyer in the second instance was simply a casual purchaser and not&#10;a collector at all, and the crystal egg, for all I know, may at the&#10;present moment be within a mile of me, decorating a drawing-room or&#10;serving as a paper-weight&#8212;its remarkable functions all unknown.&#10;Indeed, it is partly with the idea of such a possibility that I&#10;have thrown this narrative into a form that will give it a chance&#10;of being read by the ordinary consumer of fiction.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;My own ideas in the matter are practically identical with those&#10;of Mr. Wace. I believe the crystal on the mast in Mars and the&#10;crystal egg of Mr. Cave&#39;s to be in some physical, but at present&#10;quite inexplicable, way &#60;em&#62;en rapport&#60;/em&#62;, and we both&#10;believe further that the terrestrial crystal must have&#10;been&#8212;possibly at some remotedate&#8212;sent&#10;hither from that planet, in order to give the Martians a near view&#10;of our affairs. Possibly the fellows to the crystals in the other&#10;masts are also on our globe. No theory of hallucination suffices&#10;for the facts.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 7, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/3469', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('The Star'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was on the first day of the new year that the&#10;announcement was made, almost simultaneously from three&#10;observatories, that the motion of the planet Neptune, the outermost&#10;of all the planets that wheel about the sun, had become very&#10;erratic. Ogilvy had already called attention to a suspected&#10;retardation in its velocity in December. Such a piece of news was&#10;scarcely calculated to interest a world the greater portion of&#10;whose inhabitants were unaware of the existence of the planet&#10;Neptune, nor outside the astronomical profession did the subsequent&#10;discovery of a faint remote speck of light in the region of the&#10;perturbed planet cause any very great excitement. Scientific&#10;people, however, found the intelligence remarkable enough, even&#10;before it became known that the new body was rapidly growing larger&#10;and brighter, that its motion was quite different from the orderly&#10;progress of the planets, and that the deflection of Neptune and&#10;itssatellite was becoming now of an&#10;unprecedented kind.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Few people without a training in science can realise the huge&#10;isolation of the solar system. The sun with its specks of planets,&#10;its dust of planetoids, and its impalpable comets, swims in a&#10;vacant immensity that almost defeats the imagination. Beyond the&#10;orbit of Neptune there is space, vacant so far as human observation&#10;has penetrated, without warmth or light or sound, blank emptiness,&#10;for twenty million times a million miles. That is the smallest&#10;estimate of the distance to be traversed before the very nearest of&#10;the stars is attained. And, saving a few comets more unsubstantial&#10;than the thinnest flame, no matter had ever to human knowledge&#10;crossed this gulf of space, until early in the twentieth century&#10;this strange wanderer appeared. A vast mass of matter it was,&#10;bulky, heavy, rushing without warning out of the black mystery of&#10;the sky into the radiance of the sun. By the second day it was&#10;clearly visible to any decent instrument, as a speck with a barely&#10;sensible diameter, in the constellation Leo near Regulus. In a&#10;little while an opera glass could attain it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;On the third day of the new year the newspaper readers of two&#10;hemispheres were madeaware for the first&#10;time of the real importance of this unusual apparition in the&#10;heavens. &#34;A Planetary Collision,&#34; one London paper headed the news,&#10;and proclaimed Duchaine&#39;s opinion that this strange new planet&#10;would probably collide with Neptune. The leader writers enlarged&#10;upon the topic. So that in most of the capitals of the world, on&#10;January 3rd, there was an expectation, however vague of some&#10;imminent phenomenon in the sky; and as the night followed the&#10;sunset round the globe, thousands of men turned their eyes skyward&#10;to see&#8212;the old familiar stars just as they had always been.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Until it was dawn in London and Pollux setting and the stars&#10;overhead grown pale. The Winter&#39;s dawn it was, a sickly filtering&#10;accumulation of daylight, and the light of gas and candles shone&#10;yellow in the windows to show where people were astir. But the&#10;yawning policeman saw the thing, the busy crowds in the markets&#10;stopped agape, workmen going to their work betimes, milkmen, the&#10;drivers of news-carts, dissipation going home jaded and pale,&#10;homeless wanderers, sentinels on their beats, and in the country,&#10;labourers trudging afield, poachers slinking home, all over the&#10;dusky quickening country it could be seen&#8212;and out at sea by seamen&#10;watching for the day&#8212;agreat white star,&#10;come suddenly into the westward sky!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Brighter it was than any star in our skies; brighter than the&#10;evening star at its brightest. It still glowed out white and large,&#10;no mere twinkling spot of light, but a small round clear shining&#10;disc, an hour after the day had come. And where science has not&#10;reached, men stared and feared, telling one another of the wars and&#10;pestilences that are foreshadowed by these fiery signs in the&#10;Heavens. Sturdy Boers, dusky Hottentots, Gold Coast negroes,&#10;Frenchmen, Spaniards, Portuguese, stood in the warmth of the&#10;sunrise watching the setting of this strange new star.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And in a hundred observatories there had been suppressed&#10;excitement, rising almost to shouting pitch, as the two remote&#10;bodies had rushed together, and a hurrying to and fro, to gather&#10;photographic apparatus and spectroscope, and this appliance and&#10;that, to record this novel astonishing sight, the destruction of a&#10;world. For it was a world, a sister planet of our earth, far&#10;greater than our earth indeed, that had so suddenly flashed into&#10;flaming death. Neptune it was, had been struck, fairly and&#10;squarely, by the strange planet from outer space and the heat of&#10;the concussion had incontinentlyturned&#10;two solid globes into one vast mass of incandescence. Round the&#10;world that day, two hours before the dawn, went the pallid great&#10;white star, fading only as it sank westward and the sun mounted&#10;above it. Everywhere men marvelled at it, but of all those who saw&#10;it none could have marvelled more than those sailors, habitual&#10;watchers of the stars, who far away at sea had heard nothing of its&#10;advent and saw it now rise like a pigmy moon and climb zenithward&#10;and hang overhead and sink westward with the passing of the&#10;night.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And when next it rose over Europe everywhere were crowds of&#10;watchers on hilly slopes, on house-roofs, in open spaces, staring&#10;eastward for the rising of the great new star. It rose with a white&#10;glow in front of it, like the glare of a white fire, and those who&#10;had seen it come into existence the night before cried out at the&#10;sight of it. &#34;It is larger,&#34; they cried. &#34;It is brighter!&#34; And,&#10;indeed the moon a quarter full and sinking in the west was in its&#10;apparent size beyond comparison, but scarcely in all its breadth&#10;had it as much brightness now as the little circle of the strange&#10;new star.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It is brighter!&#34; cried the people clustering in the streets.&#10;But in the dim observatories thewatchers&#10;held their breath and peered at one another. &#34;&#60;em&#62;It is&#10;nearer&#60;/em&#62;,&#34; they said. &#34;&#60;em&#62;Nearer!&#60;/em&#62;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And voice after voice repeated, &#34;It is nearer,&#34; and the clicking&#10;telegraph took that up, and it trembled along telephone wires, and&#10;in a thousand cities grimy compositors fingered the type. &#34;It is&#10;nearer.&#34; Men writing in offices, struck with a strange realisation,&#10;flung down their pens, men talking in a thousand places suddenly&#10;came upon a grotesque possibility in those words, &#34;It is nearer.&#34;&#10;It hurried along awakening streets, it was shouted down the&#10;frost-stilled ways of quiet villages, men who had read these things&#10;from the throbbing tape stood in yellow-lit doorways shouting the&#10;news to the passers-by. &#34;It is nearer.&#34; Pretty women, flushed and&#10;glittering, heard the news told jestingly between the dances, and&#10;feigned an intelligent interest they did not feel. &#34;Nearer! Indeed.&#10;How curious! How very, very clever people must be to find out&#10;things like that!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Lonely tramps faring through the wintry night murmured those&#10;words to comfort themselves&#8212;looking skyward. &#34;It has need to be&#10;nearer, for the night&#39;s as cold as charity. Don&#39;t seem much warmth&#10;from it if it &#60;em&#62;is&#60;/em&#62; nearer, all the same.&#34;&#60;a id=&#34;Page_43&#34;&#62;&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What is a new star to me?&#34; cried the weeping woman kneeling&#10;beside her dead.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The schoolboy, rising early for his examination work, puzzled it&#10;out for himself&#8212;with the great white star, shining broad and bright&#10;through the frost-flowers of his window. &#34;Centrifugal,&#10;centripetal,&#34; he said, with his chin on his fist. &#34;Stop a planet in&#10;its flight, rob it of its centrifugal force, what then? Centripetal&#10;has it, and down it falls into the sun! And this&#8212;!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Do &#60;em&#62;we&#60;/em&#62; come in the way? I wonder&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The light of that day went the way of its brethren, and with the&#10;later watches of the frosty darkness rose the strange star again.&#10;And it was now so bright that the waxing moon seemed but a pale&#10;yellow ghost of itself, hanging huge in the sunset. In a South&#10;African city a great man had married, and the streets were alight&#10;to welcome his return with his bride. &#34;Even the skies have&#10;illuminated,&#34; said the flatterer. Under Capricorn, two negro&#10;lovers, daring the wild beasts and evil spirits, for love of one&#10;another, crouched together in a cane brake where the fire-flies&#10;hovered. &#34;That is our star,&#34; they whispered, and felt strangely&#10;comforted by the sweet brilliance of its light.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The master mathematician sat in his private&#60;a id=&#34;Page_44&#34;&#62;&#60;/a&#62; room and pushed the papers from him. His&#10;calculations were already finished. In a small white phial there&#10;still remained a little of the drug that had kept him awake and&#10;active for four long nights. Each day, serene, explicit, patient as&#10;ever, he had given his lecture to his students, and then had come&#10;back at once to this momentous calculation. His face was grave, a&#10;little drawn and hectic from his drugged activity. For some time he&#10;seemed lost in thought. Then he went to the window, and the blind&#10;went up with a click. Half way up the sky, over the clustering&#10;roofs, chimneys and steeples of the city, hung the star.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He looked at it as one might look into the eyes of a brave&#10;enemy. &#34;You may kill me,&#34; he said after a silence. &#34;But I can hold&#10;you&#8212;and all the universe for that matter&#8212;in the grip of this little&#10;brain. I would not change. Even now.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He looked at the little phial. &#34;There will be no need of sleep&#10;again,&#34; he said. The next day at noon, punctual to the minute, he&#10;entered his lecture theatre, put his hat on the end of the table as&#10;his habit was, and carefully selected a large piece of chalk. It&#10;was a joke among his students that he could not lecture without&#10;that piece of chalk to fumble in his fingers, and once&#60;a id=&#34;Page_45&#34;&#62;&#60;/a&#62; he had been stricken to impotence by their&#10;hiding his supply. He came and looked under his grey eyebrows at&#10;the rising tiers of young fresh faces, and spoke with his&#10;accustomed studied commonness of phrasing. &#34;Circumstances have&#10;arisen&#8212;circumstances beyond my control,&#34; he said and paused, &#34;which&#10;will debar me from completing the course I had designed. It would&#10;seem, gentlemen, if I may put the thing clearly and briefly,&#10;that&#8212;Man has lived in vain.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The students glanced at one another. Had they heard aright? Mad?&#10;Raised eyebrows and grinning lips there were, but one or two faces&#10;remained intent upon his calm grey-fringed face. &#34;It will be&#10;interesting,&#34; he was saying, &#34;to devote this morning to an&#10;exposition, so far as I can make it clear to you, of the&#10;calculations that have led me to this conclusion. Let us&#10;assume&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He turned towards the blackboard, meditating a diagram in the&#10;way that was usual to him. &#34;What was that about &#39;lived in vain?&#39;&#34;&#10;whispered one student to another. &#34;Listen,&#34; said the other, nodding&#10;towards the lecturer.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And presently they began to understand.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;That night the star rose later, for its proper eastward motion&#10;had carried it some wayacross Leo towards&#10;Virgo, and its brightness was so great that the sky became a&#10;luminous blue as it rose, and every star was hidden in its turn,&#10;save only Jupiter near the zenith, Capella, Aldebaran, Sirius and&#10;the pointers of the Bear. It was very white and beautiful. In many&#10;parts of the world that night a pallid halo encircled it about. It&#10;was perceptibly larger; in the clear refractive sky of the tropics&#10;it seemed as if it were nearly a quarter the size of the moon. The&#10;frost was still on the ground in England, but the world was as&#10;brightly lit as if it were midsummer moonlight. One could see to&#10;read quite ordinary print by that cold clear light, and in the&#10;cities the lamps burnt yellow and wan.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And everywhere the world was awake that night, and throughout&#10;Christendom a sombre murmur hung in the keen air over the&#10;countryside like the belling of bees in the heather, and this&#10;murmurous tumult grew to a clangour in the cities. It was the&#10;tolling of the bells in a million belfry towers and steeples,&#10;summoning the people to sleep no more, to sin no more, but to&#10;gather in their churches and pray. And overhead, growing larger and&#10;brighter, as the earth rolled on its way and the night passed, rose&#10;the dazzling star. &#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And the streets and houses were alight in all the cities, the&#10;shipyards glared, and whatever roads led to high country were lit&#10;and crowded all night long. And in all the seas about the civilised&#10;lands, ships with throbbing engines, and ships with bellying sails,&#10;crowded with men and living creatures, were standing out to ocean&#10;and the north. For already the warning of the master mathematician&#10;had been telegraphed all over the world, and translated into a&#10;hundred tongues. The new planet and Neptune, locked in a fiery&#10;embrace, were whirling headlong, ever faster and faster towards the&#10;sun. Already every second this blazing mass flew a hundred miles,&#10;and every second its terrific velocity increased. As it flew now,&#10;indeed, it must pass a hundred million of miles wide of the earth&#10;and scarcely affect it. But near its destined path, as yet only&#10;slightly perturbed, spun the mighty planet Jupiter and his moons&#10;sweeping splendid round the sun. Every moment now the attraction&#10;between the fiery star and the greatest of the planets grew&#10;stronger. And the result of that attraction? Inevitably Jupiter&#10;would be deflected from its orbit into an elliptical path, and the&#10;burning star, swung by his attraction wide of its sunward rush,&#10;would &#34;describe a curved path&#34; andperhaps&#10;collide with, and certainly pass very close to, our earth.&#10;&#34;Earthquakes, volcanic outbreaks, cyclones, sea waves, floods, and&#10;a steady rise in temperature to I know not what limit&#34;&#8212;so&#10;prophesied the master mathematician.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And overhead, to carry out his words, lonely and cold and livid,&#10;blazed the star of the coming doom.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;To many who stared at it that night until their eyes ached, it&#10;seemed that it was visibly approaching. And that night, too, the&#10;weather changed, and the frost that had gripped all Central Europe&#10;and France and England softened towards a thaw.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But you must not imagine because I have spoken of people praying&#10;through the night and people going aboard ships and people fleeing&#10;towards mountainous country that the whole world was already in a&#10;terror because of the star. As a matter of fact, use and wont still&#10;ruled the world, and save for the talk of idle moments and the&#10;splendour of the night, nine human beings out of ten were still&#10;busy at their common occupations. In all the cities the shops, save&#10;one here and there, opened and closed at their proper hours, the&#10;doctor and the undertaker plied their trades, the workers&#10;gatheredin the factories, soldiers&#10;drilled, scholars studied, lovers sought one another, thieves&#10;lurked and fled, politicians planned their schemes. The presses of&#10;the newspapers roared through the nights, and many a priest of this&#10;church and that would not open his holy building to further what he&#10;considered a foolish panic. The newspapers insisted on the lesson&#10;of the year 1000&#8212;for then, too, people had anticipated the end. The&#10;star was no star&#8212;mere gas&#8212;a comet; and were it a star it could not&#10;possibly strike the earth. There was no precedent for such a thing.&#10;Common sense was sturdy everywhere, scornful, jesting, a little&#10;inclined to persecute the obdurate fearful. That night, at&#10;seven-fifteen by Greenwich time, the star would be at its nearest&#10;to Jupiter. Then the world would see the turn things would take.&#10;The master mathematician&#39;s grim warnings were treated by many as so&#10;much mere elaborate self-advertisement. Common sense at last, a&#10;little heated by argument, signified its unalterable convictions by&#10;going to bed. So, too, barbarism and savagery, already tired of the&#10;novelty, went about their nightly business, and save for a howling&#10;dog here and there, the beast world left the star unheeded.&#60;a id=&#34;Page_50&#34;&#62;&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And yet, when at last the watchers in the European States saw&#10;the star rise, an hour later it is true, but no larger than it had&#10;been the night before, there were still plenty awake to laugh at&#10;the master mathematician&#8212;to take the danger as if it had&#10;passed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But hereafter the laughter ceased. The star grew&#8212;it grew with a&#10;terrible steadiness hour after hour, a little larger each hour, a&#10;little nearer the midnight zenith, and brighter and brighter, until&#10;it had turned night into a second day. Had it come straight to the&#10;earth instead of in a curved path, had it lost no velocity to&#10;Jupiter, it must have leapt the intervening gulf in a day, but as&#10;it was it took five days altogether to come by our planet. The next&#10;night it had become a third the size of the moon before it set to&#10;English eyes, and the thaw was assured. It rose over America near&#10;the size of the moon, but blinding white to look at,&#10;and &#60;em&#62;hot&#60;/em&#62;; and a breath of hot wind blew now with its&#10;rising and gathering strength, and in Virginia, and Brazil, and&#10;down the St. Lawrence valley, it shone intermittently through a&#10;driving reek of thunder-clouds, flickering violet lightning, and&#10;hail unprecedented. In Manitoba was a thaw and devastating floods.&#10;And upon all the mountains of the earth the snow&#60;a id=&#34;Page_51&#34;&#62;&#60;/a&#62; and ice began to melt that night, and all the&#10;rivers coming out of high country flowed thick and turbid, and&#10;soon&#8212;in their upper reaches&#8212;with swirling trees and the bodies of&#10;beasts and men. They rose steadily, steadily in the ghostly&#10;brilliance, and came trickling over their banks at last, behind the&#10;flying population of their valleys.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And along the coast of Argentina and up the South Atlantic the&#10;tides were higher than had ever been in the memory of man, and the&#10;storms drove the waters in many cases scores of miles inland,&#10;drowning whole cities. And so great grew the heat during the night&#10;that the rising of the sun was like the coming of a shadow. The&#10;earthquakes began and grew until all down America from the Arctic&#10;Circle to Cape Horn, hillsides were sliding, fissures were opening,&#10;and houses and walls crumbling to destruction. The whole side of&#10;Cotopaxi slipped out in one vast convulsion, and a tumult of lava&#10;poured out so high and broad and swift and liquid that in one day&#10;it reached the sea.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So the star, with the wan moon in its wake, marched across the&#10;Pacific, trailed the thunderstorms like the hem of a robe, and the&#10;growing tidal wave that toiled behind it, frothing and eager,&#10;poured over island and island and swept&#60;a id=&#34;Page_52&#34;&#62;&#60;/a&#62; them clear of men. Until that wave came at&#10;last&#8212;in a blinding light and with the breath of a furnace, swift&#10;and terrible it came&#8212;a wall of water, fifty feet high, roaring&#10;hungrily, upon the long coasts of Asia, and swept inland across the&#10;plains of China. For a space the star, hotter now and larger and&#10;brighter than the sun in its strength, showed with pitiless&#10;brilliance the wide and populous country; towns and villages with&#10;their pagodas and trees, roads, wide cultivated fields, millions of&#10;sleepless people staring in helpless terror at the incandescent&#10;sky; and then, low and growing, came the murmur of the flood. And&#10;thus it was with millions of men that night&#8212;a flight nowhither,&#10;with limbs heavy with heat and breath fierce and scant, and the&#10;flood like a wall swift and white behind. And then death.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;China was lit glowing white, but over Japan and Java and all the&#10;islands of Eastern Asia the great star was a ball of dull red fire&#10;because of the steam and smoke and ashes the volcanoes were&#10;spouting forth to salute its coming. Above was the lava, hot gases&#10;and ash, and below the seething floods, and the whole earth swayed&#10;and rumbled with the earthquake shocks. Soon the immemorial snows&#10;of Thibet and the Himalaya were melting and pouring&#60;a id=&#34;Page_53&#34;&#62;&#60;/a&#62; down by ten million deepening converging&#10;channels upon the plains of Burmah and Hindostan. The tangled&#10;summits of the Indian jungles were aflame in a thousand places, and&#10;below the hurrying waters around the stems were dark objects that&#10;still struggled feebly and reflected the blood-red tongues of fire.&#10;And in a rudderless confusion a multitude of men and women fled&#10;down the broad river-ways to that one last hope of men&#8212;the open&#10;sea.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Larger grew the star, and larger, hotter, and brighter with a&#10;terrible swiftness now. The tropical ocean had lost its&#10;phosphorescence, and the whirling steam rose in ghostly wreaths&#10;from the black waves that plunged incessantly, speckled with&#10;storm-tossed ships.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And then came a wonder. It seemed to those who in Europe watched&#10;for the rising of the star that the world must have ceased its&#10;rotation. In a thousand open spaces of down and upland the people&#10;who had fled thither from the floods and the falling houses and&#10;sliding slopes of hill watched for that rising in vain. Hour&#10;followed hour through a terrible suspense, and the star rose not.&#10;Once again men set their eyes upon the old constellations they had&#10;counted lost to them forever. In England it was hot and clear&#10;overhead, though theground quivered&#10;perpetually, but in the tropics, Sirius and Capella and Aldebaran&#10;showed through a veil of steam. And when at last the great star&#10;rose near ten hours late, the sun rose close upon it, and in the&#10;centre of its white heart was a disc of black.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Over Asia it was the star had begun to fall behind the movement&#10;of the sky, and then suddenly, as it hung over India, its light had&#10;been veiled. All the plain of India from the mouth of the Indus to&#10;the mouths of the Ganges was a shallow waste of shining water that&#10;night, out of which rose temples and palaces, mounds and hills,&#10;black with people. Every minaret was a clustering mass of people,&#10;who fell one by one into the turbid waters, as heat and terror&#10;overcame them. The whole land seemed a-wailing, and suddenly there&#10;swept a shadow across that furnace of despair, and a breath of cold&#10;wind, and a gathering of clouds, out of the cooling air. Men&#10;looking up, near blinded, at the star, saw that a black disc was&#10;creeping across the light. It was the moon, coming between the star&#10;and the earth. And even as men cried to God at this respite, out of&#10;the East with a strange inexplicable swiftness sprang the sun. And&#10;then star, sun and moon rushed together across the heavens.&#60;a id=&#34;Page_55&#34;&#62;&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So it was that presently, to the European watchers, star and sun&#10;rose close upon each other, drove headlong for a space and then&#10;slower, and at last came to rest, star and sun merged into one&#10;glare of flame at the zenith of the sky. The moon no longer&#10;eclipsed the star but was lost to sight in the brilliance of the&#10;sky. And though those who were still alive regarded it for the most&#10;part with that dull stupidity that hunger, fatigue, heat and&#10;despair engender, there were still men who could perceive the&#10;meaning of these signs. Star and earth had been at their nearest,&#10;had swung about one another, and the star had passed. Already it&#10;was receding, swifter and swifter, in the last stage of its&#10;headlong journey downward into the sun.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And then the clouds gathered, blotting out the vision of the&#10;sky, the thunder and lightning wove a garment round the world; all&#10;over the earth was such a downpour of rain as men had never before&#10;seen, and where the volcanoes flared red against the cloud canopy&#10;there descended torrents of mud. Everywhere the waters were pouring&#10;off the land, leaving mud-silted ruins, and the earth littered like&#10;a storm-worn beach with all that had floated, and the dead bodies&#10;of the men and brutes, its children.For&#10;days the water streamed off the land, sweeping away soil and trees&#10;and houses in the way, and piling huge dykes and scooping out&#10;Titanic gullies over the country side. Those were the days of&#10;darkness that followed the star and the heat. All through them, and&#10;for many weeks and months, the earthquakes continued.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But the star had passed, and men, hunger-driven and gathering&#10;courage only slowly, might creep back to their ruined cities,&#10;buried granaries, and sodden fields. Such few ships as had escaped&#10;the storms of that time came stunned and shattered and sounding&#10;their way cautiously through the new marks and shoals of once&#10;familiar ports. And as the storms subsided men perceived that&#10;everywhere the days were hotter than of yore, and the sun larger,&#10;and the moon, shrunk to a third of its former size, took now&#10;fourscore days between its new and new.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But of the new brotherhood that grew presently among men, of the&#10;saving of laws and books and machines, of the strange change that&#10;had come over Iceland and Greenland and the shores of Baffin&#39;s Bay,&#10;so that the sailors coming there presently found them green and&#10;gracious, and could scarce believe their eyes, this&#60;a id=&#34;Page_57&#34;&#62;&#60;/a&#62; story does not tell. Nor of the movement of&#10;mankind now that the earth was hotter, northward and southward&#10;towards the poles of the earth. It concerns itself only with the&#10;coming and the passing of the Star.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Martian astronomers&#8212;for there are astronomers on Mars,&#10;although they are very different beings from men&#8212;were naturally&#10;profoundly interested by these things. They saw them from their own&#10;standpoint of course. &#34;Considering the mass and temperature of the&#10;missile that was flung through our solar system into the sun,&#34; one&#10;wrote, &#34;it is astonishing what a little damage the earth, which it&#10;missed so narrowly, has sustained. All the familiar continental&#10;markings and the masses of the seas remain intact, and indeed the&#10;only difference seems to be a shrinkage of the white discolouration&#10;(supposed to be frozen water) round either pole.&#34; Which only shows&#10;how small the vastest of human catastrophes may seem, at a distance&#10;of a few million miles.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 7, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/3469', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('The Man Who Could Do Miracles'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;It is doubtful whether the gift was innate. For my own&#10;part, I think it came to him suddenly. Indeed, until he was thirty&#10;he was a sceptic, and did not believe in miraculous powers. And&#10;here, since it is the most convenient place, I must mention that he&#10;was a little man, and had eyes of a hot brown, very erect red hair,&#10;a moustache with ends that he twisted up, and freckles. His name&#10;was George McWhirter Fotheringay&#8212;not the sort of name by any means&#10;to lead to any expectation of miracles&#8212;and he was clerk at&#10;Gomshott&#39;s. He was greatly addicted to assertive argument. It was&#10;while he was asserting the impossibility of miracles that he had&#10;his first intimation of his extraordinary powers. This particular&#10;argument was being held in the bar of the Long Dragon, and Toddy&#10;Beamish was conducting the opposition by a monotonous but effective&#10;&#34;So &#60;em&#62;you&#60;/em&#62; say,&#34;that&#10;drove Mr. Fotheringay to the very limit of his patience.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There were present, besides these two, a very dusty cyclist,&#10;landlord Cox, and Miss Maybridge, the perfectly respectable and&#10;rather portly barmaid of the Dragon. Miss Maybridge was standing&#10;with her back to Mr. Fotheringay, washing glasses; the others were&#10;watching him, more or less amused by the present ineffectiveness of&#10;the assertive method. Goaded by the Torres Vedras tactics of Mr.&#10;Beamish, Mr. Fotheringay determined to make an unusual rhetorical&#10;effort. &#34;Looky here, Mr. Beamish,&#34; said Mr. Fotheringay. &#34;Let us&#10;clearly understand what a miracle is. It&#39;s something contrariwise&#10;to the course of nature done by power of Will, something what&#10;couldn&#39;t happen without being specially willed.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;So &#60;em&#62;you&#60;/em&#62; say,&#34; said Mr. Beamish, repulsing&#10;him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Fotheringay appealed to the cyclist, who had hitherto been a&#10;silent auditor, and received his assent&#8212;given with a hesitating&#10;cough and a glance at Mr. Beamish. The landlord would express no&#10;opinion, and Mr. Fotheringay, returning to Mr. Beamish, received&#10;the unexpected concession of a qualified assent to his definition&#10;of a miracle. &#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;For instance,&#34; said Mr. Fotheringay, greatly encouraged. &#34;Here&#10;would be a miracle. That lamp, in the natural course of nature,&#10;couldn&#39;t burn like that upsy-down, could it, Beamish?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;&#60;em&#62;You&#60;/em&#62; say it couldn&#39;t,&#34; said Beamish.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And you?&#34; said Fotheringay. &#34;You don&#39;t mean to say&#8212;eh?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No,&#34; said Beamish reluctantly. &#34;No, it couldn&#39;t.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Very well,&#34; said Mr. Fotheringay. &#34;Then here comes someone, as&#10;it might be me, along here, and stands as it might be here, and&#10;says to that lamp, as I might do, collecting all my will&#8212;Turn&#10;upsy-down without breaking, and go on burning steady,&#10;and&#8212;Hullo!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was enough to make anyone say &#34;Hullo!&#34; The impossible, the&#10;incredible, was visible to them all. The lamp hung inverted in the&#10;air, burning quietly with its flame pointing down. It was as solid,&#10;as indisputable as ever a lamp was, the prosaic common lamp of the&#10;Long Dragon bar.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Fotheringay stood with an extended forefinger and the&#10;knitted brows of one anticipating a catastrophic smash. The&#10;cyclist, who was sitting next the lamp, ducked and jumped across&#10;the bar. Everybody jumped, more orless.&#10;Miss Maybridge turned and screamed. For nearly three seconds the&#10;lamp remained still. A faint cry of mental distress came from Mr.&#10;Fotheringay. &#34;I can&#39;t keep it up,&#34; he said, &#34;any longer.&#34; He&#10;staggered back, and the inverted lamp suddenly flared, fell against&#10;the corner of the bar, bounced aside, smashed upon the floor, and&#10;went out.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was lucky it had a metal receiver, or the whole place would&#10;have been in a blaze. Mr. Cox was the first to speak, and his&#10;remark, shorn of needless excrescences, was to the effect that&#10;Fotheringay was a fool. Fotheringay was beyond disputing even so&#10;fundamental a proposition as that! He was astonished beyond measure&#10;at the thing that had occurred. The subsequent conversation threw&#10;absolutely no light on the matter so far as Fotheringay was&#10;concerned; the general opinion not only followed Mr. Cox very&#10;closely but very vehemently. Everyone accused Fotheringay of a&#10;silly trick, and presented him to himself as a foolish destroyer of&#10;comfort and security. His mind was in a tornado of perplexity, he&#10;was himself inclined to agree with them, and he made a remarkably&#10;ineffectual opposition to the proposal of his departure.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He went home flushed and heated, coat-collar&#60;a id=&#34;Page_331&#34;&#62;&#60;/a&#62; crumpled, eyes smarting and ears red. He&#10;watched each of the ten street lamps nervously as he passed it. It&#10;was only when he found himself alone in his little bed-room in&#10;Church Row that he was able to grapple seriously with his memories&#10;of the occurrence, and ask, &#34;What on earth happened?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He had removed his coat and boots, and was sitting on the bed&#10;with his hands in his pockets repeating the text of his defence for&#10;the seventeenth time, &#34;&#60;em&#62;I&#60;/em&#62; didn&#39;t want the confounded&#10;thing to upset,&#34; when it occurred to him that at the precise moment&#10;he had said the commanding words he had inadvertently willed the&#10;thing he said, and that when he had seen the lamp in the air he had&#10;felt that it depended on him to maintain it there without being&#10;clear how this was to be done. He had not a particularly complex&#10;mind, or he might have stuck for a time at that &#34;inadvertently&#10;willed,&#34; embracing, as it does, the abstrusest problems of&#10;voluntary action; but as it was, the idea came to him with a quite&#10;acceptable haziness. And from that, following, as I must admit, no&#10;clear logical path, he came to the test of experiment.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He pointed resolutely to his candle and collected his mind,&#10;though he felt he did a foolish thing. &#34;Be raised up,&#34; he said. But&#10;in a secondthat feeling vanished. The&#10;candle was raised, hung in the air one giddy moment, and as Mr.&#10;Fotheringay gasped, fell with a smash on his toilet-table, leaving&#10;him in darkness save for the expiring glow of its wick.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For a time Mr. Fotheringay sat in the darkness, perfectly still.&#10;&#34;It did happen, after all,&#34; he said. &#34;And&#10;&#39;ow &#60;em&#62;I&#39;m&#60;/em&#62; to explain it&#10;I &#60;em&#62;don&#39;t&#60;/em&#62;know.&#34; He sighed heavily, and began feeling in&#10;his pockets for a match. He could find none, and he rose and groped&#10;about the toilet-table. &#34;I wish I had a match,&#34; he said. He&#10;resorted to his coat, and there was none there, and then it dawned&#10;upon him that miracles were possible even with matches. He extended&#10;a hand and scowled at it in the dark. &#34;Let there be a match in that&#10;hand,&#34; he said. He felt some light object fall across his palm, and&#10;his fingers closed upon a match.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;After several ineffectual attempts to light this, he discovered&#10;it was a safety-match. He threw it down, and then it occurred to&#10;him that he might have willed it lit. He did, and perceived it&#10;burning in the midst of his toilet-table mat. He caught it up&#10;hastily, and it went out. His perception of possibilities enlarged,&#10;and he felt for and replaced the candle in its candlestick.&#10;&#34;Here! &#60;em&#62;you&#60;/em&#62; be lit,&#34; said Mr. Fotheringay,&#60;a id=&#34;Page_333&#34;&#62;&#60;/a&#62; and forthwith the candle was flaring, and he&#10;saw a little black hole in the toilet-cover, with a wisp of smoke&#10;rising from it. For a time he stared from this to the little flame&#10;and back, and then looked up and met his own gaze in the looking&#10;glass. By this help he communed with himself in silence for a&#10;time.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;How about miracles now?&#34; said Mr. Fotheringay at last,&#10;addressing his reflection.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The subsequent meditations of Mr. Fotheringay were of a severe&#10;but confused description. So far, he could see it was a case of&#10;pure willing with him. The nature of his experiences so far&#10;disinclined him for any further experiments, at least until he had&#10;reconsidered them. But he lifted a sheet of paper, and turned a&#10;glass of water pink and then green, and he created a snail, which&#10;he miraculously annihilated, and got himself a miraculous new&#10;tooth-brush. Somewhen in the small hours he had reached the fact&#10;that his will-power must be of a particularly rare and pungent&#10;quality, a fact of which he had certainly had inklings before, but&#10;no certain assurance. The scare and perplexity of his first&#10;discovery was now qualified by pride in this evidence of&#10;singularity and by vague intimations of advantage. He became aware&#10;that the church clock was striking one, and as it did&#60;a id=&#34;Page_334&#34;&#62;&#60;/a&#62; not occur to him that his daily duties at&#10;Gomshott&#39;s might be miraculously dispensed with, he resumed&#10;undressing, in order to get to bed without further delay. As he&#10;struggled to get his shirt over his head, he was struck with a&#10;brilliant idea. &#34;Let me be in bed,&#34; he said, and found himself so.&#10;&#34;Undressed,&#34; he stipulated; and, finding the sheets cold, added&#10;hastily, &#34;and in my nightshirt&#8212;no, in a nice soft woollen&#10;nightshirt. Ah!&#34; he said with immense enjoyment. &#34;And now let me be&#10;comfortably asleep&#8230; .&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He awoke at his usual hour and was pensive all through&#10;breakfast-time, wondering whether his overnight experience might&#10;not be a particularly vivid dream. At length his mind turned again&#10;to cautious experiments. For instance, he had three eggs for&#10;breakfast; two his landlady had supplied, good, but shoppy, and one&#10;was a delicious fresh goose-egg, laid, cooked, and served by his&#10;extraordinary will. He hurried off to Gomshott&#39;s in a state of&#10;profound but carefully concealed excitement, and only remembered&#10;the shell of the third egg when his landlady spoke of it that&#10;night. All day he could do no work because of this astonishingly&#10;new self-knowledge, but this caused him no inconvenience,&#60;a id=&#34;Page_335&#34;&#62;&#60;/a&#62; because he made up for it miraculously in his&#10;last ten minutes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As the day wore on his state of mind passed from wonder to&#10;elation, albeit the circumstances of his dismissal from the Long&#10;Dragon were still disagreeable to recall, and a garbled account of&#10;the matter that had reached his colleagues led to some badinage. It&#10;was evident he must be careful how he lifted frangible articles,&#10;but in other ways his gift promised more and more as he turned it&#10;over in his mind. He intended among other things to increase his&#10;personal property by unostentatious acts of creation. He called&#10;into existence a pair of very splendid diamond studs, and hastily&#10;annihilated them again as young Gomshott came across the&#10;counting-house to his desk. He was afraid young Gomshott might&#10;wonder how he had come by them. He saw quite clearly the gift&#10;required caution and watchfulness in its exercise, but so far as he&#10;could judge the difficulties attending its mastery would be no&#10;greater than those he had already faced in the study of cycling. It&#10;was that analogy, perhaps, quite as much as the feeling that he&#10;would be unwelcome in the Long Dragon, that drove him out after&#10;supper into the lane beyond the gas-works, to rehearse a few&#10;miracles in private. &#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There was possibly a certain want of originality in his&#10;attempts, for apart from his will-power Mr. Fotheringay was not a&#10;very exceptional man. The miracle of Moses&#39; rod came to his mind,&#10;but the night was dark and unfavourable to the proper control of&#10;large miraculous snakes. Then he recollected the story of&#10;&#34;Tannh&#228;user&#34; that he had read on the back of the Philharmonic&#10;programme. That seemed to him singularly attractive and harmless.&#10;He stuck his walking-stick&#8212;a very nice Poona-Penang lawyer&#8212;into the&#10;turf that edged the footpath, and commanded the dry wood to&#10;blossom. The air was immediately full of the scent of roses, and by&#10;means of a match he saw for himself that this beautiful miracle was&#10;indeed accomplished. His satisfaction was ended by advancing&#10;footsteps. Afraid of a premature discovery of his powers, he&#10;addressed the blossoming stick hastily: &#34;Go back.&#34; What he meant&#10;was &#34;Change back;&#34; but of course he was confused. The stick receded&#10;at a considerable velocity, and incontinently came a cry of anger&#10;and a bad word from the approaching person. &#34;Who are you throwing&#10;brambles at, you fool?&#34; cried a voice. &#34;That got me on the&#10;shin.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I&#39;m sorry, old chap,&#34; said Mr. Fotheringay, and then realising&#10;the awkward nature of theexplanation,&#10;caught nervously at his moustache. He saw Winch, one of the three&#10;Immering constables, advancing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What d&#39;yer mean by it?&#34; asked the constable. &#34;Hullo! It&#39;s you,&#10;is it? The gent that broke the lamp at the Long Dragon!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I don&#39;t mean anything by it,&#34; said Mr. Fotheringay. &#34;Nothing at&#10;all.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What d&#39;yer do it for then?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh, bother!&#34; said Mr. Fotheringay.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Bother indeed! D&#39;yer know that stick hurt? What d&#39;yer do it&#10;for, eh?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For the moment Mr. Fotheringay could not think what he had done&#10;it for. His silence seemed to irritate Mr. Winch. &#34;You&#39;ve been&#10;assaulting the police, young man, this time. That&#39;s&#10;what &#60;em&#62;you&#60;/em&#62; done.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Look here, Mr. Winch,&#34; said Mr. Fotheringay, annoyed and&#10;confused, &#34;I&#39;m very sorry. The fact is&#8212;&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He could think of no way but the truth. &#34;I was working a&#10;miracle.&#34; He tried to speak in an off-hand way, but try as he would&#10;he couldn&#39;t.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Working a&#8212;&#8212;! &#39;Ere, don&#39;t you talk rot. Working a miracle,&#10;indeed! Miracle! Well, that&#39;s downright funny! Why, you&#39;s the&#10;chap that don&#39;t believe in miracles&#8230; . Fact is,&#10;this is another of your silly conjuring tricks&#8212;that&#39;s what this is.&#10;Now, I tell you&#8212;&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But Mr. Fotheringay never heard what Mr. Winch was going to tell&#10;him. He realised he had given himself away, flung his valuable&#10;secret to all the winds of heaven. A violent gust of irritation&#10;swept him to action. He turned on the constable swiftly and&#10;fiercely. &#34;Here,&#34; he said, &#34;I&#39;ve had enough of this, I have! I&#39;ll&#10;show you a silly conjuring trick, I will! Go to Hades! Go,&#10;now!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He was alone!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Fotheringay performed no more miracles that night, nor did&#10;he trouble to see what had become of his flowering stick. He&#10;returned to the town, scared and very quiet, and went to his&#10;bed-room. &#34;Lord!&#34; he said, &#34;it&#39;s a powerful gift&#8212;an extremely&#10;powerful gift. I didn&#39;t hardly mean as much as that. Not really&#8230; .&#10;I wonder what Hades is like!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He sat on the bed taking off his boots. Struck by a happy&#10;thought he transferred the constable to San Francisco, and without&#10;any more interference with normal causation went soberly to bed. In&#10;the night he dreamt of the anger of Winch.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The next day Mr. Fotheringay heard two&#60;a id=&#34;Page_339&#34;&#62;&#60;/a&#62; interesting items of news. Someone had planted&#10;a most beautiful climbing rose against the elder Mr. Gomshott&#39;s&#10;private house in the Lullaborough Road, and the river as far as&#10;Rawling&#39;s Mill was to be dragged for Constable Winch.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Fotheringay was abstracted and thoughtful all that day, and&#10;performed no miracles except certain provisions for Winch, and the&#10;miracle of completing his day&#39;s work with punctual perfection in&#10;spite of all the bee-swarm of thoughts that hummed through his&#10;mind. And the extraordinary abstraction and meekness of his manner&#10;was remarked by several people, and made a matter for jesting. For&#10;the most part he was thinking of Winch.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;On Sunday evening he went to chapel, and oddly enough, Mr.&#10;Maydig, who took a certain interest in occult matters, preached&#10;about &#34;things that are not lawful.&#34; Mr. Fotheringay was not a&#10;regular chapel goer, but the system of assertive scepticism, to&#10;which I have already alluded, was now very much shaken. The tenor&#10;of the sermon threw an entirely new light on these novel gifts, and&#10;he suddenly decided to consult Mr. Maydig immediately after the&#10;service. So soon as that was determined, he&#60;a id=&#34;Page_340&#34;&#62;&#60;/a&#62; found himself wondering why he had not done so&#10;before.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Maydig, a lean, excitable man with quite remarkably long&#10;wrists and neck, was gratified at a request for a private&#10;conversation from a young man whose carelessness in religious&#10;matters was a subject for general remark in the town. After a few&#10;necessary delays, he conducted him to the study of the Manse, which&#10;was contiguous to the chapel, seated him comfortably, and, standing&#10;in front of a cheerful fire&#8212;his legs threw a Rhodian arch of shadow&#10;on the opposite wall&#8212;requested Mr. Fotheringay to state his&#10;business.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At first Mr. Fotheringay was a little abashed, and found some&#10;difficulty in opening the matter. &#34;You will scarcely believe me,&#10;Mr. Maydig, I am afraid&#34;&#8212;and so forth for some time. He tried a&#10;question at last, and asked Mr. Maydig his opinion of miracles.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Maydig was still saying &#34;Well&#34; in an extremely judicial&#10;tone, when Mr. Fotheringay interrupted again: &#34;You don&#39;t believe, I&#10;suppose, that some common sort of person&#8212;like myself, for&#10;instance&#8212;as it might be sitting here now, might have some sort of&#10;twist inside him that made him able to do things by his&#10;will.&#34; &#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It&#39;s possible,&#34; said Mr. Maydig. &#34;Something of the sort,&#10;perhaps, is possible.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;If I might make free with something here, I think I might show&#10;you by a sort of experiment,&#34; said Mr. Fotheringay. &#34;Now, take that&#10;tobacco-jar on the table, for instance. What I want to know is&#10;whether what I am going to do with it is a miracle or not. Just&#10;half a minute, Mr. Maydig, please.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He knitted his brows, pointed to the tobacco-jar and said: &#34;Be a&#10;bowl of vi&#39;lets.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The tobacco-jar did as it was ordered.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Maydig started violently at the change, and stood looking&#10;from the thaumaturgist to the bowl of flowers. He said nothing.&#10;Presently he ventured to lean over the table and smell the violets;&#10;they were fresh-picked and very fine ones. Then he stared at Mr.&#10;Fotheringay again.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;How did you do that?&#34; he asked.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Fotheringay pulled his moustache. &#34;Just told it&#8212;and there&#10;you are. Is that a miracle, or is it black art, or what is it? And&#10;what do you think&#39;s the matter with me? That&#39;s what I want to&#10;ask.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It&#39;s a most extraordinary occurrence.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And this day last week I knew no more that I could do things&#10;like that than you did. Itcame quite&#10;sudden. It&#39;s something odd about my will, I suppose, and that&#39;s as&#10;far as I can see.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Is &#60;em&#62;that&#60;/em&#62;&#8212;the only thing. Could you do other things&#10;besides that?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Lord, yes!&#34; said Mr. Fotheringay. &#34;Just anything.&#34; He thought,&#10;and suddenly recalled a conjuring entertainment he had seen.&#10;&#34;Here!&#34; He pointed. &#34;Change into a bowl of fish&#8212;no, not that&#8212;change&#10;into a glass bowl full of water with goldfish swimming in it.&#10;That&#39;s better! You see that, Mr. Maydig?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It&#39;s astonishing. It&#39;s incredible. You are either a most&#10;extraordinary &#8230; But no&#8212;&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I could change it into anything,&#34; said Mr. Fotheringay. &#34;Just&#10;anything. Here! be a pigeon, will you?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In another moment a blue pigeon was fluttering round the room&#10;and making Mr. Maydig duck every time it came near him. &#34;Stop&#10;there, will you,&#34; said Mr. Fotheringay; and the pigeon hung&#10;motionless in the air. &#34;I could change it back to a bowl of&#10;flowers,&#34; he said, and after replacing the pigeon on the table&#10;worked that miracle. &#34;I expect you will want your pipe in a bit,&#34;&#10;he said, and restored the tobacco-jar. &#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Maydig had followed all these later changes in a sort of&#10;ejaculatory silence. He stared at Mr. Fotheringay and, in a very&#10;gingerly manner, picked up the tobacco-jar, examined it, replaced&#10;it on the table. &#34;&#60;em&#62;Well!&#60;/em&#62;&#34; was the only expression of his&#10;feelings.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Now, after that it&#39;s easier to explain what I came about,&#34; said&#10;Mr. Fotheringay; and proceeded to a lengthy and involved narrative&#10;of his strange experiences, beginning with the affair of the lamp&#10;in the Long Dragon and complicated by persistent allusions to&#10;Winch. As he went on, the transient pride Mr. Maydig&#39;s&#10;consternation had caused passed away; he became the very ordinary&#10;Mr. Fotheringay of everyday intercourse again. Mr. Maydig listened&#10;intently, the tobacco-jar in his hand, and his bearing changed also&#10;with the course of the narrative. Presently, while Mr. Fotheringay&#10;was dealing with the miracle of the third egg, the minister&#10;interrupted with a fluttering extended hand&#8212;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It is possible,&#34; he said. &#34;It is credible. It is amazing, of&#10;course, but it reconciles a number of amazing difficulties. The&#10;power to work miracles is a gift&#8212;a peculiar quality like genius or&#10;second sight&#8212;hitherto it has come very rarely and to exceptional&#10;people. But in thiscase &#8230; I have&#10;always wondered at the miracles of Mahomet, and at Yogi&#39;s miracles,&#10;and the miracles of Madame Blavatsky. But, of course! Yes, it is&#10;simply a gift! It carries out so beautifully the arguments of that&#10;great thinker&#34;&#8212;Mr. Maydig&#39;s voice sank&#8212;&#34;his Grace the Duke of&#10;Argyll. Here we plumb some profounder law&#8212;deeper than the ordinary&#10;laws of nature. Yes&#8212;yes. Go on. Go on!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Fotheringay proceeded to tell of his misadventure with&#10;Winch, and Mr. Maydig, no longer overawed or scared, began to jerk&#10;his limbs about and interject astonishment. &#34;It&#39;s this what&#10;troubled me most,&#34; proceeded Mr. Fotheringay; &#34;it&#39;s this I&#39;m most&#10;mijitly in want of advice for; of course he&#39;s at San&#10;Francisco&#8212;wherever San Francisco may be&#8212;but of course it&#39;s awkward&#10;for both of us, as you&#39;ll see, Mr. Maydig. I don&#39;t see how he can&#10;understand what has happened, and I daresay he&#39;s scared and&#10;exasperated something tremendous, and trying to get at me. I&#10;daresay he keeps on starting off to come here. I send him back, by&#10;a miracle, every few hours, when I think of it. And of course,&#10;that&#39;s a thing he won&#39;t be able to understand, and it&#39;s bound to&#10;annoy him; and, of course, if he takesa&#10;ticket every time it will cost him a lot of money. I done the best&#10;I could for him, but of course it&#39;s difficult for him to put&#10;himself in my place. I thought afterwards that his clothes might&#10;have got scorched, you know&#8212;if Hades is all it&#39;s supposed to&#10;be&#8212;before I shifted him. In that case I suppose they&#39;d have locked&#10;him up in San Francisco. Of course I willed him a new suit of&#10;clothes on him directly I thought of it. But, you see, I&#39;m already&#10;in a deuce of a tangle&#8212;&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Maydig looked serious. &#34;I see you are in a tangle. Yes, it&#39;s&#10;a difficult position. How you are to end it &#8230; &#34; He became&#10;diffuse and inconclusive.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;However, we&#39;ll leave Winch for a little and discuss the larger&#10;question. I don&#39;t think this is a case of the black art or anything&#10;of the sort. I don&#39;t think there is any taint of criminality about&#10;it at all, Mr. Fotheringay&#8212;none whatever, unless you are&#10;suppressing material facts. No, it&#39;s miracles&#8212;pure&#10;miracles&#8212;miracles, if I may say so, of the very highest class.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He began to pace the hearthrug and gesticulate, while Mr.&#10;Fotheringay sat with his arm on the table and his head on his arm,&#10;looking worried. &#34;I don&#39;t see how I&#39;m to manage about Winch,&#34; he&#10;said. &#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;A gift of working miracles&#8212;apparently a very powerful gift,&#34;&#10;said Mr. Maydig, &#34;will find a way about Winch&#8212;never fear. My dear&#10;Sir, you are a most important man&#8212;a man of the most astonishing&#10;possibilities. As evidence, for example! And in other ways, the&#10;things you may do&#8230; .&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, &#60;em&#62;I&#39;ve&#60;/em&#62; thought of a thing or two,&#34; said&#10;Mr. Fotheringay. &#34;But&#8212;some of the things came a bit twisty. You saw&#10;that fish at first? Wrong sort of bowl and wrong sort of fish. And&#10;I thought I&#39;d ask someone.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;A proper course,&#34; said Mr. Maydig, &#34;a very proper&#10;course&#8212;altogether the proper course.&#34; He stopped and looked at Mr.&#10;Fotheringay. &#34;It&#39;s practically an unlimited gift. Let us test your&#10;powers, for instance. If they really &#60;em&#62;are&#60;/em&#62; &#8230; If&#10;they really are all they seem to be.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And so, incredible as it may seem, in the study of the little&#10;house behind the Congregational Chapel, on the evening of Sunday,&#10;Nov. 10, 1896, Mr. Fotheringay, egged on and inspired by Mr.&#10;Maydig, began to work miracles. The reader&#39;s attention is specially&#10;and definitely called to the date. He will object, probably has&#10;already objected, that certain points in this story are improbable,&#10;that if any things of the sort already described had indeed&#10;occurred,they would have been in all the&#10;papers a year ago. The details immediately following he will find&#10;particularly hard to accept, because among other things they&#10;involve the conclusion that he or she, the reader in question, must&#10;have been killed in a violent and unprecedented manner more than a&#10;year ago. Now a miracle is nothing if not improbable, and as a&#10;matter of fact the reader &#60;em&#62;was&#60;/em&#62; killed in a&#10;violent and unprecedented manner a year ago. In the subsequent&#10;course of this story that will become perfectly clear and credible,&#10;as every right-minded and reasonable reader will admit. But this is&#10;not the place for the end of the story, being but little beyond the&#10;hither side of the middle. And at first the miracles worked by Mr.&#10;Fotheringay were timid little miracles&#8212;little things with the cups&#10;and parlour fitments, as feeble as the miracles of Theosophists,&#10;and, feeble as they were, they were received with awe by his&#10;collaborator. He would have preferred to settle the Winch business&#10;out of hand, but Mr. Maydig would not let him. But after they had&#10;worked a dozen of these domestic trivialities, their sense of power&#10;grew, their imagination began to show signs of stimulation, and&#10;their ambition enlarged. Their first larger enterprise was due to&#10;hunger and the negligence of Mrs.&#60;a id=&#34;Page_348&#34;&#62;&#60;/a&#62; Minchin, Mr. Maydig&#39;s housekeeper. The meal to&#10;which the minister conducted Mr. Fotheringay was certainly ill-laid&#10;and uninviting as refreshment for two industrious miracle-workers;&#10;but they were seated, and Mr. Maydig was descanting in sorrow&#10;rather than in anger upon his housekeeper&#39;s shortcomings, before it&#10;occurred to Mr. Fotheringay that an opportunity lay before him.&#10;&#34;Don&#39;t you think, Mr. Maydig,&#34; he said, &#34;if it isn&#39;t a&#10;liberty, &#60;em&#62;I&#60;/em&#62;&#8212;&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My dear Mr. Fotheringay! Of course! No&#8212;I didn&#39;t think.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Fotheringay waved his hand. &#34;What shall we have?&#34; he said,&#10;in a large, inclusive spirit, and, at Mr. Maydig&#39;s order, revised&#10;the supper very thoroughly. &#34;As for me,&#34; he said, eyeing Mr.&#10;Maydig&#39;s selection, &#34;I am always particularly fond of a tankard of&#10;stout and a nice Welsh rarebit, and I&#39;ll order that. I ain&#39;t much&#10;given to Burgundy,&#34; and forthwith stout and Welsh rarebit promptly&#10;appeared at his command. They sat long at their supper, talking&#10;like equals, as Mr. Fotheringay presently perceived, with a glow of&#10;surprise and gratification, of all the miracles they would&#10;presently do. &#34;And, by the bye, Mr. Maydig,&#34; said Mr. Fotheringay,&#10;&#34;I might perhaps be able to help you&#8212;in a domestic way.&#34;&#60;a id=&#34;Page_349&#34;&#62;&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Don&#39;t quite follow,&#34; said Mr. Maydig pouring out a glass of&#10;miraculous old Burgundy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Fotheringay helped himself to a second Welsh rarebit out of&#10;vacancy, and took a mouthful. &#34;I was thinking,&#34; he said, &#34;I might&#10;be able (&#60;em&#62;chum, chum&#60;/em&#62;) to work (&#60;em&#62;chum, chum&#60;/em&#62;) a&#10;miracle with Mrs. Minchin (&#60;em&#62;chum, chum&#60;/em&#62;)&#8212;make her a better&#10;woman.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Maydig put down the glass and looked doubtful. &#34;She&#39;s&#8212;&#8212; She&#10;strongly objects to interference, you know, Mr. Fotheringay. And&#8212;as&#10;a matter of fact&#8212;it&#39;s well past eleven and she&#39;s probably in bed&#10;and asleep. Do you think, on the whole&#8212;&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Fotheringay considered these objections. &#34;I don&#39;t see that&#10;it shouldn&#39;t be done in her sleep.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For a time Mr. Maydig opposed the idea, and then he yielded. Mr.&#10;Fotheringay issued his orders, and a little less at their ease,&#10;perhaps, the two gentlemen proceeded with their repast. Mr. Maydig&#10;was enlarging on the changes he might expect in his housekeeper&#10;next day, with an optimism that seemed even to Mr. Fotheringay&#39;s&#10;supper senses a little forced and hectic, when a series of confused&#10;noises from upstairs began. Their eyes exchanged&#10;interrogations,and Mr. Maydig left the&#10;room hastily. Mr. Fotheringay heard him calling up to his&#10;housekeeper and then his footsteps going softly up to her.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In a minute or so the minister returned, his step light, his&#10;face radiant. &#34;Wonderful!&#34; he said, &#34;and touching! Most&#10;touching!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He began pacing the hearthrug. &#34;A repentance&#8212;a most touching&#10;repentance&#8212;through the crack of the door. Poor woman! A most&#10;wonderful change! She had got up. She must have got up at once. She&#10;had got up out of her sleep to smash a private bottle of brandy in&#10;her box. And to confess it too!&#8230; But this gives us&#8212;it opens&#8212;a most&#10;amazing vista of possibilities. If we can work this miraculous&#10;change in &#60;em&#62;her&#60;/em&#62; &#8230; &#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The thing&#39;s unlimited seemingly,&#34; said Mr. Fotheringay. &#34;And&#10;about Mr. Winch&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Altogether unlimited.&#34; And from the hearthrug Mr. Maydig,&#10;waving the Winch difficulty aside, unfolded a series of wonderful&#10;proposals&#8212;proposals he invented as he went along.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now what those proposals were does not concern the essentials of&#10;this story. Suffice it that they were designed in a spirit of&#10;infinite benevolence, the sort of benevolence that used to be&#60;a id=&#34;Page_351&#34;&#62;&#60;/a&#62; called post-prandial. Suffice it, too, that&#10;the problem of Winch remained unsolved. Nor is it necessary to&#10;describe how far that series got to its fulfilment. There were&#10;astonishing changes. The small hours found Mr. Maydig and Mr.&#10;Fotheringay careering across the chilly market-square under the&#10;still moon, in a sort of ecstasy of thaumaturgy, Mr. Maydig all&#10;flap and gesture, Mr. Fotheringay short and bristling, and no&#10;longer abashed at his greatness. They had reformed every drunkard&#10;in the Parliamentary division, changed all the beer and alcohol to&#10;water (Mr. Maydig had overruled Mr. Fotheringay on this point);&#10;they had, further, greatly improved the railway communication of&#10;the place, drained Flinder&#39;s swamp, improved the soil of One Tree&#10;Hill, and cured the Vicar&#39;s wart. And they were going to see what&#10;could be done with the injured pier at South Bridge. &#34;The place,&#34;&#10;gasped Mr. Maydig, &#34;won&#39;t be the same place to-morrow. How&#10;surprised and thankful everyone will be!&#34; And just at that moment&#10;the church clock struck three.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I say,&#34; said Mr. Fotheringay, &#34;that&#39;s three o&#39;clock! I must be&#10;getting back. I&#39;ve got to be at business by eight. And besides,&#10;Mrs. Wimms&#8212;&#34; &#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;We&#39;re only beginning,&#34; said Mr. Maydig, full of the sweetness&#10;of unlimited power. &#34;We&#39;re only beginning. Think of all the good&#10;we&#39;re doing. When people wake&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But&#8212;,&#34; said Mr. Fotheringay.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Maydig gripped his arm suddenly. His eyes were bright and&#10;wild. &#34;My dear chap,&#34; he said, &#34;there&#39;s no hurry. Look&#34;&#8212;he pointed&#10;to the moon at the zenith&#8212;&#34;Joshua!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Joshua?&#34; said Mr. Fotheringay.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Joshua,&#34; said Mr. Maydig. &#34;Why not? Stop it.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Fotheringay looked at the moon.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That&#39;s a bit tall,&#34; he said after a pause.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why not?&#34; said Mr. Maydig. &#34;Of course it doesn&#39;t stop. You stop&#10;the rotation of the earth, you know. Time stops. It isn&#39;t as if we&#10;were doing harm.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;H&#39;m!&#34; said Mr. Fotheringay. &#34;Well.&#34; He sighed. &#34;I&#39;ll try.&#10;Here&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He buttoned up his jacket and addressed himself to the habitable&#10;globe, with as good an assumption of confidence as lay in his&#10;power. &#34;Jest stop rotating, will you,&#34; said Mr. Fotheringay.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Incontinently he was flying head over heels through the air at&#10;the rate of dozens of miles a minute. In spite of the innumerable&#10;circles hewas describing per second, he&#10;thought; for thought is wonderful&#8212;sometimes as sluggish as flowing&#10;pitch, sometimes as instantaneous as light. He thought in a second,&#10;and willed. &#34;Let me come down safe and sound. Whatever else&#10;happens, let me down safe and sound.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He willed it only just in time, for his clothes, heated by his&#10;rapid flight through the air, were already beginning to singe. He&#10;came down with a forcible, but by no means injurious bump in what&#10;appeared to be a mound of fresh-turned earth. A large mass of metal&#10;and masonry, extraordinarily like the clock-tower in the middle of&#10;the market-square, hit the earth near him, ricochetted over him,&#10;and flew into stonework, bricks, and masonry, like a bursting bomb.&#10;A hurtling cow hit one of the larger blocks and smashed like an&#10;egg. There was a crash that made all the most violent crashes of&#10;his past life seem like the sound of falling dust, and this was&#10;followed by a descending series of lesser crashes. A vast wind&#10;roared throughout earth and heaven, so that he could scarcely lift&#10;his head to look. For a while he was too breathless and astonished&#10;even to see where he was or what had happened. And his first&#10;movement was to feel his headand&#10;reassure himself that his streaming hair was still his own.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Lord!&#34; gasped Mr. Fotheringay, scarce able to speak for the&#10;gale, &#34;I&#39;ve had a squeak! What&#39;s gone wrong? Storms and thunder.&#10;And only a minute ago a fine night. It&#39;s Maydig set me on to this&#10;sort of thing. &#60;em&#62;What&#60;/em&#62; a wind! If I go on fooling&#10;in this way I&#39;m bound to have a thundering accident!&#8230;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Where&#39;s Maydig?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What a confounded mess everything&#39;s in!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He looked about him so far as his flapping jacket would permit.&#10;The appearance of things was really extremely strange. &#34;The sky&#39;s&#10;all right anyhow,&#34; said Mr. Fotheringay. &#34;And that&#39;s about all that&#10;is all right. And even there it looks like a terrific gale coming&#10;up. But there&#39;s the moon overhead. Just as it was just now. Bright&#10;as midday. But as for the rest&#8212;Where&#39;s the village? Where&#39;s&#8212;where&#39;s&#10;anything? And what on earth set this wind&#10;a-blowing? &#60;em&#62;I&#60;/em&#62; didn&#39;t order no wind.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Fotheringay struggled to get to his feet in vain, and after&#10;one failure, remained on all fours, holding on. He surveyed the&#10;moonlit world to leeward, with the tails of his jacket streaming&#10;over his head. &#34;There&#39;s something&#60;a id=&#34;Page_355&#34;&#62;&#60;/a&#62; seriously wrong,&#34; said Mr. Fotheringay. &#34;And&#10;what it is&#8212;goodness knows.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Far and wide nothing was visible in the white glare through the&#10;haze of dust that drove before a screaming gale but tumbled masses&#10;of earth and heaps of inchoate ruins, no trees, no houses, no&#10;familiar shapes, only a wilderness of disorder vanishing at last&#10;into the darkness beneath the whirling columns and streamers, the&#10;lightnings and thunderings of a swiftly rising storm. Near him in&#10;the livid glare was something that might once have been an&#10;elm-tree, a smashed mass of splinters, shivered from boughs to&#10;base, and further a twisted mass of iron girders&#8212;only too evidently&#10;the viaduct&#8212;rose out of the piled confusion.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;You see, when Mr. Fotheringay had arrested the rotation of the&#10;solid globe, he had made no stipulation concerning the trifling&#10;movables upon its surface. And the earth spins so fast that the&#10;surface at its equator is travelling at rather more than a thousand&#10;miles an hour, and in these latitudes at more than half that pace.&#10;So that the village, and Mr. Maydig, and Mr. Fotheringay, and&#10;everybody and everything had been jerked violently forward at about&#10;nine miles per second&#8212;that is to say, much more violently than if&#10;they had been fired out of acannon. And&#10;every human being, every living creature, every house, and every&#10;tree&#8212;all the world as we know it&#8212;had been so jerked and smashed and&#10;utterly destroyed. That was all.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;These things Mr. Fotheringay did not, of course, fully&#10;appreciate. But he perceived that his miracle had miscarried, and&#10;with that a great disgust of miracles came upon him. He was in&#10;darkness now, for the clouds had swept together and blotted out his&#10;momentary glimpse of the moon, and the air was full of fitful&#10;struggling tortured wraiths of hail. A great roaring of wind and&#10;waters filled earth and sky, and, peering under his hand through&#10;the dust and sleet to windward, he saw by the play of the&#10;lightnings a vast wall of water pouring towards him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Maydig!&#34; screamed Mr. Fotheringay&#39;s feeble voice amid the&#10;elemental uproar. &#34;Here!&#8212;Maydig!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Stop!&#34; cried Mr. Fotheringay to the advancing water. &#34;Oh, for&#10;goodness&#39; sake, stop!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Just a moment,&#34; said Mr. Fotheringay to the lightnings and&#10;thunder. &#34;Stop jest a moment while I collect my thoughts&#8230; . And now&#10;what shall I do?&#34; he said. &#34;What &#60;em&#62;shall&#60;/em&#62; I do?&#10;Lord! I wish Maydig was about. &#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I know,&#34; said Mr. Fotheringay. &#34;And for goodness&#39; sake let&#39;s&#10;have it right &#60;em&#62;this&#60;/em&#62; time.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He remained on all fours, leaning against the wind, very intent&#10;to have everything right.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ah!&#34; he said. &#34;Let nothing what I&#39;m going to order happen until&#10;I say &#39;Off!&#39;&#8230; . Lord! I wish I&#39;d thought of that before!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He lifted his little voice against the whirlwind, shouting&#10;louder and louder in the vain desire to hear himself speak. &#34;Now&#10;then!&#8212;here goes! Mind about that what I said just now. In the first&#10;place, when all I&#39;ve got to say is done, let me lose my miraculous&#10;power, let my will become just like anybody else&#39;s will, and all&#10;these dangerous miracles be stopped. I don&#39;t like them. I&#39;d rather&#10;I didn&#39;t work &#39;em. Ever so much. That&#39;s the first thing. And the&#10;second is&#8212;let me be back just before the miracles begin; let&#10;everything be just as it was before that blessed lamp turned up.&#10;It&#39;s a big job, but it&#39;s the last. Have you got it? No more&#10;miracles, everything as it was&#8212;me back in the Long Dragon just&#10;before I drank my half-pint. That&#39;s it! Yes.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He dug his fingers into the mould, closed his eyes, and said&#10;&#34;Off!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Everything became perfectly still. He perceived that he was&#10;standing erect. &#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;So &#60;em&#62;you&#60;/em&#62; say,&#34; said a voice.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He opened his eyes. He was in the bar of the Long Dragon,&#10;arguing about miracles with Toddy Beamish. He had a vague sense of&#10;some great thing forgotten that instantaneously passed. You see&#10;that, except for the loss of his miraculous powers, everything was&#10;back as it had been, his mind and memory therefore were now just as&#10;they had been at the time when this story began. So that he knew&#10;absolutely nothing of all that is told here, knows nothing of all&#10;that is told here to this day. And among other things, of course,&#10;he still did not believe in miracles.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I tell you that miracles, properly speaking, can&#39;t possibly&#10;happen,&#34; he said, &#34;whatever you like to hold. And I&#39;m prepared to&#10;prove it up to the hilt.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That&#39;s what &#60;em&#62;you&#60;/em&#62; think,&#34; said Toddy Beamish,&#10;and &#34;Prove it if you can.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Looky here, Mr. Beamish,&#34; said Mr. Fotheringay. &#34;Let us clearly&#10;understand what a miracle is. It&#39;s something contrariwise to the&#10;course of nature done by power of Will&#8230; .&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 7, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/3469', :deleted => 0)
