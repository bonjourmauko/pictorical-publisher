But from the fact that, during a period of some two&#10;or three years, I have written five-and-twenty short stories whose&#10;general character may be so briefly defined, it cannot be fairly&#10;inferred &#8212; at all events it is not truly inferred &#8212; that I have,&#10;for this species of writing, any inordinate, or indeed any peculiar&#10;taste or prepossession. I may have written with an eye to this&#10;republication in volume form, and may, therefore, have desired to&#10;preserve, as far as a certain point, a certain unity of design.&#10;This is, indeed, the fact; and it may even happen that, in this&#10;manner, I shall never compose anything again. I speak of these&#10;things here, because I am led to think it is this prevalence of the&#10;&#34;Arabesque&#34; in my serious tales, which has induced one or two&#10;critics to tax me, in all friendliness, with what they have been&#10;pleased to term &#34;Germanism&#34; and gloom. The charge is in bad taste,&#10;and the grounds of the accusation have not been sufficiently&#10;considered. Let us admit, for the moment, that the&#10;&#34;phantasy-pieces&#34; now given are Germanic, or what not. Then&#10;Germanism is &#34;the vein&#34; for the time being. To morrow I may be&#10;anything but German, as yesterday I was everything else. These many&#10;pieces are yet one book. My friends would be quite as wise in&#10;taxing an astronomer with too much astronomy, or an ethical author&#10;with treating too largely of morals. But the truth is that, with a&#10;single exception, there is no one of these stories in which the&#10;scholar should recognise the distinctive features of that species&#10;of pseudo-horror which we are taught to call Germanic, for no&#10;better reason than that some of the secondary names of German&#10;literature have become identified with its folly. If in many of my&#10;productions terror has been the thesis, I maintain that terror is&#10;not of Germany, but of the soul, &#8212; that I have deduced this terror&#10;only from its legitimate sources, and urged it only to its&#10;legitimate results.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There are one or two of the articles here, (conceived and&#10;executed in the purest spirit of extravaganza,) to which I expect&#10;no serious attention, and of which I shall speak no farther. But&#10;for the rest I cannot conscientiously claim indulgence on the score&#10;of hasty effort. I think it best becomes me to say, therefore, that&#10;if I have sinned, I have deliberately sinned. These brief&#10;compositions are, in chief part, the results of matured purpose and&#10;very careful elaboration.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 1, :source => 'feedbooks')

Thrown by accident into her society many years ago,&#10;my soul from our first meeting, burned with fires it had never&#10;before known; but the fires were not of Eros, and bitter and&#10;tormenting to my spirit was the gradual conviction that I could in&#10;no manner define their unusual meaning or regulate their vague&#10;intensity. Yet we met; and fate bound us together at the altar, and&#10;I never spoke of passion nor thought of love. She, however, shunned&#10;society, and, attaching herself to me alone rendered me happy. It&#10;is a happiness to wonder; it is a happiness to dream.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Morella&#39;s erudition was profound. As I hope to live, her talents&#10;were of no common order&#8212;her powers of mind were gigantic. I felt&#10;this, and, in many matters, became her pupil. I soon, however,&#10;found that, perhaps on account of her Presburg education, she&#10;placed before me a number of those mystical writings which are&#10;usually considered the mere dross of the early German literature.&#10;These, for what reason I could not imagine, were her favourite and&#10;constant study&#8212;and that in process of time they became my own,&#10;should be attributed to the simple but effectual influence of habit&#10;and example.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In all this, if I err not, my reason had little to do. My&#10;convictions, or I forget myself, were in no manner acted upon by&#10;the ideal, nor was any tincture of the mysticism which I read to be&#10;discovered, unless I am greatly mistaken, either in my deeds or in&#10;my thoughts. Persuaded of this, I abandoned myself implicitly to&#10;the guidance of my wife, and entered with an unflinching heart into&#10;the intricacies of her studies. And then&#8212;then, when poring over&#10;forbidden pages, I felt a forbidden spirit enkindling within&#10;me&#8212;would Morella place her cold hand upon my own, and rake up from&#10;the ashes of a dead philosophy some low, singular words, whose&#10;strange meaning burned themselves in upon my memory. And then, hour&#10;after hour, would I linger by her side, and dwell upon the music of&#10;her voice, until at length its melody was tainted with terror, and&#10;there fell a shadow upon my soul, and I grew pale, and shuddered&#10;inwardly at those too unearthly tones. And thus, joy suddenly faded&#10;into horror, and the most beautiful became the most hideous, as&#10;Hinnon became Ge-Henna.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It is unnecessary to state the exact character of those&#10;disquisitions which, growing out of the volumes I have mentioned,&#10;formed, for so long a time, almost the sole conversation of Morella&#10;and myself. By the learned in what might be termed theological&#10;morality they will be readily conceived, and by the unlearned they&#10;would, at all events, be little understood. The wild Pantheism of&#10;Fichte; the modified Paliggenedia of the Pythagoreans; and, above&#10;all, the doctrines of Identity as urged by Schelling, were&#10;generally the points of discussion presenting the most of beauty to&#10;the imaginative Morella. That identity which is termed personal,&#10;Mr. Locke, I think, truly defines to consist in the saneness of&#10;rational being. And since by person we understand an intelligent&#10;essence having reason, and since there is a consciousness which&#10;always accompanies thinking, it is this which makes us all to be&#10;that which we call ourselves, thereby distinguishing us from other&#10;beings that think, and giving us our personal identity. But the&#10;principium indivduationis, the notion of that identity which at&#10;death is or is not lost for ever, was to me, at all times, a&#10;consideration of intense interest; not more from the perplexing and&#10;exciting nature of its consequences, than from the marked and&#10;agitated manner in which Morella mentioned them.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But, indeed, the time had now arrived when the mystery of my&#10;wife&#39;s manner oppressed me as a spell. I could no longer bear the&#10;touch of her wan fingers, nor the low tone of her musical language,&#10;nor the lustre of her melancholy eyes. And she knew all this, but&#10;did not upbraid; she seemed conscious of my weakness or my folly,&#10;and, smiling, called it fate. She seemed also conscious of a cause,&#10;to me unknown, for the gradual alienation of my regard; but she&#10;gave me no hint or token of its nature. Yet was she woman, and&#10;pined away daily. In time the crimson spot settled steadily upon&#10;the cheek, and the blue veins upon the pale forehead became&#10;prominent; and one instant my nature melted into pity, but in, next&#10;I met the glance of her meaning eyes, and then my soul sickened and&#10;became giddy with the giddiness of one who gazes downward into some&#10;dreary and unfathomable abyss.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Shall I then say that I longed with an earnest and consuming&#10;desire for the moment of Morella&#39;s decease? I did; but the fragile&#10;spirit clung to its tenement of clay for many days, for many weeks&#10;and irksome months, until my tortured nerves obtained the mastery&#10;over my mind, and I grew furious through delay, and, with the heart&#10;of a fiend, cursed the days and the hours and the bitter moments,&#10;which seemed to lengthen and lengthen as her gentle life declined,&#10;like shadows in the dying of the day.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But one autumnal evening, when the winds lay still in heaven,&#10;Morella called me to her bedside. There was a dim mist over all the&#10;earth, and a warm glow upon the waters, and amid the rich October&#10;leaves of the forest, a rainbow from the firmament had surely&#10;fallen.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It is a day of days,&#34; she said, as I approached; &#34;a day of all&#10;days either to live or die. It is a fair day for the sons of earth&#10;and life&#8212;ah, more fair for the daughters of heaven and death!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I kissed her forehead, and she continued:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I am dying, yet shall I live.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Morella!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The days have never been when thou couldst love me&#8212;but her whom&#10;in life thou didst abhor, in death thou shalt adore.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Morella!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I repeat I am dying. But within me is a pledge of that&#10;affection&#8212;ah, how little!&#8212;which thou didst feel for me, Morella.&#10;And when my spirit departs shall the child live&#8212;thy child and mine,&#10;Morella&#39;s. But thy days shall be days of sorrow&#8212;that sorrow which&#10;is the most lasting of impressions, as the cypress is the most&#10;enduring of trees. For the hours of thy happiness are over and joy&#10;is not gathered twice in a life, as the roses of Paestum twice in a&#10;year. Thou shalt no longer, then, play the Teian with time, but,&#10;being ignorant of the myrtle and the vine, thou shalt bear about&#10;with thee thy shroud on the earth, as do the Moslemin at&#10;Mecca.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Morella!&#34; I cried, &#34;Morella! how knowest thou this?&#34; but she&#10;turned away her face upon the pillow and a slight tremor coming&#10;over her limbs, she thus died, and I heard her voice no more.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Yet, as she had foretold, her child, to which in dying she had&#10;given birth, which breathed not until the mother breathed no more,&#10;her child, a daughter, lived. And she grew strangely in stature and&#10;intellect, and was the perfect resemblance of her who had departed,&#10;and I loved her with a love more fervent than I had believed it&#10;possible to feel for any denizen of earth.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But, ere long the heaven of this pure affection became darkened,&#10;and gloom, and horror, and grief swept over it in clouds. I said&#10;the child grew strangely in stature and intelligence. Strange,&#10;indeed, was her rapid increase in bodily size, but terrible, oh!&#10;terrible were the tumultuous thoughts which crowded upon me while&#10;watching the development of her mental being. Could it be&#10;otherwise, when I daily discovered in the conceptions of the child&#10;the adult powers and faculties of the woman? when the lessons of&#10;experience fell from the lips of infancy? and when the wisdom or&#10;the passions of maturity I found hourly gleaming from its full and&#10;speculative eye? When, I say, all this beeame evident to my&#10;appalled senses, when I could no longer hide it from my soul, nor&#10;throw it off from those perceptions which trembled to receive it,&#10;is it to be wondered at that suspicions, of a nature fearful and&#10;exciting, crept in upon my spirit, or that my thoughts fell back&#10;aghast upon the wild tales and thrilling theories of the entombed&#10;Morella? I snatched from the scrutiny of the world a being whom&#10;destiny compelled me to adore, and in the rigorous seclusion of my&#10;home, watched with an agonizing anxiety over all which concerned&#10;the beloved.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And as years rolled away, and I gazed day after day upon her&#10;holy, and mild, and eloquent face, and poured over her maturing&#10;form, day after day did I discover new points of resemblance in the&#10;child to her mother, the melancholy and the dead. And hourly grew&#10;darker these shadows of similitude, and more full, and more&#10;definite, and more perplexing, and more hideously terrible in their&#10;aspect. For that her smile was like her mother&#39;s I could bear; but&#10;then I shuddered at its too perfect identity, that her eyes were&#10;like Morella&#39;s I could endure; but then they, too, often looked&#10;down into the depths of my soul with Morella&#39;s own intense and&#10;bewildering meaning. And in the contour of the high forehead, and&#10;in the ringlets of the silken hair, and in the wan fingers which&#10;buried themselves therein, and in the sad musical tones of her&#10;speech, and above all&#8212;oh, above all, in the phrases and expressions&#10;of the dead on the lips of the loved and the living, I found food&#10;for consuming thought and horror, for a worm that would not&#10;die.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Thus passed away two lustra of her life, and as yet my daughter&#10;remained nameless upon the earth. &#34;My child,&#34; and &#34;my love,&#34; were&#10;the designations usually prompted by a father&#39;s affection, and the&#10;rigid seclusion of her days precluded all other intercourse.&#10;Morella&#39;s name died with her at her death. Of the mother I had&#10;never spoken to the daughter, it was impossible to speak. Indeed,&#10;during the brief period of her existence, the latter had received&#10;no impressions from the outward world, save such as might have been&#10;afforded by the narrow limits of her privacy. But at length the&#10;ceremony of baptism presented to my mind, in its unnerved and&#10;agitated condition, a present deliverance from the terrors of my&#10;destiny. And at the baptismal font I hesitated for a name. And many&#10;titles of the wise and beautiful, of old and modern times, of my&#10;own and foreign lands, came thronging to my lips, with many, many&#10;fair titles of the gentle, and the happy, and the good. What&#10;prompted me then to disturb the memory of the buried dead? What&#10;demon urged me to breathe that sound, which in its very&#10;recollection was wont to make ebb the purple blood in torrents from&#10;the temples to the heart? What fiend spoke from the recesses of my&#10;soul, when amid those dim aisles, and in the silence of the night,&#10;I whispered within the ears of the holy man the syllables&#8212;Morella?&#10;What more than fiend convulsed the features of my child, and&#10;overspread them with hues of death, as starting at that scarcely&#10;audible sound, she turned her glassy eyes from the earth to heaven,&#10;and falling prostrate on the black slabs of our ancestral vault,&#10;responded&#8212;&#34;I am here!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Distinct, coldly, calmly distinct, fell those few simple sounds&#10;within my ear, and thence like molten lead rolled hissingly into my&#10;brain. Years&#8212;years may pass away, but the memory of that epoch&#10;never. Nor was I indeed ignorant of the flowers and the vine&#8212;but&#10;the hemlock and the cypress overshadowed me night and day. And I&#10;kept no reckoning of time or place, and the stars of my fate faded&#10;from heaven, and therefore the earth grew dark, and its figures&#10;passed by me like flitting shadows, and among them all I beheld&#10;only&#8212;Morella. The winds of the firmament breathed but one sound&#10;within my ears, and the ripples upon the sea murmured&#10;evermore&#8212;Morella. But she died; and with my own hands I bore her to&#10;the tomb; and I laughed with a long and bitter laugh as I found no&#10;traces of the first in the channel where I laid the&#10;second.&#8212;Morella.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 1, :source => 'feedbooks')

My mother saw this and called me a genius:&#8212;my father&#10;wept for joy and presented me with a treatise on Nosology. This I&#10;mastered before I was breeched.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I now began to feel my way in the science, and soon came to&#10;understand that, provided a man had a nose sufficiently&#10;conspicuous, he might by merely following it, arrive at a Lionship.&#10;But my attention was not confined to theories alone. Every morning&#10;I gave my proboscis a couple of pulls and swallowed a half-dozen of&#10;drams.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When I came of age my father asked me, one day, if I would step&#10;with him into his study.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My son,&#34; he said, when we were seated, &#34;what is the chief end&#10;of your existence?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My father,&#34; I answered, &#34;it is the study of Nosology.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And what, Robert,&#34; he inquired, &#34;is Nosology?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Sir,&#34; I said, &#34;it is the science of Noses.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And can you tell me,&#34; he demanded, &#34;what is the meaning of a&#10;nose?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;A nose, my father,&#34; I replied, greatly softened, &#34;has been&#10;variously defined by about a thousand different authors.&#34; [Here I&#10;pulled out my watch.] &#34;It is now noon, or thereabouts&#8212;We shall have&#10;time enough to get through with them all before midnight. To&#10;commence then: The nose, according to Bartholinus, is that&#10;protuberance&#8212;that bump&#8212;that excresence&#8212;that&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Will do, Robert,&#34; interupted the old gentleman. &#34;I am&#10;thunderstruck at the extent of your information&#8212;I am&#10;positively&#8212;upon my soul.&#34; [Here he closed his eyes and placed his&#10;hand upon his heart.] &#34;Come here!&#34; [Here he took me by the arm.]&#10;&#34;Your education may now be considered as finished&#8212;it is high time&#10;you should scuffle for yourself&#8212;and you cannot do a better thing&#10;than merely follow your nose&#8212;so&#8212;so&#8212;so&#8212;&#34; [Here he kicked me down&#10;stairs and out of the door.]-&#34;So get out of my house, and God bless&#10;you!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As I felt within me the divine afflatus, I considered this&#10;accident rather fortunate than otherwise. I resolved to be guided&#10;by the paternal advice. I determined to follow my nose. I gave it a&#10;pull or two upon the spot, and wrote a pamphlet on Nosology&#10;forthwith.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;All Fum-Fudge was in an uproar.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Wonderful genius!&#34; said the Quarterly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Superb physiologist!&#34; said the Westminster.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Clever fellow!&#34; said the Foreign.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Fine writer!&#34;, said the Edinburgh.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Profound thinker!&#34; said the Dublin.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Great man!&#34; said Bentley.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Divine soul!&#34; said Fraser.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;One of us!&#34; said Blackwood.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Who can he be?&#34; said Mrs. Bas-Bleu.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What can he be?&#34; said big Miss Bas-Bleu.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Where can he be?&#34; said little Miss Bas-Bleu.&#8212;But I paid these&#10;people no attention whatever&#8212;I just stepped into the shop of an&#10;artist.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Duchess of Bless-my-Soul was sitting for her portrait; the&#10;Marquis of So-and-So was holding the Duchess&#39; poodle; the Earl of&#10;This-and-That was flirting with her salts; and his Royal Highness&#10;of Touch-me-Not was leaning upon the back of her chair.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I approached the artist and turned up my nose.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh, beautiful!&#34; sighed her Grace.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh, my!&#34; lisped the Marquis.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh, shocking!&#34; groaned the Earl.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh, abominable!&#34; growled his Royal Highness.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What will you take for it?&#34; asked the artist.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;For his nose!&#34; shouted her Grace.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;A thousand pounds,&#34; said I, sitting down.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;A thousand pounds?&#34; inquired the artist, musingly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;A thousand pounds,&#34; said I.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Beautiful!&#34; said he, entranced.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;A thousand pounds,&#34; said I.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Do you warrant it?&#34; he asked, turning the nose to the&#10;light.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I do,&#34; said I, blowing it well.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Is it quite original?&#34; he inquired, touching it with&#10;reverence.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Humph!&#34; said I, twisting it to one side.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Has no copy been taken?&#34; he demanded, surveying it through a&#10;microscope.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;None,&#34; said I, turning it up.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Admirable!&#34; he ejaculated, thrown quite off his guard by the&#10;beauty of the manoeuvre.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;A thousand pounds,&#34; said I.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;A thousand pounds?&#34; said he.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Precisely,&#34; said I.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;A thousand pounds?&#34; said he.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Just so,&#34; said I.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You shall have them,&#34; said he. &#34;What a piece of virtu!&#34; So he&#10;drew me a check upon the spot, and took a sketch of my nose. I&#10;engaged rooms in Jermyn street, and sent her Majesty the&#10;ninety-ninth edition of the &#34;Nosology,&#34; with a portrait of the&#10;proboscis. That sad little rake, the Prince of Wales, invited me to&#10;dinner.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;We are all lions and recherches.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There was a modern Platonist. He quoted Porphyry, Iamblicus,&#10;Plotinus, Proclus, Hierocles, Maximus Tyrius, and Syrianus.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There was a human-perfectibility man. He quoted Turgot, Price,&#10;Priestly, Condorcet, De Stael, and the &#34;Ambitious Student in&#10;Ill-Health.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There was Sir Positive Paradox. He observed that all fools were&#10;philosophers, and that all philosophers were fools.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There was Aestheticus Ethix. He spoke of fire, unity, and atoms;&#10;bi-part and pre-existent soul; affinity and discord; primitive&#10;intelligence and homoomeria.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There was Theologos Theology. He talked of Eusebius and Arianus;&#10;heresy and the Council of Nice; Puseyism and consubstantialism;&#10;Homousios and Homouioisios.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There was Fricassee from the Rocher de Cancale. He mentioned&#10;Muriton of red tongue; cauliflowers with veloute sauce; veal a la&#10;St. Menehoult; marinade a la St. Florentin; and orange jellies en&#10;mosaiques.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There was Bibulus O&#39;Bumper. He touched upon Latour and&#10;Markbrunnen; upon Mosseux and Chambertin; upon Richbourg and St.&#10;George; upon Haubrion, Leonville, and Medoc; upon Barac and&#10;Preignac; upon Grave, upon Sauterne, upon Lafitte, and upon St.&#10;Peray. He shook his head at Clos de Vougeot, and told with his eyes&#10;shut, the difference between Sherry and Amontillado.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There was Signor Tintontintino from Florence. He discoursed of&#10;Cimabue, Arpino, Carpaccio, and Argostino&#8212;of the gloom of&#10;Caravaggio, of the amenity of Albano, of the colors of Titian, of&#10;the frows of Rubens, and of the waggeries of Jan Steen.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There was the President of the Fum-Fudge University. He was of&#10;the opinion that the moon was called Bendis in Thrace, Bubastis in&#10;Egypt, Dian in Rome, and Artemis in Greece.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There was a Grand Turk from Stamboul. He could not help thinking&#10;that the angels were horses, cocks, and bulls; that somebody in the&#10;sixth heaven had seventy thousand heads; and that the earth was&#10;supported by a sky-blue cow with an incalculable number of green&#10;horns.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There was Delphinus Polyglott. He told us what had become of the&#10;eighty-three lost tragedies of Aeschylus; of the fifty-four&#10;orations of Isaeus; of the three hundred and ninety-one speeches of&#10;Lysias; of the hundred and eighty treatises of Theophrastus; of the&#10;eighth book of the conic sections of Apollonius; of Pindar&#39;s hymns&#10;and dithyrambics, and of the five and forty tragedies of Homer&#10;Junior.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There was Ferdinand Fitz-Fossillus Feltspar. He informed us all&#10;about internal fires and tertiary formations; about aeriforms,&#10;fluidiforms, and solidforms; about quartz and marl; about schist&#10;and schorl; about gypsum and trap; about talc and calc; about&#10;blende and horn-blende; about micaslate and pudding-stone; about&#10;cyanite and lepidolite; about haematite and tremolite; about&#10;antimony and calcedony; about manganese and whatever you&#10;please.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There was myself. I spoke of myself;&#8212;of myself, of myself, of&#10;myself;&#8212;of Nosology, of my pamphlet, and of myself. I turned up my&#10;nose, and I spoke of myself.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Marvellous clever man!&#34; said the Prince.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Superb!&#34; said his guests;&#8212;and next morning her Grace of&#10;Bless-my-soul paid me a visit.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Will you go to Almack&#39;s, pretty creature?&#34; she said, tapping me&#10;under the chin.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Upon honor,&#34; said I.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Nose and all?&#34; she asked.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;As I live,&#34; I replied.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Here then is a card, my life. Shall I say you will be&#10;there?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Dear, Duchess, with all my heart.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Pshaw, no!&#8212;but with all your nose?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Every bit of it, my love,&#34; said I:&#8212;so I gave it a twist or two,&#10;and found myself at Almack&#39;s.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The rooms were crowded to suffocation.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;He is coming!&#34; said somebody on the staircase.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;He is coming!&#34; said somebody farther up.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;He is coming!&#34; said somebody farther still.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;He is come!&#34; exclaimed the Duchess, &#34;He is come, the little&#10;love!&#34;&#8212;and, seizing me firmly by both hands, she kissed me thrice&#10;upon the nose.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A marked sensation immediately ensued.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Diavolo!&#34; cried Count Capricornutti.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Dios guarda!&#34; muttered Don Stiletto.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Mille tonnerres!&#34; ejaculated the Prince de Grenouille.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Tousand teufel!&#34; growled the Elector of Bluddennuff.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was not to be borne. I grew angry. I turned short upon&#10;Bluddennuff.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Sir!&#34; said I to him, &#34;you are a baboon.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Sir,&#34; he replied, after a pause. &#34;Donner und Blitzen!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;This was all that could be desired. We exchanged cards. At&#10;Chalk-Farm, the next morning, I shot off his nose&#8212;and then called&#10;upon my friends.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Bete!&#34; said the first.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Fool!&#34; said the second.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Dolt!&#34; said the third.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ass!&#34; said the fourth.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ninny!&#34; said the fifth.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Noodle!&#34; said the sixth.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Be off!&#34; said the seventh.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At all this I felt mortified, and so called upon my father.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Father,&#34; I asked, &#34;what is the chief end of my existence?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My son,&#34; he replied, &#34;it is still the study of Nosology; but in&#10;hitting the Elector upon the nose you have overshot your mark. You&#10;have a fine nose, it is true; but then Bluddennuff has none. You&#10;are damned, and he has become the hero of the day. I grant you that&#10;in Fum-Fudge the greatness of a lion is in proportion to the size&#10;of his proboscis&#8212;but, good heavens! there is no competing with a&#10;lion who has no proboscis at all.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 1, :source => 'feedbooks')

The fair&#10;page now lying before me need not be sullied with my real&#10;appellation. This has been already too much an object for the&#10;scorn&#8212;for the horror&#8212;for the detestation of my race. To the&#10;uttermost regions of the globe have not the indignant winds bruited&#10;its unparalleled infamy? Oh, outcast of all outcasts most&#10;abandoned!&#8212;to the earth art thou not forever dead? to its honors,&#10;to its flowers, to its golden aspirations?&#8212;and a cloud, dense,&#10;dismal, and limitless, does it not hang eternally between thy hopes&#10;and heaven?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I would not, if I could, here or to-day, embody a record of my&#10;later years of unspeakable misery, and unpardonable crime. This&#10;epoch&#8212;these later years&#8212;took unto themselves a sudden elevation in&#10;turpitude, whose origin alone it is my present purpose to assign.&#10;Men usually grow base by degrees. From me, in an instant, all&#10;virtue dropped bodily as a mantle. From comparatively trivial&#10;wickedness I passed, with the stride of a giant, into more than the&#10;enormities of an Elah-Gabalus. What chance&#8212;what one event brought&#10;this evil thing to pass, bear with me while I relate. Death&#10;approaches; and the shadow which foreruns him has thrown a&#10;softening influence over my spirit. I long, in passing through the&#10;dim valley, for the sympathy&#8212;I had nearly said for the pity&#8212;of my&#10;fellow men. I would fain have them believe that I have been, in&#10;some measure, the slave of circumstances beyond human control. I&#10;would wish them to seek out for me, in the details I am about to&#10;give, some little oasis of fatality amid a wilderness of error. I&#10;would have them allow&#8212;what they cannot refrain from allowing&#8212;that,&#10;although temptation may have erewhile existed as great, man was&#10;never thus, at least, tempted before&#8212;certainly, never thus fell.&#10;And is it therefore that he has never thus suffered? Have I not&#10;indeed been living in a dream? And am I not now dying a victim to&#10;the horror and the mystery of the wildest of all sublunary&#10;visions?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I am the descendant of a race whose imaginative and easily&#10;excitable temperament has at all times rendered them remarkable;&#10;and, in my earliest infancy, I gave evidence of having fully&#10;inherited the family character. As I advanced in years it was more&#10;strongly developed; becoming, for many reasons, a cause of serious&#10;disquietude to my friends, and of positive injury to myself. I grew&#10;self-willed, addicted to the wildest caprices, and a prey to the&#10;most ungovernable passions. Weak-minded, and beset with&#10;constitutional infirmities akin to my own, my parents could do but&#10;little to check the evil propensities which distinguished me. Some&#10;feeble and ill-directed efforts resulted in complete failure on&#10;their part, and, of course, in total triumph on mine. Thenceforward&#10;my voice was a household law; and at an age when few children have&#10;abandoned their leading-strings, I was left to the guidance of my&#10;own will, and became, in all but name, the master of my own&#10;actions.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;My earliest recollections of a school-life, are connected with a&#10;large, rambling, Elizabethan house, in a misty-looking village of&#10;England, where were a vast number of gigantic and gnarled trees,&#10;and where all the houses were excessively ancient. In truth, it was&#10;a dream-like and spirit-soothing place, that venerable old town. At&#10;this moment, in fancy, I feel the refreshing chilliness of its&#10;deeply-shadowed avenues, inhale the fragrance of its thousand&#10;shrubberies, and thrill anew with undefinable delight, at the deep&#10;hollow note of the church-bell, breaking, each hour, with sullen&#10;and sudden roar, upon the stillness of the dusky atmosphere in&#10;which the fretted Gothic steeple lay imbedded and asleep.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It gives me, perhaps, as much of pleasure as I can now in any&#10;manner experience, to dwell upon minute recollections of the school&#10;and its concerns. Steeped in misery as I am&#8212;misery, alas! only too&#10;real&#8212;I shall be pardoned for seeking relief, however slight and&#10;temporary, in the weakness of a few rambling details. These,&#10;moreover, utterly trivial, and even ridiculous in themselves,&#10;assume, to my fancy, adventitious importance, as connected with a&#10;period and a locality when and where I recognise the first&#10;ambiguous monitions of the destiny which afterwards so fully&#10;overshadowed me. Let me then remember.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The house, I have said, was old and irregular. The grounds were&#10;extensive, and a high and solid brick wall, topped with a bed of&#10;mortar and broken glass, encompassed the whole. This prison-like&#10;rampart formed the limit of our domain; beyond it we saw but thrice&#10;a week&#8212;once every Saturday afternoon, when, attended by two ushers,&#10;we were permitted to take brief walks in a body through some of the&#10;neighbouring fields&#8212;and twice during Sunday, when we were paraded&#10;in the same formal manner to the morning and evening service in the&#10;one church of the village. Of this church the principal of our&#10;school was pastor. With how deep a spirit of wonder and perplexity&#10;was I wont to regard him from our remote pew in the gallery, as,&#10;with step solemn and slow, he ascended the pulpit! This reverend&#10;man, with countenance so demurely benign, with robes so glossy and&#10;so clerically flowing, with wig so minutely powdered, so rigid and&#10;so vast,&#8212;could this be he who, of late, with sour visage, and in&#10;snuffy habiliments, administered, ferule in hand, the Draconian&#10;laws of the academy? Oh, gigantic paradox, too utterly monstrous&#10;for solution!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At an angle of the ponderous wall frowned a more ponderous gate.&#10;It was riveted and studded with iron bolts, and surmounted with&#10;jagged iron spikes. What impressions of deep awe did it inspire! It&#10;was never opened save for the three periodical egressions and&#10;ingressions already mentioned; then, in every creak of its mighty&#10;hinges, we found a plenitude of mystery&#8212;a world of matter for&#10;solemn remark, or for more solemn meditation.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The extensive enclosure was irregular in form, having many&#10;capacious recesses. Of these, three or four of the largest&#10;constituted the play-ground. It was level, and covered with fine&#10;hard gravel. I well remember it had no trees, nor benches, nor&#10;anything similar within it. Of course it was in the rear of the&#10;house. In front lay a small parterre, planted with box and other&#10;shrubs; but through this sacred division we passed only upon rare&#10;occasions indeed&#8212;such as a first advent to school or final&#10;departure thence, or perhaps, when a parent or friend having called&#10;for us, we joyfully took our way home for the Christmas or&#10;Midsummer holy-days.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But the house!&#8212;how quaint an old building was this!&#8212;to me how&#10;veritably a palace of enchantment! There was really no end to its&#10;windings&#8212;to its incomprehensible subdivisions. It was difficult, at&#10;any given time, to say with certainty upon which of its two stories&#10;one happened to be. From each room to every other there were sure&#10;to be found three or four steps either in ascent or descent. Then&#10;the lateral branches were innumerable&#8212;inconceivable&#8212;and so&#10;returning in upon themselves, that our most exact ideas in regard&#10;to the whole mansion were not very far different from those with&#10;which we pondered upon infinity. During the five years of my&#10;residence here, I was never able to ascertain with precision, in&#10;what remote locality lay the little sleeping apartment assigned to&#10;myself and some eighteen or twenty other scholars.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The school-room was the largest in the house&#8212;I could not help&#10;thinking, in the world. It was very long, narrow, and dismally low,&#10;with pointed Gothic windows and a ceiling of oak. In a remote and&#10;terror-inspiring angle was a square enclosure of eight or ten feet,&#10;comprising the sanctum, &#34;during hours,&#34; of our principal, the&#10;Reverend Dr. Bransby. It was a solid structure, with massy door,&#10;sooner than open which in the absence of the &#34;Dominic,&#34; we would&#10;all have willingly perished by the peine forte et dure. In other&#10;angles were two other similar boxes, far less reverenced, indeed,&#10;but still greatly matters of awe. One of these was the pulpit of&#10;the &#34;classical&#34; usher, one of the &#34;English and mathematical.&#34;&#10;Interspersed about the room, crossing and recrossing in endless&#10;irregularity, were innumerable benches and desks, black, ancient,&#10;and time-worn, piled desperately with much-bethumbed books, and so&#10;beseamed with initial letters, names at full length, grotesque&#10;figures, and other multiplied efforts of the knife, as to have&#10;entirely lost what little of original form might have been their&#10;portion in days long departed. A huge bucket with water stood at&#10;one extremity of the room, and a clock of stupendous dimensions at&#10;the other.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Encompassed by the massy walls of this venerable academy, I&#10;passed, yet not in tedium or disgust, the years of the third&#10;lustrum of my life. The teeming brain of childhood requires no&#10;external world of incident to occupy or amuse it; and the&#10;apparently dismal monotony of a school was replete with more&#10;intense excitement than my riper youth has derived from luxury, or&#10;my full manhood from crime. Yet I must believe that my first mental&#10;development had in it much of the uncommon&#8212;even much of the outre.&#10;Upon mankind at large the events of very early existence rarely&#10;leave in mature age any definite impression. All is gray shadow&#8212;a&#10;weak and irregular remembrance&#8212;an indistinct regathering of feeble&#10;pleasures and phantasmagoric pains. With me this is not so. In&#10;childhood I must have felt with the energy of a man what I now find&#10;stamped upon memory in lines as vivid, as deep, and as durable as&#10;the exergues of the Carthaginian medals.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Yet in fact&#8212;in the fact of the world&#39;s view&#8212;how little was there&#10;to remember! The morning&#39;s awakening, the nightly summons to bed;&#10;the connings, the recitations; the periodical half-holidays, and&#10;perambulations; the play-ground, with its broils, its pastimes, its&#10;intrigues;&#8212;these, by a mental sorcery long forgotten, were made to&#10;involve a wilderness of sensation, a world of rich incident, an&#10;universe of varied emotion, of excitement the most passionate and&#10;spirit-stirring. &#34;Oh, le bon temps, que ce siecle de fer!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In truth, the ardor, the enthusiasm, and the imperiousness of my&#10;disposition, soon rendered me a marked character among my&#10;schoolmates, and by slow, but natural gradations, gave me an&#10;ascendancy over all not greatly older than myself;&#8212;over all with a&#10;single exception. This exception was found in the person of a&#10;scholar, who, although no relation, bore the same Christian and&#10;surname as myself;&#8212;a circumstance, in fact, little remarkable; for,&#10;notwithstanding a noble descent, mine was one of those everyday&#10;appellations which seem, by prescriptive right, to have been, time&#10;out of mind, the common property of the mob. In this narrative I&#10;have therefore designated myself as William Wilson,&#8212;a fictitious&#10;title not very dissimilar to the real. My namesake alone, of those&#10;who in school phraseology constituted &#34;our set,&#34; presumed to&#10;compete with me in the studies of the class&#8212;in the sports and&#10;broils of the play-ground&#8212;to refuse implicit belief in my&#10;assertions, and submission to my will&#8212;indeed, to interfere with my&#10;arbitrary dictation in any respect whatsoever. If there is on earth&#10;a supreme and unqualified despotism, it is the despotism of a&#10;master mind in boyhood over the less energetic spirits of its&#10;companions.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Wilson&#39;s rebellion was to me a source of the greatest&#10;embarrassment;&#8212;the more so as, in spite of the bravado with which&#10;in public I made a point of treating him and his pretensions, I&#10;secretly felt that I feared him, and could not help thinking the&#10;equality which he maintained so easily with myself, a proof of his&#10;true superiority; since not to be overcome cost me a perpetual&#10;struggle. Yet this superiority&#8212;even this equality&#8212;was in truth&#10;acknowledged by no one but myself; our associates, by some&#10;unaccountable blindness, seemed not even to suspect it. Indeed, his&#10;competition, his resistance, and especially his impertinent and&#10;dogged interference with my purposes, were not more pointed than&#10;private. He appeared to be destitute alike of the ambition which&#10;urged, and of the passionate energy of mind which enabled me to&#10;excel. In his rivalry he might have been supposed actuated solely&#10;by a whimsical desire to thwart, astonish, or mortify myself;&#10;although there were times when I could not help observing, with a&#10;feeling made up of wonder, abasement, and pique, that he mingled&#10;with his injuries, his insults, or his contradictions, a certain&#10;most inappropriate, and assuredly most unwelcome affectionateness&#10;of manner. I could only conceive this singular behavior to arise&#10;from a consummate self-conceit assuming the vulgar airs of&#10;patronage and protection.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Perhaps it was this latter trait in Wilson&#39;s conduct, conjoined&#10;with our identity of name, and the mere accident of our having&#10;entered the school upon the same day, which set afloat the notion&#10;that we were brothers, among the senior classes in the academy.&#10;These do not usually inquire with much strictness into the affairs&#10;of their juniors. I have before said, or should have said, that&#10;Wilson was not, in the most remote degree, connected with my&#10;family. But assuredly if we had been brothers we must have been&#10;twins; for, after leaving Dr. Bransby&#39;s, I casually learned that my&#10;namesake was born on the nineteenth of January, 1813&#8212;and this is a&#10;somewhat remarkable coincidence; for the day is precisely that of&#10;my own nativity.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It may seem strange that in spite of the continual anxiety&#10;occasioned me by the rivalry of Wilson, and his intolerable spirit&#10;of contradiction, I could not bring myself to hate him altogether.&#10;We had, to be sure, nearly every day a quarrel in which, yielding&#10;me publicly the palm of victory, he, in some manner, contrived to&#10;make me feel that it was he who had deserved it; yet a sense of&#10;pride on my part, and a veritable dignity on his own, kept us&#10;always upon what are called &#34;speaking terms,&#34; while there were many&#10;points of strong congeniality in our tempers, operating to awake me&#10;in a sentiment which our position alone, perhaps, prevented from&#10;ripening into friendship. It is difficult, indeed, to define, or&#10;even to describe, my real feelings towards him. They formed a&#10;motley and heterogeneous admixture;&#8212;some petulant animosity, which&#10;was not yet hatred, some esteem, more respect, much fear, with a&#10;world of uneasy curiosity. To the moralist it will be unnecessary&#10;to say, in addition, that Wilson and myself were the most&#10;inseparable of companions.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was no doubt the anomalous state of affairs existing between&#10;us, which turned all my attacks upon him, (and they were many,&#10;either open or covert) into the channel of banter or practical joke&#10;(giving pain while assuming the aspect of mere fun) rather than&#10;into a more serious and determined hostility. But my endeavours on&#10;this head were by no means uniformly successful, even when my plans&#10;were the most wittily concocted; for my namesake had much about&#10;him, in character, of that unassuming and quiet austerity which,&#10;while enjoying the poignancy of its own jokes, has no heel of&#10;Achilles in itself, and absolutely refuses to be laughed at. I&#10;could find, indeed, but one vulnerable point, and that, lying in a&#10;personal peculiarity, arising, perhaps, from constitutional&#10;disease, would have been spared by any antagonist less at his wit&#39;s&#10;end than myself;&#8212;my rival had a weakness in the faucal or guttural&#10;organs, which precluded him from raising his voice at any time&#10;above a very low whisper. Of this defect I did not fall to take&#10;what poor advantage lay in my power.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Wilson&#39;s retaliations in kind were many; and there was one form&#10;of his practical wit that disturbed me beyond measure. How his&#10;sagacity first discovered at all that so petty a thing would vex&#10;me, is a question I never could solve; but, having discovered, he&#10;habitually practised the annoyance. I had always felt aversion to&#10;my uncourtly patronymic, and its very common, if not plebeian&#10;praenomen. The words were venom in my ears; and when, upon the day&#10;of my arrival, a second William Wilson came also to the academy, I&#10;felt angry with him for bearing the name, and doubly disgusted with&#10;the name because a stranger bore it, who would be the cause of its&#10;twofold repetition, who would be constantly in my presence, and&#10;whose concerns, in the ordinary routine of the school business,&#10;must inevitably, on account of the detestable coincidence, be often&#10;confounded with my own.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The feeling of vexation thus engendered grew stronger with every&#10;circumstance tending to show resemblance, moral or physical,&#10;between my rival and myself. I had not then discovered the&#10;remarkable fact that we were of the same age; but I saw that we&#10;were of the same height, and I perceived that we were even&#10;singularly alike in general contour of person and outline of&#10;feature. I was galled, too, by the rumor touching a relationship,&#10;which had grown current in the upper forms. In a word, nothing&#10;could more seriously disturb me, although I scrupulously concealed&#10;such disturbance,) than any allusion to a similarity of mind,&#10;person, or condition existing between us. But, in truth, I had no&#10;reason to believe that (with the exception of the matter of&#10;relationship, and in the case of Wilson himself,) this similarity&#10;had ever been made a subject of comment, or even observed at all by&#10;our schoolfellows. That he observed it in all its bearings, and as&#10;fixedly as I, was apparent; but that he could discover in such&#10;circumstances so fruitful a field of annoyance, can only be&#10;attributed, as I said before, to his more than ordinary&#10;penetration.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;His cue, which was to perfect an imitation of myself, lay both&#10;in words and in actions; and most admirably did he play his part.&#10;My dress it was an easy matter to copy; my gait and general manner&#10;were, without difficulty, appropriated; in spite of his&#10;constitutional defect, even my voice did not escape him. My louder&#10;tones were, of course, unattempted, but then the key, it was&#10;identical; and his singular whisper, it grew the very echo of my&#10;own.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;How greatly this most exquisite portraiture harassed me, (for it&#10;could not justly be termed a caricature,) I will not now venture to&#10;describe. I had but one consolation&#8212;in the fact that the imitation,&#10;apparently, was noticed by myself alone, and that I had to endure&#10;only the knowing and strangely sarcastic smiles of my namesake&#10;himself. Satisfied with having produced in my bosom the intended&#10;effect, he seemed to chuckle in secret over the sting he had&#10;inflicted, and was characteristically disregardful of the public&#10;applause which the success of his witty endeavours might have so&#10;easily elicited. That the school, indeed, did not feel his design,&#10;perceive its accomplishment, and participate in his sneer, was, for&#10;many anxious months, a riddle I could not resolve. Perhaps the&#10;gradation of his copy rendered it not so readily perceptible; or,&#10;more possibly, I owed my security to the master air of the copyist,&#10;who, disdaining the letter, (which in a painting is all the obtuse&#10;can see,) gave but the full spirit of his original for my&#10;individual contemplation and chagrin.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I have already more than once spoken of the disgusting air of&#10;patronage which he assumed toward me, and of his frequent officious&#10;interference withy my will. This interference often took the&#10;ungracious character of advice; advice not openly given, but hinted&#10;or insinuated. I received it with a repugnance which gained&#10;strength as I grew in years. Yet, at this distant day, let me do&#10;him the simple justice to acknowledge that I can recall no occasion&#10;when the suggestions of my rival were on the side of those errors&#10;or follies so usual to his immature age and seeming inexperience;&#10;that his moral sense, at least, if not his general talents and&#10;worldly wisdom, was far keener than my own; and that I might,&#10;to-day, have been a better, and thus a happier man, had I less&#10;frequently rejected the counsels embodied in those meaning whispers&#10;which I then but too cordially hated and too bitterly despised.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As it was, I at length grew restive in the extreme under his&#10;distasteful supervision, and daily resented more and more openly&#10;what I considered his intolerable arrogance. I have said that, in&#10;the first years of our connexion as schoolmates, my feelings in&#10;regard to him might have been easily ripened into friendship: but,&#10;in the latter months of my residence at the academy, although the&#10;intrusion of his ordinary manner had, beyond doubt, in some&#10;measure, abated, my sentiments, in nearly similar proportion,&#10;partook very much of positive hatred. Upon one occasion he saw&#10;this, I think, and afterwards avoided, or made a show of avoiding&#10;me.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was about the same period, if I remember aright, that, in an&#10;altercation of violence with him, in which he was more than usually&#10;thrown off his guard, and spoke and acted with an openness of&#10;demeanor rather foreign to his nature, I discovered, or fancied I&#10;discovered, in his accent, his air, and general appearance, a&#10;something which first startled, and then deeply interested me, by&#10;bringing to mind dim visions of my earliest infancy&#8212;wild, confused&#10;and thronging memories of a time when memory herself was yet&#10;unborn. I cannot better describe the sensation which oppressed me&#10;than by saying that I could with difficulty shake off the belief of&#10;my having been acquainted with the being who stood before me, at&#10;some epoch very long ago&#8212;some point of the past even infinitely&#10;remote. The delusion, however, faded rapidly as it came; and I&#10;mention it at all but to define the day of the last conversation I&#10;there held with my singular namesake.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The huge old house, with its countless subdivisions, had several&#10;large chambers communicating with each other, where slept the&#10;greater number of the students. There were, however, (as must&#10;necessarily happen in a building so awkwardly planned,) many little&#10;nooks or recesses, the odds and ends of the structure; and these&#10;the economic ingenuity of Dr. Bransby had also fitted up as&#10;dormitories; although, being the merest closets, they were capable&#10;of accommodating but a single individual. One of these small&#10;apartments was occupied by Wilson.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;One night, about the close of my fifth year at the school, and&#10;immediately after the altercation just mentioned, finding every one&#10;wrapped in sleep, I arose from bed, and, lamp in hand, stole&#10;through a wilderness of narrow passages from my own bedroom to that&#10;of my rival. I had long been plotting one of those ill-natured&#10;pieces of practical wit at his expense in which I had hitherto been&#10;so uniformly unsuccessful. It was my intention, now, to put my&#10;scheme in operation, and I resolved to make him feel the whole&#10;extent of the malice with which I was imbued. Having reached his&#10;closet, I noiselessly entered, leaving the lamp, with a shade over&#10;it, on the outside. I advanced a step, and listened to the sound of&#10;his tranquil breathing. Assured of his being asleep, I returned,&#10;took the light, and with it again approached the bed. Close&#10;curtains were around it, which, in the prosecution of my plan, I&#10;slowly and quietly withdrew, when the bright rays fell vividly upon&#10;the sleeper, and my eyes, at the same moment, upon his countenance.&#10;I looked;&#8212;and a numbness, an iciness of feeling instantly pervaded&#10;my frame. My breast heaved, my knees tottered, my whole spirit&#10;became possessed with an objectless yet intolerable horror. Gasping&#10;for breath, I lowered the lamp in still nearer proximity to the&#10;face. Were these&#8212;these the lineaments of William Wilson? I saw,&#10;indeed, that they were his, but I shook as if with a fit of the&#10;ague in fancying they were not. What was there about them to&#10;confound me in this manner? I gazed;&#8212;while my brain reeled with a&#10;multitude of incoherent thoughts. Not thus he appeared&#8212;assuredly&#10;not thus&#8212;in the vivacity of his waking hours. The same name! the&#10;same contour of person! the same day of arrival at the academy! And&#10;then his dogged and meaningless imitation of my gait, my voice, my&#10;habits, and my manner! Was it, in truth, within the bounds of human&#10;possibility, that what I now saw was the result, merely, of the&#10;habitual practice of this sarcastic imitation? Awe-stricken, and&#10;with a creeping shudder, I extinguished the lamp, passed silently&#10;from the chamber, and left, at once, the halls of that old academy,&#10;never to enter them again.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;After a lapse of some months, spent at home in mere idleness, I&#10;found myself a student at Eton. The brief interval had been&#10;sufficient to enfeeble my remembrance of the events at Dr.&#10;Bransby&#39;s, or at least to effect a material change in the nature of&#10;the feelings with which I remembered them. The truth&#8212;the tragedy&#8212;of&#10;the drama was no more. I could now find room to doubt the evidence&#10;of my senses; and seldom called up the subject at all but with&#10;wonder at extent of human credulity, and a smile at the vivid force&#10;of the imagination which I hereditarily possessed. Neither was this&#10;species of scepticism likely to be diminished by the character of&#10;the life I led at Eton. The vortex of thoughtless folly into which&#10;I there so immediately and so recklessly plunged, washed away all&#10;but the froth of my past hours, engulfed at once every solid or&#10;serious impression, and left to memory only the veriest levities of&#10;a former existence.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I do not wish, however, to trace the course of my miserable&#10;profligacy here&#8212;a profligacy which set at defiance the laws, while&#10;it eluded the vigilance of the institution. Three years of folly,&#10;passed without profit, had but given me rooted habits of vice, and&#10;added, in a somewhat unusual degree, to my bodily stature, when,&#10;after a week of soulless dissipation, I invited a small party of&#10;the most dissolute students to a secret carousal in my chambers. We&#10;met at a late hour of the night; for our debaucheries were to be&#10;faithfully protracted until morning. The wine flowed freely, and&#10;there were not wanting other and perhaps more dangerous seductions;&#10;so that the gray dawn had already faintly appeared in the east,&#10;while our delirious extravagance was at its height. Madly flushed&#10;with cards and intoxication, I was in the act of insisting upon a&#10;toast of more than wonted profanity, when my attention was suddenly&#10;diverted by the violent, although partial unclosing of the door of&#10;the apartment, and by the eager voice of a servant from without. He&#10;said that some person, apparently in great haste, demanded to speak&#10;with me in the hall.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Wildly excited with wine, the unexpected interruption rather&#10;delighted than surprised me. I staggered forward at once, and a few&#10;steps brought me to the vestibule of the building. In this low and&#10;small room there hung no lamp; and now no light at all was&#10;admitted, save that of the exceedingly feeble dawn which made its&#10;way through the semi-circular window. As I put my foot over the&#10;threshold, I became aware of the figure of a youth about my own&#10;height, and habited in a white kerseymere morning frock, cut in the&#10;novel fashion of the one I myself wore at the moment. This the&#10;faint light enabled me to perceive; but the features of his face I&#10;could not distinguish. Upon my entering he strode hurriedly up to&#10;me, and, seizing me by. the arm with a gesture of petulant&#10;impatience, whispered the words &#34;William Wilson!&#34; in my ear.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I grew perfectly sober in an instant. There was that in the&#10;manner of the stranger, and in the tremulous shake of his uplifted&#10;finger, as he held it between my eyes and the light, which filled&#10;me with unqualified amazement; but it was not this which had so&#10;violently moved me. It was the pregnancy of solemn admonition in&#10;the singular, low, hissing utterance; and, above all, it was the&#10;character, the tone, the key, of those few, simple, and familiar,&#10;yet whispered syllables, which came with a thousand thronging&#10;memories of bygone days, and struck upon my soul with the shock of&#10;a galvanic battery. Ere I could recover the use of my senses he was&#10;gone.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Although this event failed not of a vivid effect upon my&#10;disordered imagination, yet was it evanescent as vivid. For some&#10;weeks, indeed, I busied myself in earnest inquiry, or was wrapped&#10;in a cloud of morbid speculation. I did not pretend to disguise&#10;from my perception the identity of the singular individual who thus&#10;perseveringly interfered with my affairs, and harassed me with his&#10;insinuated counsel. But who and what was this Wilson?&#8212;and whence&#10;came he?&#8212;and what were his purposes? Upon neither of these points&#10;could I be satisfied; merely ascertaining, in regard to him, that a&#10;sudden accident in his family had caused his removal from Dr.&#10;Bransby&#39;s academy on the afternoon of the day in which I myself had&#10;eloped. But in a brief period I ceased to think upon the subject;&#10;my attention being all absorbed in a contemplated departure for&#10;Oxford. Thither I soon went; the uncalculating vanity of my parents&#10;furnishing me with an outfit and annual establishment, which would&#10;enable me to indulge at will in the luxury already so dear to my&#10;heart,&#8212;to vie in profuseness of expenditure with the haughtiest&#10;heirs of the wealthiest earldoms in Great Britain.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Excited by such appliances to vice, my constitutional&#10;temperament broke forth with redoubled ardor, and I spurned even&#10;the common restraints of decency in the mad infatuation of my&#10;revels. But it were absurd to pause in the detail of my&#10;extravagance. Let it suffice, that among spendthrifts I out-Heroded&#10;Herod, and that, giving name to a multitude of novel follies, I&#10;added no brief appendix to the long catalogue of vices then usual&#10;in the most dissolute university of Europe.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It could hardly be credited, however, that I had, even here, so&#10;utterly fallen from the gentlemanly estate, as to seek acquaintance&#10;with the vilest arts of the gambler by profession, and, having&#10;become an adept in his despicable science, to practise it&#10;habitually as a means of increasing my already enormous income at&#10;the expense of the weak-minded among my fellow-collegians. Such,&#10;nevertheless, was the fact. And the very enormity of this offence&#10;against all manly and honourable sentiment proved, beyond doubt,&#10;the main if not the sole reason of the impunity with which it was&#10;committed. Who, indeed, among my most abandoned associates, would&#10;not rather have disputed the clearest evidence of his senses, than&#10;have suspected of such courses, the gay, the frank, the generous&#10;William Wilson&#8212;the noblest and most commoner at Oxford&#8212;him whose&#10;follies (said his parasites) were but the follies of youth and&#10;unbridled fancy&#8212;whose errors but inimitable whim&#8212;whose darkest vice&#10;but a careless and dashing extravagance?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I had been now two years successfully busied in this way, when&#10;there came to the university a young parvenu nobleman,&#10;Glendinning&#8212;rich, said report, as Herodes Atticus&#8212;his riches, too,&#10;as easily acquired. I soon found him of weak intellect, and, of&#10;course, marked him as a fitting subject for my skill. I frequently&#10;engaged him in play, and contrived, with the gambler&#39;s usual art,&#10;to let him win considerable sums, the more effectually to entangle&#10;him in my snares. At length, my schemes being ripe, I met him (with&#10;the full intention that this meeting should be final and decisive)&#10;at the chambers of a fellow-commoner, (Mr. Preston,) equally&#10;intimate with both, but who, to do him Justice, entertained not&#10;even a remote suspicion of my design. To give to this a better&#10;colouring, I had contrived to have assembled a party of some eight&#10;or ten, and was solicitously careful that the introduction of cards&#10;should appear accidental, and originate in the proposal of my&#10;contemplated dupe himself. To be brief upon a vile topic, none of&#10;the low finesse was omitted, so customary upon similar occasions&#10;that it is a just matter for wonder how any are still found so&#10;besotted as to fall its victim.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;We had protracted our sitting far into the night, and I had at&#10;length effected the manoeuvre of getting Glendinning as my sole&#10;antagonist. The game, too, was my favorite ecarte!. The rest of the&#10;company, interested in the extent of our play, had abandoned their&#10;own cards, and were standing around us as spectators. The parvenu,&#10;who had been induced by my artifices in the early part of the&#10;evening, to drink deeply, now shuffled, dealt, or played, with a&#10;wild nervousness of manner for which his intoxication, I thought,&#10;might partially, but could not altogether account. In a very short&#10;period he had become my debtor to a large amount, when, having&#10;taken a long draught of port, he did precisely what I had been&#10;coolly anticipating&#8212;he proposed to double our already extravagant&#10;stakes. With a well-feigned show of reluctance, and not until after&#10;my repeated refusal had seduced him into some angry words which&#10;gave a color of pique to my compliance, did I finally comply. The&#10;result, of course, did but prove how entirely the prey was in my&#10;toils; in less than an hour he had quadrupled his debt. For some&#10;time his countenance had been losing the florid tinge lent it by&#10;the wine; but now, to my astonishment, I perceived that it had&#10;grown to a pallor truly fearful. I say to my astonishment.&#10;Glendinning had been represented to my eager inquiries as&#10;immeasurably wealthy; and the sums which he had as yet lost,&#10;although in themselves vast, could not, I supposed, very seriously&#10;annoy, much less so violently affect him. That he was overcome by&#10;the wine just swallowed, was the idea which most readily presented&#10;itself; and, rather with a view to the preservation of my own&#10;character in the eyes of my associates, than from any less&#10;interested motive, I was about to insist, peremptorily, upon a&#10;discontinuance of the play, when some expressions at my elbow from&#10;among the company, and an ejaculation evincing utter despair on the&#10;part of Glendinning, gave me to understand that I had effected his&#10;total ruin under circumstances which, rendering him an object for&#10;the pity of all, should have protected him from the ill offices&#10;even of a fiend.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;What now might have been my conduct it is difficult to say. The&#10;pitiable condition of my dupe had thrown an air of embarrassed&#10;gloom over all; and, for some moments, a profound silence was&#10;maintained, during which I could not help feeling my cheeks tingle&#10;with the many burning glances of scorn or reproach cast upon me by&#10;the less abandoned of the party. I will even own that an&#10;intolerable weight of anxiety was for a brief instant lifted from&#10;my bosom by the sudden and extraordinary interruption which ensued.&#10;The wide, heavy folding doors of the apartment were all at once&#10;thrown open, to their full extent, with a vigorous and rushing&#10;impetuosity that extinguished, as if by magic, every candle in the&#10;room. Their light, in dying, enabled us just to perceive that a&#10;stranger had entered, about my own height, and closely muffled in a&#10;cloak. The darkness, however, was now total; and we could only feel&#10;that he was standing in our midst. Before any one of us could&#10;recover from the extreme astonishment into which this rudeness had&#10;thrown all, we heard the voice of the intruder.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Gentlemen,&#34; he said, in a low, distinct, and&#10;never-to-be-forgotten whisper which thrilled to the very marrow of&#10;my bones, &#34;Gentlemen, I make no apology for this behaviour, because&#10;in thus behaving, I am but fulfilling a duty. You are, beyond&#10;doubt, uninformed of the true character of the person who has&#10;to-night won at ecarte a large sum of money from Lord Glendinning.&#10;I will therefore put you upon an expeditious and decisive plan of&#10;obtaining this very necessary information. Please to examine, at&#10;your leisure, the inner linings of the cuff of his left sleeve, and&#10;the several little packages which may be found in the somewhat&#10;capacious pockets of his embroidered morning wrapper.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;While he spoke, so profound was the stillness that one might&#10;have heard a pin drop upon the floor. In ceasing, he departed at&#10;once, and as abruptly as he had entered. Can I&#8212;shall I describe my&#10;sensations?&#8212;must I say that I felt all the horrors of the damned?&#10;Most assuredly I had little time given for reflection. Many hands&#10;roughly seized me upon the spot, and lights were immediately&#10;reprocured. A search ensued. In the lining of my sleeve were found&#10;all the court cards essential in ecarte, and, in the pockets of my&#10;wrapper, a number of packs, facsimiles of those used at our&#10;sittings, with the single exception that mine were of the species&#10;called, technically, arrondees; the honours being slightly convex&#10;at the ends, the lower cards slightly convex at the sides. In this&#10;disposition, the dupe who cuts, as customary, at the length of the&#10;pack, will invariably find that he cuts his antagonist an honor;&#10;while the gambler, cutting at the breadth, will, as certainly, cut&#10;nothing for his victim which may count in the records of the&#10;game.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Any burst of indignation upon this discovery would have affected&#10;me less than the silent contempt, or the sarcastic composure, with&#10;which it was received.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Mr. Wilson,&#34; said our host, stooping to remove from beneath his&#10;feet an exceedingly luxurious cloak of rare furs, &#34;Mr. Wilson, this&#10;is your property.&#34; (The weather was cold; and, upon quitting my own&#10;room, I had thrown a cloak over my dressing wrapper, putting it off&#10;upon reaching the scene of play.) &#34;I presume it is supererogatory&#10;to seek here (eyeing the folds of the garment with a bitter smile)&#10;for any farther evidence of your skill. Indeed, we have had enough.&#10;You will see the necessity, I hope, of quitting Oxford&#8212;at all&#10;events, of quitting instantly my chambers.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Abased, humbled to the dust as I then was, it is probable that I&#10;should have resented this galling language by immediate personal&#10;violence, had not my whole attention been at the moment arrested by&#10;a fact of the most startling character. The cloak which I had worn&#10;was of a rare description of fur; how rare, how extravagantly&#10;costly, I shall not venture to say. Its fashion, too, was of my own&#10;fantastic invention; for I was fastidious to an absurd degree of&#10;coxcombry, in matters of this frivolous nature. When, therefore,&#10;Mr. Preston reached me that which he had picked up upon the floor,&#10;and near the folding doors of the apartment, it was with an&#10;astonishment nearly bordering upon terror, that I perceived my own&#10;already hanging on my arm, (where I had no doubt unwittingly placed&#10;it,) and that the one presented me was but its exact counterpart in&#10;every, in even the minutest possible particular. The singular being&#10;who had so disastrously exposed me, had been muffled, I remembered,&#10;in a cloak; and none had been worn at all by any of the members of&#10;our party with the exception of myself. Retaining some presence of&#10;mind, I took the one offered me by Preston; placed it, unnoticed,&#10;over my own; left the apartment with a resolute scowl of defiance;&#10;and, next morning ere dawn of day, commenced a hurried journey from&#10;Oxford to the continent, in a perfect agony of horror and of&#10;shame.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I fled in vain. My evil destiny pursued me as if in exultation,&#10;and proved, indeed, that the exercise of its mysterious dominion&#10;had as yet only begun. Scarcely had I set foot in Paris ere I had&#10;fresh evidence of the detestable interest taken by this Wilson in&#10;my concerns. Years flew, while I experienced no relief. Villain!&#8212;at&#10;Rome, with how untimely, yet with how spectral an officiousness,&#10;stepped he in between me and my ambition! At Vienna, too&#8212;at&#10;Berlin&#8212;and at Moscow! Where, in truth, had I not bitter cause to&#10;curse him within my heart? From his inscrutable tyranny did I at&#10;length flee, panic-stricken, as from a pestilence; and to the very&#10;ends of the earth I fled in vain.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And again, and again, in secret communion with my own spirit,&#10;would I demand the questions &#34;Who is he?&#8212;whence came he?&#8212;and what&#10;are his objects?&#34; But no answer was there found. And then I&#10;scrutinized, with a minute scrutiny, the forms, and the methods,&#10;and the leading traits of his impertinent supervision. But even&#10;here there was very little upon which to base a conjecture. It was&#10;noticeable, indeed, that, in no one of the multiplied instances in&#10;which he had of late crossed my path, had he so crossed it except&#10;to frustrate those schemes, or to disturb those actions, which, if&#10;fully carried out, might have resulted in bitter mischief. Poor&#10;justification this, in truth, for an authority so imperiously&#10;assumed! Poor indemnity for natural rights of self-agency so&#10;pertinaciously, so insultingly denied!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I had also been forced to notice that my tormentor, for a very&#10;long period of time, (while scrupulously and with miraculous&#10;dexterity maintaining his whim of an identity of apparel with&#10;myself,) had so contrived it, in the execution of his varied&#10;interference with my will, that I saw not, at any moment, the&#10;features of his face. Be Wilson what he might, this, at least, was&#10;but the veriest of affectation, or of folly. Could he, for an&#10;instant, have supposed that, in my admonisher at Eton&#8212;in the&#10;destroyer of my honor at Oxford,&#8212;in him who thwarted my ambition at&#10;Rome, my revenge at Paris, my passionate love at Naples, or what he&#10;falsely termed my avarice in Egypt,&#8212;that in this, my arch-enemy and&#10;evil genius, could fall to recognise the William Wilson of my&#10;school boy days,&#8212;the namesake, the companion, the rival,&#8212;the hated&#10;and dreaded rival at Dr. Bransby&#39;s? Impossible!&#8212;But let me hasten&#10;to the last eventful scene of the drama.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Thus far I had succumbed supinely to this imperious domination.&#10;The sentiment of deep awe with which I habitually regarded the&#10;elevated character, the majestic wisdom, the apparent omnipresence&#10;and omnipotence of Wilson, added to a feeling of even terror, with&#10;which certain other traits in his nature and assumptions inspired&#10;me, had operated, hitherto, to impress me with an idea of my own&#10;utter weakness and helplessness, and to suggest an implicit,&#10;although bitterly reluctant submission to his arbitrary will. But,&#10;of late days, I had given myself up entirely to wine; and its&#10;maddening influence upon my hereditary temper rendered me more and&#10;more impatient of control. I began to murmur,&#8212;to hesitate,&#8212;to&#10;resist. And was it only fancy which induced me to believe that,&#10;with the increase of my own firmness, that of my tormentor&#10;underwent a proportional diminution? Be this as it may, I now began&#10;to feel the inspiration of a burning hope, and at length nurtured&#10;in my secret thoughts a stern and desperate resolution that I would&#10;submit no longer to be enslaved.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was at Rome, during the Carnival of 18&#8212;, that I attended a&#10;masquerade in the palazzo of the Neapolitan Duke Di Broglio. I had&#10;indulged more freely than usual in the excesses of the wine-table;&#10;and now the suffocating atmosphere of the crowded rooms irritated&#10;me beyond endurance. The difficulty, too, of forcing my way through&#10;the mazes of the company contributed not a little to the ruffling&#10;of my temper; for I was anxiously seeking, (let me not say with&#10;what unworthy motive) the young, the gay, the beautiful wife of the&#10;aged and doting Di Broglio. With a too unscrupulous confidence she&#10;had previously communicated to me the secret of the costume in&#10;which she would be habited, and now, having caught a glimpse of her&#10;person, I was hurrying to make my way into her presence.&#8212;At this&#10;moment I felt a light hand placed upon my shoulder, and that&#10;ever-remembered, low, damnable whisper within my ear.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In an absolute phrenzy of wrath, I turned at once upon him who&#10;had thus interrupted me, and seized him violently by tile collar.&#10;He was attired, as I had expected, in a costume altogether similar&#10;to my own; wearing a Spanish cloak of blue velvet, begirt about the&#10;waist with a crimson belt sustaining a rapier. A mask of black silk&#10;entirely covered his face.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Scoundrel!&#34; I said, in a voice husky with rage, while every&#10;syllable I uttered seemed as new fuel to my fury, &#34;scoundrel!&#10;impostor! accursed villain! you shall not&#8212;you shall not dog me unto&#10;death! Follow me, or I stab you where you stand!&#34;&#8212;and I broke my&#10;way from the ball-room into a small ante-chamber adjoining&#8212;dragging&#10;him unresistingly with me as I went.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Upon entering, I thrust him furiously from me. He staggered&#10;against the wall, while I closed the door with an oath, and&#10;commanded him to draw. He hesitated but for an instant; then, with&#10;a slight sigh, drew in silence, and put himself upon his&#10;defence.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The contest was brief indeed. I was frantic with every species&#10;of wild excitement, and felt within my single arm the energy and&#10;power of a multitude. In a few seconds I forced him by sheer&#10;strength against the wainscoting, and thus, getting him at mercy,&#10;plunged my sword, with brute ferocity, repeatedly through and&#10;through his bosom.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At that instant some person tried the latch of the door. I&#10;hastened to prevent an intrusion, and then immediately returned to&#10;my dying antagonist. But what human language can adequately portray&#10;that astonishment, that horror which possessed me at the spectacle&#10;then presented to view? The brief moment in which I averted my eyes&#10;had been sufficient to produce, apparently, a material change in&#10;the arrangements at the upper or farther end of the room. A large&#10;mirror,&#8212;so at first it seemed to me in my confusion&#8212;now stood where&#10;none had been perceptible before; and, as I stepped up to it in&#10;extremity of terror, mine own image, but with features all pale and&#10;dabbled in blood, advanced to meet me with a feeble and tottering&#10;gait.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Thus it appeared, I say, but was not. It was my antagonist&#8212;it&#10;was Wilson, who then stood before me in the agonies of his&#10;dissolution. His mask and cloak lay, where he had thrown them, upon&#10;the floor. Not a thread in all his raiment&#8212;not a line in all the&#10;marked and singular lineaments of his face which was not, even in&#10;the most absolute identity, mine own!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was Wilson; but he spoke no longer in a whisper, and I could&#10;have fancied that I myself was speaking while he said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You have conquered, and I yield. Yet, henceforward art thou&#10;also dead&#8212;dead to the World, to Heaven and to Hope! In me didst&#10;thou exist&#8212;and, in my death, see by this image, which is thine own,&#10;how utterly thou hast murdered thyself.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 1, :source => 'feedbooks')

B. C. Smith. Some one did introduce me to the&#10;gentleman, I am sure&#8212;at some public meeting, I know very well&#8212;held&#10;about something of great importance, no doubt&#8212;at some place or&#10;other, I feel convinced, whose name I have unaccountably forgotten.&#10;The truth is&#8212;that the introduction was attended, upon my part, with&#10;a degree of anxious embarrassment which operated to prevent any&#10;definite impressions of either time or place. I am constitutionally&#10;nervous- this, with me, is a family failing, and I can&#39;t help it.&#10;In especial, the slightest appearance of mystery&#8212;of any point I&#10;cannot exactly comprehend&#8212;puts me at once into a pitiable state of&#10;agitation.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There was something, as it were, remarkable&#8212;yes, remarkable,&#10;although this is but a feeble term to express my full meaning&#8212;about&#10;the entire individuality of the personage in question. He was,&#10;perhaps, six feet in height, and of a presence singularly&#10;commanding. There was an air distingue pervading the whole man,&#10;which spoke of high breeding, and hinted at high birth. Upon this&#10;topic&#8212;the topic of Smith&#39;s personal appearance&#8212;I have a kind of&#10;melancholy satisfaction in being minute. His head of hair would&#10;have done honor to a Brutus,&#8212;nothing could be more richly flowing,&#10;or possess a brighter gloss. It was of a jetty black,&#8212;which was&#10;also the color, or more properly the no-color of his unimaginable&#10;whiskers. You perceive I cannot speak of these latter without&#10;enthusiasm; it is not too much to say that they were the handsomest&#10;pair of whiskers under the sun. At all events, they encircled, and&#10;at times partially overshadowed, a mouth utterly unequalled. Here&#10;were the most entirely even, and the most brilliantly white of all&#10;conceivable teeth. From between them, upon every proper occasion,&#10;issued a voice of surpassing clearness, melody, and strength. In&#10;the matter of eyes, also, my acquaintance was pre-eminently&#10;endowed. Either one of such a pair was worth a couple of the&#10;ordinary ocular organs. They were of a deep hazel exceedingly large&#10;and lustrous; and there was perceptible about them, ever and anon,&#10;just that amount of interesting obliquity which gives pregnancy to&#10;expression.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The bust of the General was unquestionably the finest bust I&#10;ever saw. For your life you could not have found a fault with its&#10;wonderful proportion. This rare peculiarity set off to great&#10;advantage a pair of shoulders which would have called up a blush of&#10;conscious inferiority into the countenance of the marble Apollo. I&#10;have a passion for fine shoulders, and may say that I never beheld&#10;them in perfection before. The arms altogether were admirably&#10;modelled. Nor were the lower limbs less superb. These were, indeed,&#10;the ne plus ultra of good legs. Every connoisseur in such matters&#10;admitted the legs to be good. There was neither too much flesh nor&#10;too little,- neither rudeness nor fragility. I could not imagine a&#10;more graceful curve than that of the os femoris, and there was just&#10;that due gentle prominence in the rear of the fibula which goes to&#10;the conformation of a properly proportioned calf. I wish to God my&#10;young and talented friend Chiponchipino, the sculptor, had but seen&#10;the legs of Brevet Brigadier General John A. B. C. Smith.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But although men so absolutely fine-looking are neither as&#10;plenty as reasons or blackberries, still I could not bring myself&#10;to believe that the remarkable something to which I alluded just&#10;now,&#8212;that the odd air of je ne sais quoi which hung about my new&#10;acquaintance,&#8212;lay altogether, or indeed at all, in the supreme&#10;excellence of his bodily endowments. Perhaps it might be traced to&#10;the manner,&#8212;yet here again I could not pretend to be positive.&#10;There was a primness, not to say stiffness, in his carriage&#8212;a&#10;degree of measured and, if I may so express it, of rectangular&#10;precision attending his every movement, which, observed in a more&#10;diminutive figure, would have had the least little savor in the&#10;world of affectation, pomposity, or constraint, but which, noticed&#10;in a gentleman of his undoubted dimensions, was readily placed to&#10;the account of reserve, hauteur- of a commendable sense, in short,&#10;of what is due to the dignity of colossal proportion.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The kind friend who presented me to General Smith whispered in&#10;my ear some few words of comment upon the man. He was a remarkable&#10;man&#8212;a very remarkable man&#8212;indeed one of the most remarkable men of&#10;the age. He was an especial favorite, too, with the ladies&#8212;chiefly&#10;on account of his high reputation for courage.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;In that point he is unrivalled&#8212;indeed he is a perfect&#10;desperado&#8212;a downright fire-eater, and no mistake,&#34; said my friend,&#10;here dropping his voice excessively low, and thrilling me with the&#10;mystery of his tone.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;A downright fire-eater, and no mistake. Showed that, I should&#10;say, to some purpose, in the late tremendous swamp-fight, away down&#10;South, with the Bugaboo and Kickapoo Indians.&#34; [Here my friend&#10;opened his eyes to some extent.] &#34;Bless my soul!&#8212;blood and thunder,&#10;and all that!&#8212;prodigies of valor!&#8212;heard of him of course?&#8212;you know&#10;he&#39;s the man&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Man alive, how do you do? why, how are ye? very glad to see ye,&#10;indeed!&#34; here interrupted the General himself, seizing my companion&#10;by the hand as he drew near, and bowing stiffly but profoundly, as&#10;I was presented. I then thought (and I think so still) that I never&#10;heard a clearer nor a stronger voice, nor beheld a finer set of&#10;teeth: but I must say that I was sorry for the interruption just at&#10;that moment, as, owing to the whispers and insinuations aforesaid,&#10;my interest had been greatly excited in the hero of the Bugaboo and&#10;Kickapoo campaign.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;However, the delightfully luminous conversation of Brevet&#10;Brigadier General John A. B. C. Smith soon completely dissipated&#10;this chagrin. My friend leaving us immediately, we had quite a long&#10;tete-a-tete, and I was not only pleased but really-instructed. I&#10;never heard a more fluent talker, or a man of greater general&#10;information. With becoming modesty, he forebore, nevertheless, to&#10;touch upon the theme I had just then most at heart&#8212;I mean the&#10;mysterious circumstances attending the Bugaboo war&#8212;and, on my own&#10;part, what I conceive to be a proper sense of delicacy forbade me&#10;to broach the subject; although, in truth, I was exceedingly&#10;tempted to do so. I perceived, too, that the gallant soldier&#10;preferred topics of philosophical interest, and that he delighted,&#10;especially, in commenting upon the rapid march of mechanical&#10;invention. Indeed, lead him where I would, this was a point to&#10;which he invariably came back.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;There is nothing at all like it,&#34; he would say, &#34;we are a&#10;wonderful people, and live in a wonderful age. Parachutes and&#10;rail-roads-mantraps and spring-guns! Our steam-boats are upon every&#10;sea, and the Nassau balloon packet is about to run regular trips&#10;(fare either way only twenty pounds sterling) between London and&#10;Timbuctoo. And who shall calculate the immense influence upon&#10;social life&#8212;upon arts&#8212;upon commerce&#8212;upon literature&#8212;which will be&#10;the immediate result of the great principles of electro-magnetics!&#10;Nor, is this all, let me assure you! There is really no end to the&#10;march of invention. The most wonderful&#8212;the most ingenious&#8212;and let&#10;me add, Mr.&#8212;Mr.&#8212;Thompson, I believe, is your name&#8212;let me add, I say&#10;the most useful&#8212;the most truly useful&#8212;mechanical contrivances are&#10;daily springing up like mushrooms, if I may so express myself, or,&#10;more figuratively, like&#8212;ah&#8212;grasshoppers&#8212;like grasshoppers, Mr.&#10;Thompson&#8212;about us and ah&#8212;ah&#8212;ah&#8212;around us!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Thompson, to be sure, is not my name; but it is needless to say&#10;that I left General Smith with a heightened interest in the man,&#10;with an exalted opinion of his conversational powers, and a deep&#10;sense of the valuable privileges we enjoy in living in this age of&#10;mechanical invention. My curiosity, however, had not been&#10;altogether satisfied, and I resolved to prosecute immediate inquiry&#10;among my acquaintances, touching the Brevet Brigadier General&#10;himself, and particularly respecting the tremendous events quorum&#10;pars magna fuit, during the Bugaboo and Kickapoo campaign.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The first opportunity which presented opportunity which&#10;presented itself, and which (horresco referens) I did not in the&#10;least scruple to seize, occurred at the Church of the Reverend&#10;Doctor Drummummupp, where I found myself established, one Sunday,&#10;just at sermon time, not only in the pew, but by the side of that&#10;worthy and communicative little friend of mine, Miss Tabitha T.&#10;Thus seated, I congratulated myself, and with much reason, upon the&#10;very flattering state of affairs. If any person knew any thing&#10;about Brevet Brigadier General John A. B. C. Smith, that person it&#10;was clear to me, was Miss Tabitha T. We telegraphed a few signals&#10;and then commenced, soto voce, a brisk tete-a-tete.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Smith!&#34; said she in reply to my very earnest inquiry:&#10;&#34;Smith!&#8212;why, not General John A. B. C.? Bless me, I thought you&#10;knew all about him! This is a wonderfully inventive age! Horrid&#10;affair that!&#8212;a bloody set of wretches, those Kickapoos!&#8212;fought like&#10;a hero&#8212;prodigies of valor&#8212; immortal renown. Smith!&#8212;Brevet Brigadier&#10;General John A. B. C.! Why, you know he&#39;s the man&#8212;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Man,&#34; here broke in Doctor Drummummupp, at the top of his&#10;voice, and with a thump that came near knocking the pulpit about&#10;our ears; &#34;man that is born of a woman hath but a short time to&#10;live; he cometh up and is cut down like a flower!&#34; I started to the&#10;extremity of the pew, and perceived by the animated looks of the&#10;divine, that the wrath which had nearly proved fatal to the pulpit&#10;had been excited by the whispers of the lady and myself. There was&#10;no help for it; so I submitted with a good grace, and listened, in&#10;all the martyrdom of dignified silence, to the balance of that very&#10;capital discourse.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Next evening found me a somewhat late visitor at the Rantipole&#10;Theatre, where I felt sure of satisfying my curiosity at once, by&#10;merely stepping into the box of those exquisite specimens of&#10;affability and omniscience, the Misses Arabella and Miranda&#10;Cognoscenti. That fine tragedian, Climax, was doing Iago to a very&#10;crowded house, and I experienced some little difficulty in making&#10;my wishes understood; especially as our box was next the slips, and&#10;completely overlooked the stage.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Smith!&#34; said Miss Arabella, as she at comprehended the purport&#10;of my query; &#34;Smith?&#8212;why, not General John A. B. C.?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Smith!&#34; inquired Miranda, musingly. &#34;God bless me, did you ever&#10;behold a finer figure?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Never, madam, but do tell me&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Or so inimitable grace?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Never, upon my word!&#8212;But pray, inform me&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Or so just an appreciation of stage effect?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Madam!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Or a more delicate sense of the true beauties of Shakespeare?&#10;Be so good as to look at that leg!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The devil!&#34; and I turned again to her sister.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Smith!&#34; said she, &#34;why, not General John A. B. C.? Horrid&#10;affair that, wasn&#39;t it?&#8212;great wretches, those Bugaboos&#8212;savage and&#10;so on- but we live in a wonderfully inventive age!&#8212;Smith!&#8212;O yes!&#10;great man!&#8212;perfect desperado&#8212;immortal renown&#8212;prodigies of valor!&#10;Never heard!&#34; [This was given in a scream.] &#34;Bless my soul! why,&#10;he&#39;s the man&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;-mandragora&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Which thou ow&#39;dst yesterday!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;here roared our Climax just in my ear, and shaking his fist in&#10;my face all the time, in a way that I couldn&#39;t stand, and I&#10;wouldn&#39;t. I left the Misses Cognoscenti immediately, went behind&#10;the scenes forthwith, and gave the beggarly scoundrel such a&#10;thrashing as I trust he will remember till the day of his&#10;death.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At the soiree of the lovely widow, Mrs. Kathleen O&#39;Trump, I was&#10;confident that I should meet with no similar disappointment.&#10;Accordingly, I was no sooner seated at the card-table, with my&#10;pretty hostess for a vis-a-vis, than I propounded those questions&#10;the solution of which had become a matter so essential to my&#10;peace.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Smith!&#34; said my partner, &#34;why, not General John A. B. C.?&#10;Horrid affair that, wasn&#39;t it?&#8212;diamonds did you say?&#8212;terrible&#10;wretches those Kickapoos!&#8212;we are playing whist, if you please, Mr.&#10;Tattle- however, this is the age of invention, most certainly the&#10;age, one may say&#8212;the age par excellence&#8212;speak French?&#8212;oh, quite a&#10;hero&#8212;perfect desperado!&#8212;no hearts, Mr. Tattle? I don&#39;t believe&#10;it!&#8212;Immortal renown and all that!&#8212;prodigies of valor! Never&#10;heard!!&#8212;why, bless me, he&#39;s the man-&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Mann?&#8212;Captain Mann!&#34; here screamed some little feminine&#10;interloper from the farthest corner of the room. &#34;Are you talking&#10;about Captain Mann and the duel?&#8212;oh, I must hear&#8212;do tell&#8212;go on,&#10;Mrs. O&#39;Trump!&#8212;do now go on!&#34; And go on Mrs. O&#39;Trump did&#8212;all about a&#10;certain Captain Mann, who was either shot or hung, or should have&#10;been both shot and hung. Yes! Mrs. O&#39;Trump, she went on, and I&#8212;I&#10;went off. There was no chance of hearing any thing farther that&#10;evening in regard to Brevet Brigadier General John A. B. C.&#10;Smith.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Still I consoled myself with the reflection that the tide of&#10;ill-luck would not run against me forever, and so determined to&#10;make a bold push for information at the rout of that bewitching&#10;little angel, the graceful Mrs. Pirouette.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Smith!&#34; said Mrs. P., as we twirled about together in a pas de&#10;zephyr, &#34;Smith?&#8212;why, not General John A. B. C.? Dreadful business&#10;that of the Bugaboos, wasn&#39;t it?&#8212;dreadful creatures, those&#10;Indians!&#8212;do turn out your toes! I really am ashamed of you&#8212;man of&#10;great courage, poor fellow!&#8212;but this is a wonderful age for&#10;invention&#8212;O dear me, I&#39;m out of breath&#8212;quite a desperado- prodigies&#10;of valor&#8212;never heard!!&#8212;can&#39;t believe it&#8212;I shall have to sit down&#10;and enlighten you&#8212;Smith! why, he&#39;s the man&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Man-Fred, I tell you!&#34; here bawled out Miss Bas-Bleu, as I led&#10;Mrs. Pirouette to a seat. &#34;Did ever anybody hear the like? It&#39;s&#10;Man-Fred, I say, and not at all by any means Man-Friday.&#34; Here Miss&#10;Bas-Bleu beckoned to me in a very peremptory manner; and I was&#10;obliged, will I nill I, to leave Mrs. P. for the purpose of&#10;deciding a dispute touching the title of a certain poetical drama&#10;of Lord Byron&#39;s. Although I pronounced, with great promptness, that&#10;the true title was Man-Friday, and not by any means Man-Fred yet&#10;when I returned to seek Mrs. Pirouette she was not to be&#10;discovered, and I made my retreat from the house in a very bitter&#10;spirit of animosity against the whole race of the Bas-Bleus.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Matters had now assumed a really serious aspect, and I resolved&#10;to call at once upon my particular friend, Mr. Theodore Sinivate;&#10;for I knew that here at least I should get something like definite&#10;information.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Smith!&#34; said he, in his well known peculiar way of drawling out&#10;his syllables; &#34;Smith!&#8212;why, not General John A. B. C.? Savage&#10;affair that with the Kickapo-o-o-os, wasn&#39;t it? Say, don&#39;t you&#10;think so?- perfect despera-a-ado&#8212;great pity, &#39;pon my&#10;honor!&#8212;wonderfully inventive age!&#8212;pro-o-digies of valor! By the by,&#10;did you ever hear about Captain Ma-a-a-a-n?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Captain Mann be d-d!&#34; said I; &#34;please to go on with your&#10;story.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Hem!&#8212;oh well!&#8212;quite la meme cho-o-ose, as we say in France.&#10;Smith, eh? Brigadier-General John A. B. C.? I say&#34;&#8212;[here Mr. S.&#10;thought proper to put his finger to the side of his nose]&#8212;&#34;I say,&#10;you don&#39;t mean to insinuate now, really and truly, and&#10;conscientiously, that you don&#39;t know all about that affair of&#10;Smith&#39;s, as well as I do, eh? Smith? John A-B-C.? Why, bless me,&#10;he&#39;s the ma-a-an-&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Mr. Sinivate,&#34; said I, imploringly, &#34;is he the man in the&#10;mask?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No-o-o!&#34; said he, looking wise, &#34;nor the man in the&#10;mo-o-on.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;This reply I considered a pointed and positive insult, and so&#10;left the house at once in high dudgeon, with a firm resolve to call&#10;my friend, Mr. Sinivate, to a speedy account for his ungentlemanly&#10;conduct and ill breeding.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In the meantime, however, I had no notion of being thwarted&#10;touching the information I desired. There was one resource left me&#10;yet. I would go to the fountain head. I would call forthwith upon&#10;the General himself, and demand, in explicit terms, a solution of&#10;this abominable piece of mystery. Here, at least, there should be&#10;no chance for equivocation. I would be plain, positive,&#10;peremptory&#8212;as short as pie-crust&#8212;as concise as Tacitus or&#10;Montesquieu.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was early when I called, and the General was dressing, but I&#10;pleaded urgent business, and was shown at once into his bedroom by&#10;an old negro valet, who remained in attendance during my visit. As&#10;I entered the chamber, I looked about, of course, for the occupant,&#10;but did not immediately perceive him. There was a large and&#10;exceedingly odd looking bundle of something which lay close by my&#10;feet on the floor, and, as I was not in the best humor in the&#10;world, I gave it a kick out of the way.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Hem! ahem! rather civil that, I should say!&#34; said the bundle,&#10;in one of the smallest, and altogether the funniest little voices,&#10;between a squeak and a whistle, that I ever heard in all the days&#10;of my existence.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ahem! rather civil that I should observe.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I fairly shouted with terror, and made off, at a tangent, into&#10;the farthest extremity of the room.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;God bless me, my dear fellow!&#34; here again whistled the bundle,&#10;&#34;what&#8212;what&#8212;what&#8212;why, what is the matter? I really believe you don&#39;t&#10;know me at all.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;What could I say to all this&#8212;what could I? I staggered into an&#10;armchair, and, with staring eyes and open mouth, awaited the&#10;solution of the wonder.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Strange you shouldn&#39;t know me though, isn&#39;t it?&#34; presently&#10;resqueaked the nondescript, which I now perceived was performing&#10;upon the floor some inexplicable evolution, very analogous to the&#10;drawing on of a stocking. There was only a single leg, however,&#10;apparent.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Strange you shouldn&#39;t know me though, isn&#39;t it? Pompey, bring&#10;me that leg!&#34; Here Pompey handed the bundle a very capital cork&#10;leg, already dressed, which it screwed on in a trice; and then it&#10;stood upright before my eyes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And a bloody action it was,&#34; continued the thing, as if in a&#10;soliloquy; &#34;but then one mustn&#39;t fight with the Bugaboos and&#10;Kickapoos, and think of coming off with a mere scratch. Pompey,&#10;I&#39;ll thank you now for that arm. Thomas&#34; [turning to me] &#34;is&#10;decidedly the best hand at a cork leg; but if you should ever want&#10;an arm, my dear fellow, you must really let me recommend you to&#10;Bishop.&#34; Here Pompey screwed on an arm.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;We had rather hot work of it, that you may say. Now, you dog,&#10;slip on my shoulders and bosom. Pettit makes the best shoulders,&#10;but for a bosom you will have to go to Ducrow.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Bosom!&#34; said I.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Pompey, will you never be ready with that wig? Scalping is a&#10;rough process, after all; but then you can procure such a capital&#10;scratch at De L&#39;Orme&#39;s.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Scratch!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Now, you nigger, my teeth! For a good set of these you had&#10;better go to Parmly&#39;s at once; high prices, but excellent work. I&#10;swallowed some very capital articles, though, when the big Bugaboo&#10;rammed me down with the butt end of his rifle.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Butt end! ram down!! my eye!!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O yes, by the way, my eye&#8212;here, Pompey, you scamp, screw it in!&#10;Those Kickapoos are not so very slow at a gouge; but he&#39;s a belied&#10;man, that Dr. Williams, after all; you can&#39;t imagine how well I see&#10;with the eyes of his make.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I now began very clearly to perceive that the object before me&#10;was nothing more nor less than my new acquaintance, Brevet&#10;Brigadier General John A. B. C. Smith. The manipulations of Pompey&#10;had made, I must confess, a very striking difference in the&#10;appearance of the personal man. The voice, however, still puzzled&#10;me no little; but even this apparent mystery was speedily cleared&#10;up.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Pompey, you black rascal,&#34; squeaked the General, &#34;I really do&#10;believe you would let me go out without my palate.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Hereupon, the negro, grumbling out an apology, went up to his&#10;master, opened his mouth with the knowing air of a horse-jockey,&#10;and adjusted therein a somewhat singular-looking machine, in a very&#10;dexterous manner, that I could not altogether comprehend. The&#10;alteration, however, in the entire expression of the General&#39;s&#10;countenance was instantaneous and surprising. When he again spoke,&#10;his voice had resumed all that rich melody and strength which I had&#10;noticed upon our original introduction.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;D-n the vagabonds!&#34; said he, in so clear a tone that I&#10;positively started at the change, &#34;D-n the vagabonds! they not only&#10;knocked in the roof of my mouth, but took the trouble to cut off at&#10;least seven-eighths of my tongue. There isn&#39;t Bonfanti&#39;s equal,&#10;however, in America, for really good articles of this description.&#10;I can recommend you to him with confidence,&#34; [here the General&#10;bowed,] &#34;and assure you that I have the greatest pleasure in so&#10;doing.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I acknowledged his kindness in my best manner, and took leave of&#10;him at once, with a perfect understanding of the true state of&#10;affairs- with a full comprehension of the mystery which had&#10;troubled me so long. It was evident. It was a clear case. Brevet&#10;Brigadier General John A. B. C. Smith was the man&#8212;the man that was&#10;used up.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 1, :source => 'feedbooks')

I know not how it was; but, with the first glimpse&#10;of the building, a sense of insufferable gloom pervaded my spirit.&#10;I say insufferable; for the feeling was unrelieved by any of that&#10;half-pleasurable, because poetic, sentiment, with which the mind&#10;usually receives even the sternest natural images of the desolate&#10;or terrible. I looked upon the scene before me&#8212;upon the mere house,&#10;and the simple landscape features of the domain&#8212;upon the bleak&#10;walls&#8212;upon the vacant eye-like windows&#8212;upon a few rank sedges&#8212;and&#10;upon a few white trunks of decayed trees&#8212;with an utter depression&#10;of soul which I can compare to no earthly sensation more properly&#10;than to the after-dream of the reveler upon opium&#8212;the bitter lapse&#10;into every-day life&#8212;the hideous dropping off of the veil. There was&#10;an iciness, a sinking, a sickening of the heart&#8212;an unredeemed&#10;dreariness of thought which no goading of the imagination could&#10;torture into aught of the sublime. What was it&#8212;I paused to&#10;think&#8212;what was it that so unnerved me in the contemplation of the&#10;House of Usher? It was a mystery all insoluble; nor could I grapple&#10;with the shadowy fancies that crowded upon me as I pondered. I was&#10;forced to fall back upon the unsatisfactory conclusion that while,&#10;beyond doubt, there are combinations of very simple natural objects&#10;which have the power of thus affecting us, still the analysis of&#10;this power lies among considerations beyond our depth. It was&#10;possible, I reflected, that a mere different arrangement of the&#10;particulars of the scene, of the details of the picture, would be&#10;sufficient to modify, or perhaps to annihilate its capacity for&#10;sorrowful impression; and, acting upon this idea, I reined my horse&#10;to the precipitous brink of a black and lurid tarn that lay in&#10;unruffled luster by the dwelling, and gazed down&#8212;but with a shudder&#10;even more thrilling than before&#8212;upon the remodeled and inverted&#10;images of the gray sedge, and the ghastly tree stems, and the&#10;vacant and eye-like windows.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Nevertheless, in this mansion of gloom I now proposed to myself&#10;a sojourn of some weeks. Its proprietor, Roderick Usher, had been&#10;one of my boon companions in boyhood; but many years had elapsed&#10;since our last meeting. A letter, however, had lately reached me in&#10;a distant part of the country&#8212;a letter from him&#8212;which, in its&#10;wildly importunate nature, had admitted of no other than a personal&#10;reply. The MS. gave evidence of nervous agitation. The writer spoke&#10;of acute bodily illness, of a mental disorder which oppressed him,&#10;and of an earnest desire to see me, as his best, and indeed his&#10;only personal friend, with a view of attempting, by the&#10;cheerfulness of my society, some alleviation of his malady. It was&#10;the manner in which all this, and much more, was said&#8212;it was the&#10;apparent heart that went with his request&#8212;which allowed me no room&#10;for hesitation; and I accordingly obeyed forthwith what I still&#10;considered a very singular summons.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Although, as boys, we had been even intimate associates, yet I&#10;really knew little of my friend. His reserve had been always&#10;excessive and habitual. I was aware, however, that his very ancient&#10;family had been noted, time out of mind, for a peculiar sensibility&#10;of temperament, displaying itself, through long ages, in many works&#10;of exalted art, and manifested, of late, in repeated deeds of&#10;munificent, yet unobtrusive charity, as well as in a passionate&#10;devotion to the intricacies, perhaps even more than to the orthodox&#10;and easily recognizable beauties, of musical science. I had&#10;learned, too, the very remarkable fact that the stem of the Usher&#10;race, all time-honored as it was, had put forth, at no period, any&#10;enduring branch; in other words, that the entire family lay in the&#10;direct line of descent, and had always, with very trifling and very&#10;temporary variation, so lain. It was this deficiency, I considered,&#10;while running over in thought the perfect keeping of the character&#10;of the premises with the accredited character of the people, and&#10;while speculating upon the possible influence which the one, in the&#10;long lapse of centuries, might have exercised upon the other&#8212;it was&#10;this deficiency, perhaps, of collateral issue, and the consequent&#10;undeviating transmission, from sire to son, of the patrimony with&#10;the name, which had, at length, so identified the two as to merge&#10;the original title of the estate in the quaint and equivocal&#10;appellation of the &#8220;House of Usher&#8221;&#8212;an appellation which seemed to&#10;include, in the minds of the peasantry who used it, both the family&#10;and the family mansion.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I have said that the sole effect of my somewhat childish&#10;experiment of looking down within the tarn had been to deepen the&#10;first singular impression. There can be no doubt that the&#10;consciousness of the rapid increase of my superstition&#8212;for why&#10;should I not so term it?&#8212;served mainly to accelerate the increase&#10;itself. Such, I have long known, is the paradoxical law of all&#10;sentiments having terror as a basis. And it might have been for&#10;this reason only, that, when I again uplifted my eyes to the house&#10;itself, from its image in the pool, there grew in my mind a strange&#10;fancy&#8212;a fancy so ridiculous, indeed, that I but mention it to show&#10;the vivid force of the sensations which oppressed me. I had so&#10;worked upon my imagination as really to believe that about the&#10;whole mansion and domain there hung an atmosphere peculiar to&#10;themselves and their immediate vicinity&#8212;an atmosphere which had no&#10;affinity with the air of heaven, but which had reeked up from the&#10;decayed trees, and the gray wall, and the silent tarn&#8212;a pestilent&#10;and mystic vapor, dull, sluggish, faintly discernible, and&#10;leaden-hued.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Shaking off from my spirit what must have been a dream, I&#10;scanned more narrowly the real aspect of the building. Its&#10;principal feature seemed to be that of an excessive antiquity. The&#10;discoloration of ages had been great. Minute fungi overspread the&#10;whole exterior, hanging in a fine, tangled web-work from the eaves.&#10;Yet all this was apart from any extraordinary dilapidation. No&#10;portion of the masonry had fallen; and there appeared to be a wild&#10;inconsistency between its still perfect adaptation of parts, and&#10;the crumbling condition of the individual stones. In this there was&#10;much that reminded me of the specious totality of old woodwork&#10;which has rotted for years in some neglected vault, with no&#10;disturbance from the breath of the external air. Beyond this&#10;indication of extensive decay, however, the fabric gave little&#10;token of instability. Perhaps the eye of a scrutinizing observer&#10;might have discovered a barely perceptible fissure, which,&#10;extending from the roof of the building in front, made its way down&#10;the wall in a zigzag direction, until it became lost in the sullen&#10;waters of the tarn.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Noticing these things, I rode over a short causeway to the&#10;house. A servant in waiting took my horse, and I entered the Gothic&#10;archway of the hall. A valet, of stealthy step, thence conducted&#10;me, in silence, through many dark and intricate passages in my&#10;progress to the studio of his master. Much that I encountered on&#10;the way contributed, I know not how, to heighten the vague&#10;sentiments of which I have already spoken. While the objects around&#10;me&#8212;while the carvings of the ceilings, the somber tapestries of the&#10;walls, the ebon blackness of the floors, and the phantasmagoric&#10;armorial trophies which rattled as I strode, were but matters to&#10;which, or to such as which, I had been accustomed from my&#10;infancy&#8212;while I hesitated not to acknowledge how familiar was all&#10;this&#8212;I still wondered to find how unfamiliar were the fancies which&#10;ordinary images were stirring up. On one of the staircases I met&#10;the physician of the family. His countenance, I thought, wore a&#10;mingled expression of low cunning and perplexity. He accosted me&#10;with trepidation and passed on. The valet now threw open a door and&#10;ushered me into the presence of his master.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The room in which I found myself was very large and lofty. The&#10;windows were long, narrow, and pointed, and at so vast a distance&#10;from the black oaken floor as to be altogether inaccessible from&#10;within. Feeble gleams of encrimsoned light made their way through&#10;the trellised panes, and served to render sufficiently distinct the&#10;more prominent objects around; the eye, however, struggled in vain&#10;to reach the remoter angles of the chamber, or the recesses of the&#10;vaulted and fretted ceiling. Dark draperies hung upon the walls.&#10;The general furniture was profuse, comfortless, antique, and&#10;tattered. Many books and musical instruments lay scattered about,&#10;but failed to give any vitality to the scene. I felt that I&#10;breathed an atmosphere of sorrow. An air of stern, deep, and&#10;irredeemable gloom hung over and pervaded all.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Upon my entrance, Usher arose from a sofa on which he had been&#10;lying at full length, and greeted me with a vivacious warmth which&#10;had much in it, I at first thought, of an overdone cordiality&#8212;of&#10;the constrained effort of the ennuy&#233; man of the world. A glance,&#10;however, at his countenance convinced me of his perfect sincerity.&#10;We sat down; and for some moments, while he spoke not, I gazed upon&#10;him with a feeling half of pity, half of awe. Surely, man had never&#10;before so terribly altered, in so brief a period, as had Roderick&#10;Usher! It was with difficulty that I could bring myself to admit&#10;the identity of the wan being before me with the companion of my&#10;early boyhood. Yet the character of his face had been at all times&#10;remarkable. A cadaverousness of complexion; an eye large, liquid,&#10;and luminous beyond comparison; lips somewhat thin and very pallid,&#10;but of a surpassingly beautiful curve; a nose of a delicate Hebrew&#10;model, but with a breadth of nostril unusual in similar formations;&#10;a finely molded chin, speaking, in its want of prominence, of a&#10;want of moral energy; hair of a more than web-like softness and&#10;tenuity; these features, with an inordinate expansion above the&#10;regions of the temple, made up altogether a countenance not easily&#10;to be forgotten. And now in the mere exaggeration of the prevailing&#10;character of these features, and of the expression they were wont&#10;to convey, lay so much of change that I doubted to whom I spoke.&#10;The now ghastly pallor of the skin, and the now miraculous luster&#10;of the eye, above all things startled and even awed me. The silken&#10;hair, too, had been suffered to grow all unheeded, and as, in its&#10;wild gossamer texture, it floated rather than fell about the face,&#10;I could not, even with effort, connect its arabesque expression&#10;with any idea of simple humanity.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In the manner of my friend I was at once struck with an&#10;incoherence&#8212;an inconsistency; and I soon found this to arise from a&#10;series of feeble and futile struggles to overcome an habitual&#10;trepidancy, an excessive nervous agitation. For something of this&#10;nature I had indeed been prepared, no less by his letter than by&#10;reminiscences of certain boyish traits, and by conclusions deduced&#10;from his peculiar physical conformation and temperament. His action&#10;was alternately vivacious and sullen. His voice varied rapidly from&#10;a tremulous indecision (when the animal spirits seemed utterly in&#10;abeyance) to that species of energetic concision&#8212;that abrupt,&#10;weighty, unhurried, and hollow-sounding enunciation&#8212;that leaden,&#10;self-balanced, and perfectly modulated guttural utterance, which&#10;may be observed in the lost drunkard, or the irreclaimable eater of&#10;opium, during the periods of his most intense excitement.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was thus that he spoke of the object of my visit, of his&#10;earnest desire to see me, and of the solace he expected me to&#10;afford him. He entered, at some length, into what he conceived to&#10;be the nature of his malady. It was, he said, a constitutional and&#10;a family evil, and one for which he despaired to find a remedy&#8212;a&#10;mere nervous affection, he immediately added, which would&#10;undoubtedly soon pass off. It displayed itself in a host of&#10;unnatural sensations. Some of these, as he detailed them,&#10;interested and bewildered me; although, perhaps, the terms and the&#10;general manner of the narration had their weight. He suffered much&#10;from a morbid acuteness of the senses. The most insipid food was&#10;alone endurable; he could wear only garments of certain texture;&#10;the odors of all flowers were oppressive; his eyes were tortured by&#10;even a faint light; and there were but peculiar sounds, and these&#10;from stringed instruments, which did not inspire him with&#10;horror.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;To an anomalous species of terror I found him a bounden slave.&#10;&#8220;I shall perish,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I must perish in this deplorable folly.&#10;Thus, thus, and not otherwise, shall I be lost. I dread the events&#10;of the future, not in themselves, but in their results. I shudder&#10;at the thought of any, even the most trivial, incident, which may&#10;operate upon this intolerable agitation of soul. I have, indeed, no&#10;abhorrence of danger, except in its absolute effect&#8212;in terror. In&#10;this unnerved&#8212;in this pitiable condition&#8212;I feel that the period&#10;will sooner or later arrive when I must abandon life and reason&#10;together, in some struggle with the grim phantasm, FEAR.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I learned, moreover, at intervals, and through broken and&#10;equivocal hints, another singular feature of his mental condition.&#10;He was enchained by certain superstitious impressions in regard to&#10;the dwelling which he tenanted, and whence, for many years, he had&#10;never ventured forth&#8212;in regard to an influence whose supposititious&#10;force was conveyed in terms too shadowy here to be restated&#8212;an&#10;influence which some peculiarities in the mere form and substance&#10;of his family mansion, had, by dint of long sufferance, he said,&#10;obtained over his spirit&#8212;an effect which the physique of the gray&#10;walls and turrets, and of the dim tarn into which they all looked&#10;down, had, at length, brought about upon the morale of his&#10;existence.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He admitted, however, although with hesitation, that much of the&#10;peculiar gloom which thus afflicted him could be traced to a more&#10;natural and far more palpable origin&#8212;to the severe and&#10;long-continued illness&#8212;indeed to the evidently approaching&#10;dissolution&#8212;of a tenderly beloved sister, his sole companion for&#10;long years, his last and only relative on earth. &#8220;Her decease,&#8221; he&#10;said, with a bitterness which I can never forget, &#8220;would leave him&#10;(him the hopeless and the frail) the last of the ancient race of&#10;the Ushers.&#8221; While he spoke, the lady Madeline (for so was she&#10;called) passed slowly through a remote portion of the apartment,&#10;and, without having noticed my presence, disappeared. I regarded&#10;her with an utter astonishment not unmingled with dread; and yet I&#10;found it impossible to account for such feelings. A sensation of&#10;stupor oppressed me, as my eyes followed her retreating steps. When&#10;a door, at length, closed upon her, my glance sought instinctively&#10;and eagerly the countenance of the brother; but he had buried his&#10;face in his hands, and I could only perceive that a far more than&#10;ordinary wanness had overspread the emaciated fingers through which&#10;trickled many passionate tears.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The disease of the lady Madeline had long baffled the skill of&#10;her physicians. A settled apathy, a gradual wasting away of the&#10;person, and frequent although transient affections of a partially&#10;cataleptical character, were the unusual diagnosis. Hitherto she&#10;had steadily borne up against the pressure of her malady, and had&#10;not betaken herself finally to bed; but on the closing in of the&#10;evening of my arrival at the house, she succumbed (as her brother&#10;told me at night with inexpressible agitation) to the prostrating&#10;power of the destroyer; and I learned that the glimpse I had&#10;obtained of her person would thus probably be the last I should&#10;obtain&#8212;that the lady, at least while living, would be seen by me no&#10;more.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For several days ensuing her name was unmentioned by either&#10;Usher or myself; and during this period I was busied in earnest&#10;endeavors to alleviate the melancholy of my friend. We painted and&#10;read together; or I listened, as if in a dream, to the wild&#10;improvisations of his speaking guitar. And thus, as a closer and&#10;still closer intimacy admitted me more unreservedly into the&#10;recesses of his spirit, the more bitterly did I perceive the&#10;futility of all attempt at cheering a mind from which darkness, as&#10;if an inherent positive quality, poured forth upon all objects of&#10;the moral and physical universe, in one unceasing radiation of&#10;gloom.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I shall ever bear about me a memory of the many solemn hours I&#10;thus spent alone with the master of the House of Usher. Yet I&#10;should fail in any attempt to convey an idea of the exact character&#10;of the studies, or of the occupations in which he involved me, or&#10;led me the way. An excited and highly distempered ideality threw a&#10;sulphurous luster over all. His long, improvised dirges will ring&#10;forever in my ears. Among other things, I hold painfully in mind a&#10;certain singular perversion and amplification of the wild air of&#10;the last waltz of Von Weber. From the paintings over which his&#10;elaborate fancy brooded, and which grew, touch by touch, into&#10;vaguenesses at which I shuddered the more thrillingly because I&#10;shuddered knowing not why,&#8212;from these paintings (vivid as their&#10;images now are before me) I would in vain endeavor to deduce more&#10;than a small portion which should lie within the compass of merely&#10;written words. By the utter simplicity, by the nakedness of his&#10;designs, he arrested and overawed attention. If ever mortal painted&#10;an idea, that mortal was Roderick Usher. For me, at least, in the&#10;circumstances then surrounding me, there arose out of the pure&#10;abstractions which the hypochondriac contrived to throw upon his&#10;canvas, an intensity of intolerable awe, no shadow of which felt I&#10;ever yet in the contemplation of the certainly glowing yet too&#10;concrete reveries of Fuseli.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;One of the phantasmagoric conceptions of my friend, partaking&#10;not so rigidly of the spirit of abstraction, may be shadowed forth,&#10;although feebly, in words. A small picture presented the interior&#10;of an immensely long and rectangular vault or tunnel, with low&#10;walls, smooth, white, and without interruption or device. Certain&#10;accessory points of the design served well to convey the idea that&#10;this excavation lay at an exceeding depth below the surface of the&#10;earth. No outlet was observed in any portion of its vast extent,&#10;and no torch or other artificial source of light was discernible;&#10;yet a flood of intense rays rolled throughout, and bathed the whole&#10;in a ghastly and inappropriate splendor.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I have just spoken of that morbid condition of the auditory&#10;nerve which rendered all music intolerable to the sufferer, with&#10;the exception of certain effects of stringed instruments. It was,&#10;perhaps, the narrow limits to which he thus confined himself upon&#10;the guitar, which gave birth, in great measure, to the fantastic&#10;character of his performances. But the fervid facility of his&#10;impromptus could not be so accounted for. They must have been, and&#10;were, in the notes, as well as in the words of his wild fantasias&#10;(for he not unfrequently accompanied himself with rimed verbal&#10;improvisations), the result of that intense mental collectedness&#10;and concentration to which I have previously alluded as observable&#10;only in particular moments of the highest artificial excitement.&#10;The words of one of these rhapsodies I have easily remembered. I&#10;was, perhaps, the more forcibly impressed with it, as he gave it,&#10;because, in the under or mystic current of its meaning, I fancied&#10;that I perceived, and for the first time, a full consciousness on&#10;the part of Usher, of the tottering of his lofty reason upon her&#10;throne. The verses, which were entitled &#8220;The Haunted Palace,&#8221; ran&#10;very nearly, if not accurately, thus:&#8212;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;IIn the greenest of our valleys,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;By good angels tenanted,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Once a fair and stately palace&#8212;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Radiant palace&#8212;reared its head.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In the monarch Thought&#8217;s dominion&#8212;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It stood there!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Never seraph spread a pinion&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Over fabric half so fair.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;II&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Banners yellow, glorious, golden,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;On its roof did float and flow;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;(This&#8212;all this&#8212;was in the olden&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Time long ago)&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And every gentle air that dallied,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In that sweet day,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Along the ramparts plumed and pallid,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A wing&#232;d odor went away.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;III&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Wanderers in that happy valley&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Through two luminous windows saw&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Spirits moving musically&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;To a lute&#8217;s well-tun&#232;d law,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Round about a throne, where sitting&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;(Porphyrogene!)&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In state his glory well befitting,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The ruler of the realm was seen.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;IV&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And all with pearl and ruby glowing&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Was the fair palace door,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Through which came flowing, flowing, flowing&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And sparkling evermore,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A troop of Echoes whose sweet duty&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Was but to sing,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In voices of surpassing beauty,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The wit and wisdom of their king.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;VBut evil things, in robes of sorrow,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Assailed the monarch&#8217;s high estate&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;(Ah, let us mourn, for never morrow&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Shall dawn upon him, desolate!);&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And, round about his home, the glory&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;That blushed and bloomed&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Is but a dim-remembered story&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Of the old time entombed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;VI&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And travelers now within that valley,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Through the red-litten windows, see&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Vast forms that move fantastically&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;To a discordant melody;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;While, like a rapid ghastly river,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Through the pale door,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A hideous throng rush out forever,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And laugh&#8212;but smile no more.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I well remember that suggestions arising from this ballad led us&#10;into a train of thought wherein there became manifest an opinion of&#10;Usher&#8217;s which I mention not so much on account of its novelty (for&#10;other men too have thought thus) as on account of the pertinacity&#10;with which he maintained it. This opinion, in its general form, was&#10;that of the sentience of all vegetable things. But, in his&#10;disordered fancy, the idea had assumed a more daring character, and&#10;trespassed, under certain conditions, upon the kingdom of&#10;inorganization. I lack words to express the full extent or the&#10;earnest abandon of his persuasion. The belief, however, was&#10;connected (as I have previously hinted) with the gray stones of the&#10;home of his forefathers. The conditions of the sentience had been&#10;here, he imagined, fulfilled in the method of collocation of these&#10;stones&#8212;in the order of their arrangement, as well as in that of the&#10;many fungi which overspread them, and of the decayed trees which&#10;stood around&#8212;above all, in the long-undisturbed endurance of this&#10;arrangement, and in its reduplication in the still waters of the&#10;tarn. Its evidence&#8212;the evidence of the sentience&#8212;was to be seen, he&#10;said (and I here started as he spoke), in the gradual yet certain&#10;condensation of an atmosphere of their own about the waters and the&#10;walls. The result was discoverable, he added, in that silent, yet&#10;importunate and terrible influence which for centuries had molded&#10;the destinies of his family, and which made him what I now saw&#10;him&#8212;what he was. Such opinions need no comment, and I will make&#10;none.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Our books&#8212;the books which, for years, had formed no small&#10;portion of the mental existence of the invalid&#8212;were, as might be&#10;supposed, in strict keeping with this character of phantasm. We&#10;pored together over such works as the &#8220;Ververt et Chartreuse&#8221; of&#10;Gresset; the &#8220;Belphegor&#8221; of Machiavelli; the &#8220;Heaven and Hell&#8221; of&#10;Swedenborg; the &#8220;Subterranean Voyage of Nicholas Klimm&#8221; by Holberg;&#10;the &#8220;Chiromancy&#8221; of Robert Flud, of Jean D&#8217;Indagin&#233;, and of De la&#10;Chambre; the &#8220;Journey into the Blue Distance&#8221; of Tieck; and the&#10;&#8220;City of the Sun&#8221; of Campanella. One favorite volume was a small&#10;octavo edition of the &#8220;Directorium Inquisitorium,&#8221; by the Dominican&#10;Eymeric de Cironne; and there were passages in Pomponius Mela,&#10;about the old African Satyrs and &#198;gipans, over which Usher would&#10;sit dreaming for hours. His chief delight, however, was found in&#10;the perusal of an exceedingly rare and curious book in quarto&#10;Gothic&#8212;the manual of a forgotten church&#8212;the &#8220;Vigili&#230; Mortuorum&#10;secundum Chorum Ecclesi&#230; Maguntin&#230;.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I could not help thinking of the wild ritual of this work, and&#10;of its probable influence upon the hypochondriac, when, one&#10;evening, having informed me abruptly that the lady Madeline was no&#10;more, he stated his intention of preserving her corpse for a&#10;fortnight (previously to its final interment) in one of the&#10;numerous vaults within the main walls of the building. The worldly&#10;reason, however, assigned for this singular proceeding, was one&#10;which I did not feel at liberty to dispute. The brother had been&#10;led to his resolution, so he told me, by consideration of the&#10;unusual character of the malady of the deceased, of certain&#10;obtrusive and eager inquiries on the part of her medical men, and&#10;of the remote and exposed situation of the burial ground of the&#10;family. I will not deny that when I called to mind the sinister&#10;countenance of the person whom I met upon the staircase, on the day&#10;of my arrival at the house, I had no desire to oppose what I&#10;regarded as at best but a harmless, and by no means an unnatural&#10;precaution.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At the request of Usher, I personally aided him in the&#10;arrangements for the temporary entombment. The body having been&#10;encoffined, we two alone bore it to its rest. The vault in which we&#10;placed it (and which had been so long unopened that our torches,&#10;half smothered in its oppressive atmosphere, gave us little&#10;opportunity for investigation) was small, damp, and entirely&#10;without means of admission for light; lying, at great depth,&#10;immediately beneath that portion of the building in which was my&#10;own sleeping apartment. It had been used, apparently, in remote&#10;feudal times, for the worst purposes of a donjon-keep, and in later&#10;days, as a place of deposit for powder, or some other highly&#10;combustible substance, as a portion of its floor, and the whole&#10;interior of a long archway through which we reached it, were&#10;carefully sheathed with copper. The door, of massive iron, had been&#10;also similarly protected. Its immense weight caused an unusually&#10;sharp grating sound, as it moved upon its hinges.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Having deposited our mournful burden upon tressels within this&#10;region of horror, we partially turned aside the yet unscrewed lid&#10;of the coffin, and looked upon the face of the tenant. A striking&#10;similitude between the brother and sister now first arrested my&#10;attention; and Usher, divining, perhaps, my thoughts, murmured out&#10;some few words from which I learned that the deceased and himself&#10;had been twins, and that sympathies of a scarcely intelligible&#10;nature had always existed between them. Our glances, however,&#10;rested not long upon the dead&#8212;for we could not regard her unawed.&#10;The disease which had thus entombed the lady in the maturity of&#10;youth, had left, as usual in all maladies of a strictly&#10;cataleptical character, the mockery of a faint blush upon the bosom&#10;and the face, and that suspiciously lingering smile upon the lip&#10;which is so terrible in death. We replaced and screwed down the&#10;lid, and having secured the door of iron, made our way, with toil,&#10;into the scarcely less gloomy apartments of the upper portion of&#10;the house.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And now, some days of bitter grief having elapsed, an observable&#10;change came over the features of the mental disorder of my friend.&#10;His ordinary manner had vanished. His ordinary occupations were&#10;neglected or forgotten. He roamed from chamber to chamber with&#10;hurried, unequal, and objectless step. The pallor of his&#10;countenance had assumed, if possible, a more ghastly hue&#8212;but the&#10;luminousness of his eye had utterly gone out. The once occasional&#10;huskiness of his tone was heard no more; and a tremulous quaver, as&#10;if of extreme terror, habitually characterized his utterance. There&#10;were times, indeed, when I thought his unceasingly agitated mind&#10;was laboring with some oppressive secret, to divulge which he&#10;struggled for the necessary courage. At times, again, I was obliged&#10;to resolve all into the mere inexplicable vagaries of madness; for&#10;I beheld him gazing upon vacancy for long hours, in an attitude of&#10;the profoundest attention, as if listening to some imaginary sound.&#10;It was no wonder that his condition terrified&#8212;that it infected me.&#10;I felt creeping upon me, by slow yet certain degrees, the wild&#10;influence of his own fantastic yet impressive superstitions.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was, especially, upon retiring to bed late in the night of&#10;the seventh or eighth day after the placing of the lady Madeline&#10;within the donjon, that I experienced the full power of such&#10;feelings. Sleep came not near my couch, while the hours waned and&#10;waned away. I struggled to reason off the nervousness which had&#10;dominion over me. I endeavored to believe that much, if not all of&#10;what I felt, was due to the bewildering influence of the gloomy&#10;furniture of the room&#8212;of the dark and tattered draperies, which,&#10;tortured into motion by the breath of a rising tempest, swayed&#10;fitfully to and fro upon the walls, and rustled uneasily about the&#10;decorations of the bed. But my efforts were fruitless. An&#10;irrepressible tremor gradually pervaded my frame; and, at length,&#10;there sat upon my very heart an incubus of utterly causeless alarm.&#10;Shaking this off with a gasp and a struggle, I uplifted myself upon&#10;the pillows, and peering earnestly within the intense darkness of&#10;the chamber, hearkened&#8212;I know not why, except that an instinctive&#10;spirit prompted me&#8212;to certain low and indefinite sounds which came,&#10;through the pauses of the storm, at long intervals, I knew not&#10;whence. Overpowered by an intense sentiment of horror,&#10;unaccountable yet unendurable, I threw on my clothes with haste&#10;(for I felt that I should sleep no more during the night), and&#10;endeavored to arouse myself from the pitiable condition into which&#10;I had fallen, by pacing rapidly to and fro through the&#10;apartment.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I had taken but few turns in this manner, when a light step on&#10;an adjoining staircase arrested my attention. I presently&#10;recognized it as that of Usher. In an instant afterward he rapped,&#10;with a gentle touch, at my door, and entered, bearing a lamp. His&#10;countenance was, as usual, cadaverously wan&#8212;but, moreover, there&#10;was a species of mad hilarity in his eyes&#8212;and evidently restrained&#10;hysteria in his whole demeanor. His air appalled me&#8212;but anything&#10;was preferable to the solitude which I had so long endured, and I&#10;even welcomed his presence as a relief.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;And you have not seen it?&#8221; he said abruptly, after having&#10;stared about him for some moments in silence&#8212;&#8220;you have not then&#10;seen it?&#8212;but stay! you shall.&#8221; Thus speaking, and having carefully&#10;shaded his lamp, he hurried to one of the casements, and threw it&#10;freely open to the storm.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The impetuous fury of the entering gust nearly lifted us from&#10;our feet. It was, indeed, a tempestuous yet sternly beautiful&#10;night, and one wildly singular in its terror and its beauty. A&#10;whirlwind had apparently collected its force in our vicinity; for&#10;there were frequent and violent alterations in the direction of the&#10;wind; and the exceeding density of the clouds (which hung so low as&#10;to press upon the turrets of the house) did not prevent our&#10;perceiving the lifelike velocity with which they flew careering&#10;from all points against each other, without passing away into the&#10;distance. I say that even their exceeding density did not prevent&#10;our perceiving this&#8212;yet we had no glimpse of the moon or stars&#8212;nor&#10;was there any flashing forth of the lightning. But the under&#10;surfaces of the huge masses of agitated vapor, as well as all&#10;terrestrial objects immediately around us, were glowing in the&#10;unnatural light of a faintly luminous and distinctly visible&#10;gaseous exhalation which hung about and enshrouded the mansion.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;You must not&#8212;you shall not behold this!&#8221; said I, shudderingly,&#10;to Usher, as I led him, with a gentle violence, from the window to&#10;a seat. &#8220;These appearances, which bewilder you, are merely&#10;electrical phenomena not uncommon&#8212;or it may be that they have their&#10;ghastly origin in the rank miasma of the tarn. Let us close this&#10;casement&#8212;the air is chilling and dangerous to your frame. Here is&#10;one of your favorite romances. I will read and you shall listen;&#10;and so we will pass away this terrible night together.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The antique volume which I had taken up was the &#8220;Mad Trist&#8221; of&#10;Sir Launcelot Canning; but I had called it a favorite of Usher&#8217;s&#10;more in sad jest than in earnest; for, in truth, there is little in&#10;its uncouth and unimaginative prolixity which could have had&#10;interest for the lofty and spiritual ideality of my friend. It was,&#10;however, the only book immediately at hand; and I indulged a vague&#10;hope that the excitement which now agitated the hypochondriac,&#10;might find relief (for the history of mental disorder is full of&#10;similar anomalies) even in the extremeness of the folly which I&#10;should read. Could I have judged, indeed, by the wild, overstrained&#10;air of vivacity with which he hearkened, or apparently harkened, to&#10;the words of the tale, I might well have congratulated myself upon&#10;the success of my design.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I had arrived at that well-known portion of the story where&#10;Ethelred, the hero of the &#8220;Trist,&#8221; having sought in vain for&#10;peaceable admission into the dwelling of the hermit, proceeds to&#10;make good an entrance by force. Here, it will be remembered, the&#10;words of the narrative run thus:&#8212;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;And Ethelred, who was by nature of a doughty heart, and who was&#10;now mighty withal, on account of the powerfulness of the wine which&#10;he had drunken, waited no longer to hold parley with the hermit,&#10;who, in sooth, was of an obstinate and maliceful turn; but, feeling&#10;the rain upon his shoulders, and fearing the rising of the tempest,&#10;uplifted his mace outright, and, with blows, made quickly room in&#10;the plankings of the door for his gauntleted hand; and now pulling&#10;therewith sturdily, he so cracked, and ripped, and tore all&#10;asunder, that the noise of the dry and hollow-sounding wood&#10;alarummed and reverberated throughout the forest.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At the termination of this sentence I started, and for a moment&#10;paused; for it appeared to me (although I at once concluded that my&#10;excited fancy had deceived me)&#8212;it appeared to me that, from some&#10;very remote portion of the mansion, there came, indistinctly, to my&#10;ears what might have been, in its exact similarity of character,&#10;the echo (but a stifled and dull one certainly) of the very&#10;cracking and ripping sound which Sir Launcelot had so particularly&#10;described. It was, beyond doubt, the coincidence alone which had&#10;arrested my attention; for, amid the rattling of the sashes of the&#10;casements, and the ordinary commingled noises of the still&#10;increasing storm, the sound, in itself, had nothing, surely, which&#10;should have interested or disturbed me. I continued the story:&#8212;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;But the good champion Ethelred, now entering within the door,&#10;was soar enraged and amazed to perceive no signal of the maliceful&#10;hermit; but, in the stead thereof, a dragon of a scaly and&#10;prodigious demeanor, and of a fiery tongue, which sate in guard&#10;before a palace of gold, with a floor of silver; and upon the wall&#10;there hung a shield of shining brass with this legend&#10;enwritten:&#8212;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Who entereth herein, a conqueror hath been;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Who slayeth the dragon, the shield he shall win.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And Ethelred uplifted his mace, and struck upon the head of the&#10;dragon, which fell before him, and gave up his pesty breath, with a&#10;shriek so horrid and harsh, and withal so piercing, that Ethelred&#10;had fain to close his ears with his hands against the dreadful&#10;noise of it, the like whereof was never before heard.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Here again I paused abruptly, and now with a feeling of wild&#10;amazement&#8212;for there could be no doubt whatever that, in this&#10;instance, I did actually hear (although from what direction it&#10;proceeded I found it impossible to say) a low and apparently&#10;distant, but harsh, protracted, and most unusual screaming or&#10;grating sound&#8212;the exact counterpart of what my fancy had already&#10;conjured up for the dragon&#8217;s unnatural shriek as described by the&#10;romancer.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Oppressed, as I certainly was, upon the occurrence of this&#10;second and most extraordinary coincidence, by a thousand&#10;conflicting sensations, in which wonder and extreme terror were&#10;predominant, I still retained sufficient presence of mind to avoid&#10;exciting, by any observation, the sensitive nervousness of my&#10;companion. I was by no means certain that he had noticed the sounds&#10;in question; although, assuredly, a strange alteration had, during&#10;the last few minutes, taken place in his demeanor. From a position&#10;fronting my own, he had gradually brought round his chair, so as to&#10;sit with his face to the door of the chamber; and thus I could but&#10;partially perceive his features, although I saw that his lips&#10;trembled as if he were murmuring inaudibly. His head had dropped&#10;upon his breast&#8212;yet I knew that he was not asleep, from the wide&#10;and rigid opening of the eye as I caught a glance of it in profile.&#10;The motion of his body, too, was at variance with this idea&#8212;for he&#10;rocked from side to side with a gentle yet constant and uniform&#10;sway. Having rapidly taken notice of all this, I resumed the&#10;narrative of Sir Launcelot, which thus proceeded:&#8212;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;And now the champion, having escaped from the terrible fury of&#10;the dragon, bethinking himself of the brazen shield, and of the&#10;breaking up of the enchantment which was upon it, removed the&#10;carcass from out of the way before him, and approached valorously&#10;over the silver pavement of the castle to where the shield was upon&#10;the wall; which in sooth tarried not for his full coming, but fell&#10;down at his feet upon the silver floor, with a mighty great and&#10;terrible ringing sound.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;No sooner had these syllables passed my lips, than&#8212;as if a&#10;shield of brass had indeed, at the moment, fallen heavily upon a&#10;floor of silver&#8212;I became aware of a distinct, hollow, metallic and&#10;clangorous, yet apparently muffled reverberation. Completely&#10;unnerved, I leaped to my feet; but the measured rocking movement of&#10;Usher was undisturbed. I rushed to the chair in which he sat. His&#10;eyes were bent fixedly before him, and throughout his whole&#10;countenance there reigned a stony rigidity. But, as I placed my&#10;hand upon his shoulder, there came a strong shudder over his whole&#10;person; a sickly smile quivered about his lips; and I saw that he&#10;spoke in a low, hurried, and gibbering murmur, as if unconscious of&#10;my presence. Bending closely over him, I at length drank in the&#10;hideous import of his words.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Not hear it?&#8212;yes, I hear it, and have heard it.&#10;Long&#8212;long&#8212;long&#8212;many minutes, many hours, many days, have I heard&#10;it&#8212;yet I dared not&#8212;oh, pity me, miserable wretch that I am!&#8212;I dared&#10;not&#8212;I dared not speak! We have put her living in the tomb! Said I&#10;not that my senses were acute? I now tell you that I heard her&#10;first feeble movements in the hollow coffin. I heard them&#8212;many,&#10;many days ago&#8212;yet I dared not&#8212;I dared not speak! And&#10;now&#8212;to-night&#8212;Ethelred&#8212;ha! ha!&#8212;the breaking of the hermit&#8217;s door,&#10;and the death-cry of the dragon, and the clangor of the&#10;shield!&#8212;say, rather, the rending of her coffin, and the grating of&#10;the iron hinges of her prison, and her struggles within the&#10;coppered archway of the vault! Oh, whither shall I fly? Will she&#10;not be here anon? Is she not hurrying to upbraid me for my haste?&#10;Have I not heard her footstep on the stair? Do I not distinguish&#10;that heavy and horrible beating of her heart? Madman!&#8221;&#8212;here he&#10;sprang furiously to his feet, and shrieked out his syllables, as if&#10;in the effort he were giving up his soul&#8212;&#8220;Madman! I tell you that&#10;she now stands without the door!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As if in the superhuman energy of his utterance there had been&#10;found the potency of a spell&#8212;the huge antique panels to which the&#10;speaker pointed threw slowly back, upon the instant, their&#10;ponderous and ebony jaws. It was the work of the rushing gust&#8212;but&#10;then without those doors there did stand the lofty and enshrouded&#10;figure of the lady Madeline of Usher. There was blood upon her&#10;white robes, and the evidence of some bitter struggle upon every&#10;portion of her emaciated frame. For a moment she remained trembling&#10;and reeling to and fro upon the threshold&#8212;then, with a low, moaning&#10;cry, fell heavily inward upon the person of her brother, and in her&#10;violent and now final death-agonies, bore him to the floor a&#10;corpse, and a victim to the terrors he had anticipated.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;From that chamber, and from that mansion, I fled aghast. The&#10;storm was still abroad in all its wrath as I found myself crossing&#10;the old causeway. Suddenly there shot along the path a wild light,&#10;and I turned to see whence a gleam so unusual could have issued;&#10;for the vast house and its shadows were alone behind me. The&#10;radiance was that of the full, setting, and blood-red moon, which&#10;now shone vividly through that once barely discernible fissure, of&#10;which I have before spoken as extending from the roof of the&#10;building, in a zigzag direction, to the base. While I gazed, this&#10;fissure rapidly widened&#8212;there came a fierce breath of the&#10;whirlwind&#8212;the entire orb of the satellite burst at once upon my&#10;sight&#8212;my brain reeled as I saw the mighty walls rushing&#10;asunder&#8212;there was a long tumultuous shouting sound like the voice&#10;of a thousand waters&#8212;and the deep and dank tarn at my feet closed&#10;sullenly and silently over the fragments of the &#8220;House of&#10;Usher.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 1, :source => 'feedbooks')

Who was it died of &#34;The Andromache&#34;?&#10;Ignoble souls!&#8212;De L&#39;Omelette perished of an ortolan. L&#39;histoire en&#10;est breve. Assist me, Spirit of Apicius!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A golden cage bore the little winged wanderer, enamored,&#10;melting, indolent, to the Chaussee D&#39;Antin, from its home in far&#10;Peru. From its queenly possessor La Bellissima, to the Duc De&#10;L&#39;Omelette, six peers of the empire conveyed the happy bird.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;That night the Duc was to sup alone. In the privacy of his&#10;bureau he reclined languidly on that ottoman for which he&#10;sacrificed his loyalty in outbidding his king&#8212;the notorious ottoman&#10;of Cadet.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He buries his face in the pillow. The clock strikes! Unable to&#10;restrain his feelings, his Grace swallows an olive. At this moment&#10;the door gently opens to the sound of soft music, and lo! the most&#10;delicate of birds is before the most enamored of men! But what&#10;inexpressible dismay now overshadows the countenance of the&#10;Duc?&#8212;&#34;Horreur!&#8212;chien!&#8212;Baptiste!&#8212;l&#39;oiseau! ah, bon Dieu! cet oiseau&#10;modeste que tu as deshabille de ses plumes, et que tu as servi sans&#10;papier!&#34; It is superfluous to say more:&#8212;the Duc expired in a&#10;paroxysm of disgust.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ha! ha! ha!&#34; said his Grace on the third day after his&#10;decease.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;He! he! he!&#34; replied the Devil faintly, drawing himself up with&#10;an air of hauteur.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why, surely you are not serious,&#34; retorted De L&#39;Omelette. &#34;I&#10;have sinned&#8212;c&#39;est vrai&#8212;but, my good sir, consider!&#8212;you have no&#10;actual intention of putting such&#8212;such barbarous threats into&#10;execution.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No what?&#34; said his majesty&#8212;&#34;come, sir, strip!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Strip, indeed! very pretty i&#39; faith! no, sir, I shall not&#10;strip. Who are you, pray, that I, Duc De L&#39;Omelette, Prince de&#10;Foie-Gras, just come of age, author of the &#39;Mazurkiad,&#39; and Member&#10;of the Academy, should divest myself at your bidding of the&#10;sweetest pantaloons ever made by Bourdon, the daintiest&#10;robe-de-chambre ever put together by Rombert&#8212;to say nothing of the&#10;taking my hair out of paper&#8212;not to mention the trouble I should&#10;have in drawing off my gloves?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Who am I?&#8212;ah, true! I am Baal-Zebub, Prince of the Fly. I took&#10;thee, just now, from a rose-wood coffin inlaid with ivory. Thou&#10;wast curiously scented, and labelled as per invoice. Belial sent&#10;thee,&#8212;my Inspector of Cemeteries. The pantaloons, which thou sayest&#10;were made by Bourdon, are an excellent pair of linen drawers, and&#10;thy robe-de-chambre is a shroud of no scanty dimensions.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Sir!&#34; replied the Duc, &#34;I am not to be insulted with impunity!-&#10;Sir! I shall take the earliest opportunity of avenging this&#10;insult!- Sir! you shall hear from me! in the meantime au&#10;revoir!&#34;&#8212;and the Duc was bowing himself out of the Satanic&#10;presence, when he was interrupted and brought back by a gentleman&#10;in waiting. Hereupon his Grace rubbed his eyes, yawned, shrugged&#10;his shoulders, reflected. Having become satisfied of his identity,&#10;he took a bird&#39;s eye view of his whereabouts.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The apartment was superb. Even De L&#39;Omelette pronounced it bien&#10;comme il faut. It was not its length nor its breadth,&#8212;but its&#10;height&#8212;ah, that was appalling!&#8212;There was no ceiling&#8212;certainly&#10;none&#8212;but a dense whirling mass of fiery-colored clouds. His Grace&#39;s&#10;brain reeled as he glanced upward. From above, hung a chain of an&#10;unknown blood-red metal&#8212;its upper end lost, like the city of&#10;Boston, parmi les nues. From its nether extremity swung a large&#10;cresset. The Duc knew it to be a ruby; but from it there poured a&#10;light so intense, so still, so terrible, Persia never worshipped&#10;such&#8212;Gheber never imagined such&#8212;Mussulman never dreamed of such&#10;when, drugged with opium, he has tottered to a bed of poppies, his&#10;back to the flowers, and his face to the God Apollo. The Duc&#10;muttered a slight oath, decidedly approbatory.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The corners of the room were rounded into niches. Three of these&#10;were filled with statues of gigantic proportions. Their beauty was&#10;Grecian, their deformity Egyptian, their tout ensemble French. In&#10;the fourth niche the statue was veiled; it was not colossal. But&#10;then there was a taper ankle, a sandalled foot. De L&#39;Omelette&#10;pressed his hand upon his heart, closed his eyes, raised them, and&#10;caught his Satanic Majesty&#8212;in a blush.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But the paintings!&#8212;Kupris! Astarte! Astoreth!&#8212;a thousand and the&#10;same! And Rafaelle has beheld them! Yes, Rafaelle has been here,&#10;for did he not paint the&#8212;&#8212;? and was he not consequently damned? The&#10;paintings&#8212;the paintings! O luxury! O love!&#8212;who, gazing on those&#10;forbidden beauties, shall have eyes for the dainty devices of the&#10;golden frames that besprinkled, like stars, the hyacinth and the&#10;porphyry walls?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But the Duc&#39;s heart is fainting within him. He is not, however,&#10;as you suppose, dizzy with magnificence, nor drunk with the&#10;ecstatic breath of those innumerable censers. C&#39;est vrai que de&#10;toutes ces choses il a pense beaucoup&#8212;mais! The Duc De L&#39;Omelette&#10;is terror-stricken; for, through the lurid vista which a single&#10;uncurtained window is affording, lo! gleams the most ghastly of all&#10;fires!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Le pauvre Duc! He could not help imagining that the glorious,&#10;the voluptuous, the never-dying melodies which pervaded that hall,&#10;as they passed filtered and transmuted through the alchemy of the&#10;enchanted window-panes, were the wailings and the howlings of the&#10;hopeless and the damned! And there, too!&#8212;there!&#8212;upon the&#10;ottoman!&#8212;who could he be?&#8212;he, the petitmaitre&#8212;no, the Deity&#8212;who sat&#10;as if carved in marble, et qui sourit, with his pale countenance,&#10;si amerement?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mais il faut agir&#8212;that is to say, a Frenchman never faints&#10;outright. Besides, his Grace hated a scene&#8212;De L&#39;Omelette is himself&#10;again. There were some foils upon a table&#8212;some points also. The Duc&#10;s&#39;echapper. He measures two points, and, with a grace inimitable,&#10;offers his Majesty the choice. Horreur! his Majesty does not&#10;fence!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mais il joue!&#8212;how happy a thought!&#8212;but his Grace had always an&#10;excellent memory. He had dipped in the &#34;Diable&#34; of Abbe Gualtier.&#10;Therein it is said &#34;que le Diable n&#39;ose pas refuser un jeu&#10;d&#39;ecarte.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But the chances&#8212;the chances! True&#8212;desperate: but scarcely more&#10;desperate than the Duc. Besides, was he not in the secret?&#8212;had he&#10;not skimmed over Pere Le Brun?&#8212;was he not a member of the Club&#10;Vingt-un? &#34;Si je perds,&#34; said he, &#34;je serai deux fois perdu&#8212;I shall&#10;be doubly dammed&#8212;voila tout! (Here his Grace shrugged his&#10;shoulders.) Si je gagne, je reviendrai a mes ortolans&#8212;que les&#10;cartes soient preparees!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;His Grace was all care, all attention&#8212;his Majesty all&#10;confidence. A spectator would have thought of Francis and Charles.&#10;His Grace thought of his game. His Majesty did not think; he&#10;shuffled. The Duc cut.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The cards were dealt. The trump is turned&#8212;it is&#8212;it is&#8212;the king!&#10;No&#8212;it was the queen. His Majesty cursed her masculine habiliments.&#10;De L&#39;Omelette placed his hand upon his heart.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;They play. The Duc counts. The hand is out. His Majesty counts&#10;heavily, smiles, and is taking wine. The Duc slips a card.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;C&#39;est a vous a faire,&#34; said his Majesty, cutting. His Grace&#10;bowed, dealt, and arose from the table en presentant le Roi.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;His Majesty looked chagrined.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Had Alexander not been Alexander, he would have been Diogenes;&#10;and the Duc assured his antagonist in taking leave, &#34;que s&#39;il n&#39;eut&#10;ete De L&#39;Omelette il n&#39;aurait point d&#39;objection d&#39;etre le&#10;Diable.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 1, :source => 'feedbooks')

Ill usage&#10;and length of years have driven me from the one, and estranged me&#10;from the other. Hereditary wealth afforded me an education of no&#10;common order, and a contemplative turn of mind enabled me to&#10;methodize the stores which early study very diligently garnered&#10;up.&#8212;Beyond all things, the study of the German moralists gave me&#10;great delight; not from any ill-advised admiration of their&#10;eloquent madness, but from the ease with which my habits of rigid&#10;thought enabled me to detect their falsities. I have often been&#10;reproached with the aridity of my genius; a deficiency of&#10;imagination has been imputed to me as a crime; and the Pyrrhonism&#10;of my opinions has at all times rendered me notorious. Indeed, a&#10;strong relish for physical philosophy has, I fear, tinctured my&#10;mind with a very common error of this age&#8212;I mean the habit of&#10;referring occurrences, even the least susceptible of such&#10;reference, to the principles of that science. Upon the whole, no&#10;person could be less liable than myself to be led away from the&#10;severe precincts of truth by the ignes fatui of superstition. I&#10;have thought proper to premise thus much, lest the incredible tale&#10;I have to tell should be considered rather the raving of a crude&#10;imagination, than the positive experience of a mind to which the&#10;reveries of fancy have been a dead letter and a nullity.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;After many years spent in foreign travel, I sailed in the year&#10;18&#8212;, from the port of Batavia, in the rich and populous island of&#10;Java, on a voyage to the Archipelago of the Sunda islands. I went&#10;as passenger&#8212;having no other inducement than a kind of nervous&#10;restlessness which haunted me as a fiend.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Our vessel was a beautiful ship of about four hundred tons,&#10;copper-fastened, and built at Bombay of Malabar teak. She was&#10;freighted with cotton-wool and oil, from the Lachadive islands. We&#10;had also on board coir, jaggeree, ghee, cocoa-nuts, and a few cases&#10;of opium. The stowage was clumsily done, and the vessel&#10;consequently crank.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;We got under way with a mere breath of wind, and for many days&#10;stood along the eastern coast of Java, without any other incident&#10;to beguile the monotony of our course than the occasional meeting&#10;with some of the small grabs of the Archipelago to which we were&#10;bound.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;One evening, leaning over the taffrail, I observed a very&#10;singular, isolated cloud, to the N.W. It was remarkable, as well&#10;for its color, as from its being the first we had seen since our&#10;departure from Batavia. I watched it attentively until sunset, when&#10;it spread all at once to the eastward and westward, girting in the&#10;horizon with a narrow strip of vapor, and looking like a long line&#10;of low beach. My notice was soon afterwards attracted by the&#10;dusky-red appearance of the moon, and the peculiar character of the&#10;sea. The latter was undergoing a rapid change, and the water seemed&#10;more than usually transparent. Although I could distinctly see the&#10;bottom, yet, heaving the lead, I found the ship in fifteen fathoms.&#10;The air now became intolerably hot, and was loaded with spiral&#10;exhalations similar to those arising from heat iron. As night came&#10;on, every breath of wind died away, an more entire calm it is&#10;impossible to conceive. The flame of a candle burned upon the poop&#10;without the least perceptible motion, and a long hair, held between&#10;the finger and thumb, hung without the possibility of detecting a&#10;vibration. However, as the captain said he could perceive no&#10;indication of danger, and as we were drifting in bodily to shore,&#10;he ordered the sails to be furled, and the anchor let go. No watch&#10;was set, and the crew, consisting principally of Malays, stretched&#10;themselves deliberately upon deck. I went below&#8212;not without a full&#10;presentiment of evil. Indeed, every appearance warranted me in&#10;apprehending a Simoom. I told the captain my fears; but he paid no&#10;attention to what I said, and left me without deigning to give a&#10;reply. My uneasiness, however, prevented me from sleeping, and&#10;about midnight I went upon deck.&#8212;As I placed my foot upon the upper&#10;step of the companion-ladder, I was startled by a loud, humming&#10;noise, like that occasioned by the rapid revolution of a&#10;mill-wheel, and before I could ascertain its meaning, I found the&#10;ship quivering to its centre. In the next instant, a wilderness of&#10;foam hurled us upon our beam-ends, and, rushing over us fore and&#10;aft, swept the entire decks from stem to stern.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The extreme fury of the blast proved, in a great measure, the&#10;salvation of the ship. Although completely water-logged, yet, as&#10;her masts had gone by the board, she rose, after a minute, heavily&#10;from the sea, and, staggering awhile beneath the immense pressure&#10;of the tempest, finally righted.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;By what miracle I escaped destruction, it is impossible to say.&#10;Stunned by the shock of the water, I found myself, upon recovery,&#10;jammed in between the stern-post and rudder. With great difficulty&#10;I gained my feet, and looking dizzily around, was, at first, struck&#10;with the idea of our being among breakers; so terrific, beyond the&#10;wildest imagination, was the whirlpool of mountainous and foaming&#10;ocean within which we were engulfed. After a while, I heard the&#10;voice of an old Swede, who had shipped with us at the moment of our&#10;leaving port. I hallooed to him with all my strength, and presently&#10;he came reeling aft. We soon discovered that we were the sole&#10;survivors of the accident. All on deck, with the exception of&#10;ourselves, had been swept overboard;&#8212;the captain and mates must&#10;have perished as they slept, for the cabins were deluged with&#10;water. Without assistance, we could expect to do little for the&#10;security of the ship, and our exertions were at first paralyzed by&#10;the momentary expectation of going down. Our cable had, of course,&#10;parted like pack-thread, at the first breath of the hurricane, or&#10;we should have been instantaneously overwhelmed. We scudded with&#10;frightful velocity before the sea, and the water made clear&#10;breaches over us. The frame-work of our stern was shattered&#10;excessively, and, in almost every respect, we had received&#10;considerable injury; but to our extreme Joy we found the pumps&#10;unchoked, and that we had made no great shifting of our ballast.&#10;The main fury of the blast had already blown over, and we&#10;apprehended little danger from the violence of the wind; but we&#10;looked forward to its total cessation with dismay; well believing,&#10;that, in our shattered condition, we should inevitably perish in&#10;the tremendous swell which would ensue. But this very just&#10;apprehension seemed by no means likely to be soon verified. For&#10;five entire days and nights&#8212;during which our only subsistence was a&#10;small quantity of jaggeree, procured with great difficulty from the&#10;forecastle&#8212;the hulk flew at a rate defying computation, before&#10;rapidly succeeding flaws of wind, which, without equalling the&#10;first violence of the Simoom, were still more terrific than any&#10;tempest I had before encountered. Our course for the first four&#10;days was, with trifling variations, S.E. and by S.; and we must&#10;have run down the coast of New Holland.&#8212;On the fifth day the cold&#10;became extreme, although the wind had hauled round a point more to&#10;the northward.&#8212;The sun arose with a sickly yellow lustre, and&#10;clambered a very few degrees above the horizon&#8212;emitting no decisive&#10;light.&#8212;There were no clouds apparent, yet the wind was upon the&#10;increase, and blew with a fitful and unsteady fury. About noon, as&#10;nearly as we could guess, our attention was again arrested by the&#10;appearance of the sun. It gave out no light, properly so called,&#10;but a dull and sullen glow without reflection, as if all its rays&#10;were polarized. Just before sinking within the turgid sea, its&#10;central fires suddenly went out, as if hurriedly extinguished by&#10;some unaccountable power. It was a dim, sliver-like rim, alone, as&#10;it rushed down the unfathomable ocean.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;We waited in vain for the arrival of the sixth day&#8212;that day to&#10;me has not arrived&#8212;to the Swede, never did arrive. Thenceforward we&#10;were enshrouded in patchy darkness, so that we could not have seen&#10;an object at twenty paces from the ship. Eternal night continued to&#10;envelop us, all unrelieved by the phosphoric sea-brilliancy to&#10;which we had been accustomed in the tropics. We observed too, that,&#10;although the tempest continued to rage with unabated violence,&#10;there was no longer to be discovered the usual appearance of surf,&#10;or foam, which had hitherto attended us. All around were horror,&#10;and thick gloom, and a black sweltering desert of&#10;ebony.&#8212;Superstitious terror crept by degrees into the spirit of the&#10;old Swede, and my own soul was wrapped up in silent wonder. We&#10;neglected all care of the ship, as worse than useless, and securing&#10;ourselves, as well as possible, to the stump of the mizen-mast,&#10;looked out bitterly into the world of ocean. We had no means of&#10;calculating time, nor could we form any guess of our situation. We&#10;were, however, well aware of having made farther to the southward&#10;than any previous navigators, and felt great amazement at not&#10;meeting with the usual impediments of ice. In the meantime every&#10;moment threatened to be our last&#8212;every mountainous billow hurried&#10;to overwhelm us. The swell surpassed anything I had imagined&#10;possible, and that we were not instantly buried is a miracle. My&#10;companion spoke of the lightness of our cargo, and reminded me of&#10;the excellent qualities of our ship; but I could not help feeling&#10;the utter hopelessness of hope itself, and prepared myself gloomily&#10;for that death which I thought nothing could defer beyond an hour,&#10;as, with every knot of way the ship made, the swelling of the black&#10;stupendous seas became more dismally appalling. At times we gasped&#10;for breath at an elevation beyond the albatross&#8212;at times became&#10;dizzy with the velocity of our descent into some watery hell, where&#10;the air grew stagnant, and no sound disturbed the slumbers of the&#10;kraken.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;We were at the bottom of one of these abysses, when a quick&#10;scream from my companion broke fearfully upon the night. &#34;See!&#10;see!&#34; cried he, shrieking in my ears, &#34;Almighty God! see! see!&#34; As&#10;he spoke, I became aware of a dull, sullen glare of red light which&#10;streamed down the sides of the vast chasm where we lay, and threw a&#10;fitful brilliancy upon our deck. Casting my eyes upwards, I beheld&#10;a spectacle which froze the current of my blood. At a terrific&#10;height directly above us, and upon the very verge of the&#10;precipitous descent, hovered a gigantic ship of, perhaps, four&#10;thousand tons. Although upreared upon the summit of a wave more&#10;than a hundred times her own altitude, her apparent size exceeded&#10;that of any ship of the line or East Indiaman in existence. Her&#10;huge hull was of a deep dingy black, unrelieved by any of the&#10;customary carvings of a ship. A single row of brass cannon&#10;protruded from her open ports, and dashed from their polished&#10;surfaces the fires of innumerable battle-lanterns, which swung to&#10;and fro about her rigging. But what mainly inspired us with horror&#10;and astonishment, was that she bore up under a press of sail in the&#10;very teeth of that supernatural sea, and of that ungovernable&#10;hurricane. When we first discovered her, her bows were alone to be&#10;seen, as she rose slowly from the dim and horrible gulf beyond her.&#10;For a moment of intense terror she paused upon the giddy pinnacle,&#10;as if in contemplation of her own sublimity, then trembled and&#10;tottered, and&#8212;came down.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At this instant, I know not what sudden self-possession came&#10;over my spirit. Staggering as far aft as I could, I awaited&#10;fearlessly the ruin that was to overwhelm. Our own vessel was at&#10;length ceasing from her struggles, and sinking with her head to the&#10;sea. The shock of the descending mass struck her, consequently, in&#10;that portion of her frame which was already under water, and the&#10;inevitable result was to hurl me, with irresistible violence, upon&#10;the rigging of the stranger.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As I fell, the ship hove in stays, and went about; and to the&#10;confusion ensuing I attributed my escape from the notice of the&#10;crew. With little difficulty I made my way unperceived to the main&#10;hatchway, which was partially open, and soon found an opportunity&#10;of secreting myself in the hold. Why I did so I can hardly tell. An&#10;indefinite sense of awe, which at first sight of the navigators of&#10;the ship had taken hold of my mind, was perhaps the principle of my&#10;concealment. I was unwilling to trust myself with a race of people&#10;who had offered, to the cursory glance I had taken, so many points&#10;of vague novelty, doubt, and apprehension. I therefore thought&#10;proper to contrive a hiding-place in the hold. This I did by&#10;removing a small portion of the shifting-boards, in such a manner&#10;as to afford me a convenient retreat between the huge timbers of&#10;the ship.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I had scarcely completed my work, when a footstep in the hold&#10;forced me to make use of it. A man passed by my place of&#10;concealment with a feeble and unsteady gait. I could not see his&#10;face, but had an opportunity of observing his general appearance.&#10;There was about it an evidence of great age and infirmity. His&#10;knees tottered beneath a load of years, and his entire frame&#10;quivered under the burthen. He muttered to himself, in a low broken&#10;tone, some words of a language which I could not understand, and&#10;groped in a corner among a pile of singular-looking instruments,&#10;and decayed charts of navigation. His manner was a wild mixture of&#10;the peevishness of second childhood, and the solemn dignity of a&#10;God. He at length went on deck, and I saw him no more.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A feeling, for which I have no name, has taken possession of my&#10;soul&#8212;a sensation which will admit of no analysis, to which the&#10;lessons of bygone times are inadequate, and for which I fear&#10;futurity itself will offer me no key. To a mind constituted like my&#10;own, the latter consideration is an evil. I shall never&#8212;I know that&#10;I shall never&#8212;be satisfied with regard to the nature of my&#10;conceptions. Yet it is not wonderful that these conceptions are&#10;indefinite, since they have their origin in sources so utterly&#10;novel. A new sense&#8212;a new entity is added to my soul.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It is long since I first trod the deck of this terrible ship,&#10;and the rays of my destiny are, I think, gathering to a focus.&#10;Incomprehensible men! Wrapped up in meditations of a kind which I&#10;cannot divine, they pass me by unnoticed. Concealment is utter&#10;folly on my part, for the people will not see. It was but just now&#10;that I passed directly before the eyes of the mate&#8212;it was no long&#10;while ago that I ventured into the captain&#39;s own private cabin, and&#10;took thence the materials with which I write, and have written. I&#10;shall from time to time continue this Journal. It is true that I&#10;may not find an opportunity of transmitting it to the world, but I&#10;will not fall to make the endeavour. At the last moment I will&#10;enclose the MS. in a bottle, and cast it within the sea.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;An incident has occurred which has given me new room for&#10;meditation. Are such things the operation of ungoverned Chance? I&#10;had ventured upon deck and thrown myself down, without attracting&#10;any notice, among a pile of ratlin-stuff and old sails in the&#10;bottom of the yawl. While musing upon the singularity of my fate, I&#10;unwittingly daubed with a tar-brush the edges of a neatly-folded&#10;studding-sail which lay near me on a barrel. The studding-sail is&#10;now bent upon the ship, and the thoughtless touches of the brush&#10;are spread out into the word DISCOVERY.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I have made many observations lately upon the structure of the&#10;vessel. Although well armed, she is not, I think, a ship of war.&#10;Her rigging, build, and general equipment, all negative a&#10;supposition of this kind. What she is not, I can easily&#10;perceive&#8212;what she is I fear it is impossible to say. I know not how&#10;it is, but in scrutinizing her strange model and singular cast of&#10;spars, her huge size and overgrown suits of canvas, her severely&#10;simple bow and antiquated stern, there will occasionally flash&#10;across my mind a sensation of familiar things, and there is always&#10;mixed up with such indistinct shadows of recollection, an&#10;unaccountable memory of old foreign chronicles and ages long ago. I&#10;have been looking at the timbers of the ship. She is built of a&#10;material to which I am a stranger. There is a peculiar character&#10;about the wood which strikes me as rendering it unfit for the&#10;purpose to which it has been applied. I mean its extreme&#10;porousness, considered independently by the worm-eaten condition&#10;which is a consequence of navigation in these seas, and apart from&#10;the rottenness attendant upon age. It will appear perhaps an&#10;observation somewhat over-curious, but this wood would have every,&#10;characteristic of Spanish oak, if Spanish oak were distended by any&#10;unnatural means.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In reading the above sentence a curious apothegm of an old&#10;weather-beaten Dutch navigator comes full upon my recollection. &#34;It&#10;is as sure,&#34; he was wont to say, when any doubt was entertained of&#10;his veracity, &#34;as sure as there is a sea where the ship itself will&#10;grow in bulk like the living body of the seaman.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;About an hour ago, I made bold to thrust myself among a group of&#10;the crew. They paid me no manner of attention, and, although I&#10;stood in the very midst of them all, seemed utterly unconscious of&#10;my presence. Like the one I had at first seen in the hold, they all&#10;bore about them the marks of a hoary old age. Their knees trembled&#10;with infirmity; their shoulders were bent double with decrepitude;&#10;their shrivelled skins rattled in the wind; their voices were low,&#10;tremulous and broken; their eyes glistened with the rheum of years;&#10;and their gray hairs streamed terribly in the tempest. Around them,&#10;on every part of the deck, lay scattered mathematical instruments&#10;of the most quaint and obsolete construction.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I mentioned some time ago the bending of a studding-sail. From&#10;that period the ship, being thrown dead off the wind, has continued&#10;her terrific course due south, with every rag of canvas packed upon&#10;her, from her trucks to her lower studding-sail booms, and rolling&#10;every moment her top-gallant yard-arms into the most appalling hell&#10;of water which it can enter into the mind of a man to imagine. I&#10;have just left the deck, where I find it impossible to maintain a&#10;footing, although the crew seem to experience little inconvenience.&#10;It appears to me a miracle of miracles that our enormous bulk is&#10;not swallowed up at once and forever. We are surely doomed to hover&#10;continually upon the brink of Eternity, without taking a final&#10;plunge into the abyss. From billows a thousand times more&#10;stupendous than any I have ever seen, we glide away with the&#10;facility of the arrowy sea-gull; and the colossal waters rear their&#10;heads above us like demons of the deep, but like demons confined to&#10;simple threats and forbidden to destroy. I am led to attribute&#10;these frequent escapes to the only natural cause which can account&#10;for such effect.&#8212;I must suppose the ship to be within the influence&#10;of some strong current, or impetuous under-tow.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I have seen the captain face to face, and in his own cabin&#8212;but,&#10;as I expected, he paid me no attention. Although in his appearance&#10;there is, to a casual observer, nothing which might bespeak him&#10;more or less than man-still a feeling of irrepressible reverence&#10;and awe mingled with the sensation of wonder with which I regarded&#10;him. In stature he is nearly my own height; that is, about five&#10;feet eight inches. He is of a well-knit and compact frame of body,&#10;neither robust nor remarkably otherwise. But it is the singularity&#10;of the expression which reigns upon the face&#8212;it is the intense, the&#10;wonderful, the thrilling evidence of old age, so utter, so extreme,&#10;which excites within my spirit a sense&#8212;a sentiment ineffable. His&#10;forehead, although little wrinkled, seems to bear upon it the stamp&#10;of a myriad of years.&#8212;His gray hairs are records of the past, and&#10;his grayer eyes are Sybils of the future. The cabin floor was&#10;thickly strewn with strange, iron-clasped folios, and mouldering&#10;instruments of science, and obsolete long-forgotten charts. His&#10;head was bowed down upon his hands, and he pored, with a fiery&#10;unquiet eye, over a paper which I took to be a commission, and&#10;which, at all events, bore the signature of a monarch. He muttered&#10;to himself, as did the first seaman whom I saw in the hold, some&#10;low peevish syllables of a foreign tongue, and although the speaker&#10;was close at my elbow, his voice seemed to reach my ears from the&#10;distance of a mile.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The ship and all in it are imbued with the spirit of Eld. The&#10;crew glide to and fro like the ghosts of buried centuries; their&#10;eyes have an eager and uneasy meaning; and when their fingers fall&#10;athwart my path in the wild glare of the battle-lanterns, I feel as&#10;I have never felt before, although I have been all my life a dealer&#10;in antiquities, and have imbibed the shadows of fallen columns at&#10;Balbec, and Tadmor, and Persepolis, until my very soul has become a&#10;ruin.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When I look around me I feel ashamed of my former apprehensions.&#10;If I trembled at the blast which has hitherto attended us, shall I&#10;not stand aghast at a warring of wind and ocean, to convey any idea&#10;of which the words tornado and simoom are trivial and ineffective?&#10;All in the immediate vicinity of the ship is the blackness of&#10;eternal night, and a chaos of foamless water; but, about a league&#10;on either side of us, may be seen, indistinctly and at intervals,&#10;stupendous ramparts of ice, towering away into the desolate sky,&#10;and looking like the walls of the universe.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As I imagined, the ship proves to be in a current; if that&#10;appellation can properly be given to a tide which, howling and&#10;shrieking by the white ice, thunders on to the southward with a&#10;velocity like the headlong dashing of a cataract.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;To conceive the horror of my sensations is, I presume, utterly&#10;impossible; yet a curiosity to penetrate the mysteries of these&#10;awful regions, predominates even over my despair, and will&#10;reconcile me to the most hideous aspect of death. It is evident&#10;that we are hurrying onwards to some exciting knowledge&#8212;some&#10;never-to-be-imparted secret, whose attainment is destruction.&#10;Perhaps this current leads us to the southern pole itself. It must&#10;be confessed that a supposition apparently so wild has every&#10;probability in its favor.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The crew pace the deck with unquiet and tremulous step; but&#10;there is upon their countenances an expression more of the&#10;eagerness of hope than of the apathy of despair.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In the meantime the wind is still in our poop, and, as we carry&#10;a crowd of canvas, the ship is at times lifted bodily from out the&#10;sea&#8212;Oh, horror upon horror! the ice opens suddenly to the right,&#10;and to the left, and we are whirling dizzily, in immense concentric&#10;circles, round and round the borders of a gigantic amphitheatre,&#10;the summit of whose walls is lost in the darkness and the distance.&#10;But little time will be left me to ponder upon my destiny&#8212;the&#10;circles rapidly grow small&#8212;we are plunging madly within the grasp&#10;of the whirlpool&#8212;and amid a roaring, and bellowing, and thundering&#10;of ocean and of tempest, the ship is quivering, oh God! and&#8212;going&#10;down.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;NOTE.&#8212;The &#34;MS. Found in a Bottle,&#34; was originally published in&#10;1831 [1833], and it was not until many years afterwards that I&#10;became acquainted with the maps of Mercator, in which the ocean is&#10;represented as rushing, by four mouths, into the (northern) Polar&#10;Gulf, to be absorbed into the bowels of the earth; the Pole itself&#10;being represented by a black rock, towering to a prodigious&#10;height.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 1, :source => 'feedbooks')

That Pierre Bon-Bon was, in an&#10;equal degree, skilled in the philosophy of that period is, I&#10;presume still more especially undeniable. His pates a la fois were&#10;beyond doubt immaculate; but what pen can do justice to his essays&#10;sur la Nature&#8212;his thoughts sur l&#39;Ame&#8212;his observations sur l&#39;Esprit?&#10;If his omelettes&#8212;if his fricandeaux were inestimable, what&#10;litterateur of that day would not have given twice as much for an&#10;&#34;Idee de Bon-Bon&#34; as for all the trash of &#34;Idees&#34; of all the rest&#10;of the savants? Bon-Bon had ransacked libraries which no other man&#10;had ransacked&#8212;had more than any other would have entertained a&#10;notion of reading&#8212;had understood more than any other would have&#10;conceived the possibility of understanding; and although, while he&#10;flourished, there were not wanting some authors at Rouen to assert&#10;&#34;that his dicta evinced neither the purity of the Academy, nor the&#10;depth of the Lyceum&#34;&#8212;although, mark me, his doctrines were by no&#10;means very generally comprehended, still it did not follow that&#10;they were difficult of comprehension. It was, I think, on account&#10;of their self-evidency that many persons were led to consider them&#10;abstruse. It is to Bon-Bon&#8212;but let this go no farther&#8212;it is to&#10;Bon-Bon that Kant himself is mainly indebted for his metaphysics.&#10;The former was indeed not a Platonist, nor strictly speaking an&#10;Aristotelian&#8212;nor did he, like the modern Leibnitz, waste those&#10;precious hours which might be employed in the invention of a&#10;fricasee or, facili gradu, the analysis of a sensation, in&#10;frivolous attempts at reconciling the obstinate oils and waters of&#10;ethical discussion. Not at all. Bon-Bon was Ionic&#8212;Bon-Bon was&#10;equally Italic. He reasoned a priori&#8212;He reasoned also a posteriori.&#10;His ideas were innate&#8212;or otherwise. He believed in George of&#10;Trebizonde&#8212;He believed in Bossarion. Bon-Bon was emphatically&#10;a&#8212;Bon-Bonist.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I have spoken of the philosopher in his capacity of&#10;restaurateur. I would not, however, have any friend of mine imagine&#10;that, in fulfilling his hereditary duties in that line, our hero&#10;wanted a proper estimation of their dignity and importance. Far&#10;from it. It was impossible to say in which branch of his profession&#10;he took the greater pride. In his opinion the powers of the&#10;intellect held intimate connection with the capabilities of the&#10;stomach. I am not sure, indeed, that he greatly disagreed with the&#10;Chinese, who held that the soul lies in the abdomen. The Greeks at&#10;all events were right, he thought, who employed the same words for&#10;the mind and the diaphragm. By this I do not mean to insinuate a&#10;charge of gluttony, or indeed any other serious charge to the&#10;prejudice of the metaphysician. If Pierre Bon-Bon had his&#10;failings&#8212;and what great man has not a thousand?&#8212;if Pierre Bon-Bon,&#10;I say, had his failings, they were failings of very little&#10;importance&#8212;faults indeed which, in other tempers, have often been&#10;looked upon rather in the light of virtues. As regards one of these&#10;foibles, I should not even have mentioned it in this history but&#10;for the remarkable prominency&#8212;the extreme alto relievo&#8212;in which it&#10;jutted out from the plane of his general disposition. He could&#10;never let slip an opportunity of making a bargain.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Not that he was avaricious&#8212;no. It was by no means necessary to&#10;the satisfaction of the philosopher, that the bargain should be to&#10;his own proper advantage. Provided a trade could be effected&#8212;a&#10;trade of any kind, upon any terms, or under any circumstances&#8212;a&#10;triumphant smile was seen for many days thereafter to enlighten his&#10;countenance, and a knowing wink of the eye to give evidence of his&#10;sagacity.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At any epoch it would not be very wonderful if a humor so&#10;peculiar as the one I have just mentioned, should elicit attention&#10;and remark. At the epoch of our narrative, had this peculiarity not&#10;attracted observation, there would have been room for wonder&#10;indeed. It was soon reported that, upon all occasions of the kind,&#10;the smile of Bon-Bon was wont to differ widely from the downright&#10;grin with which he would laugh at his own jokes, or welcome an&#10;acquaintance. Hints were thrown out of an exciting nature; stories&#10;were told of perilous bargains made in a hurry and repented of at&#10;leisure; and instances were adduced of unaccountable capacities,&#10;vague longings, and unnatural inclinations implanted by the author&#10;of all evil for wise purposes of his own.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The philosopher had other weaknesses&#8212;but they are scarcely&#10;worthy our serious examination. For example, there are few men of&#10;extraordinary profundity who are found wanting in an inclination&#10;for the bottle. Whether this inclination be an exciting cause, or&#10;rather a valid proof of such profundity, it is a nice thing to say.&#10;Bon-Bon, as far as I can learn, did not think the subject adapted&#10;to minute investigation;&#8212;nor do I. Yet in the indulgence of a&#10;propensity so truly classical, it is not to be supposed that the&#10;restaurateur would lose sight of that intuitive discrimination&#10;which was wont to characterize, at one and the same time, his&#10;essais and his omelettes. In his seclusions the Vin de Bourgogne&#10;had its allotted hour, and there were appropriate moments for the&#10;Cotes du Rhone. With him Sauterne was to Medoc what Catullus was to&#10;Homer. He would sport with a syllogism in sipping St. Peray, but&#10;unravel an argument over Clos de Vougeot, and upset a theory in a&#10;torrent of Chambertin. Well had it been if the same quick sense of&#10;propriety had attended him in the peddling propensity to which I&#10;have formerly alluded&#8212;but this was by no means the case. Indeed to&#10;say the truth, that trait of mind in the philosophic Bon-Bon did&#10;begin at length to assume a character of strange intensity and&#10;mysticism, and appeared deeply tinctured with the diablerie of his&#10;favorite German studies.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;To enter the little Cafe in the cul-de-sac Le Febvre was, at the&#10;period of our tale, to enter the sanctum of a man of genius.&#10;Bon-Bon was a man of genius. There was not a sous-cusinier in&#10;Rouen, who could not have told you that Bon-Bon was a man of&#10;genius. His very cat knew it, and forebore to whisk her tail in the&#10;presence of the man of genius. His large water-dog was acquainted&#10;with the fact, and upon the approach of his master, betrayed his&#10;sense of inferiority by a sanctity of deportment, a debasement of&#10;the ears, and a dropping of the lower jaw not altogether unworthy&#10;of a dog. It is, however, true that much of this habitual respect&#10;might have been attributed to the personal appearance of the&#10;metaphysician. A distinguished exterior will, I am constrained to&#10;say, have its way even with a beast; and I am willing to allow much&#10;in the outward man of the restaurateur calculated to impress the&#10;imagination of the quadruped. There is a peculiar majesty about the&#10;atmosphere of the little great&#8212;if I may be permitted so equivocal&#10;an expression&#8212;which mere physical bulk alone will be found at all&#10;times inefficient in creating. If, however, Bon-Bon was barely&#10;three feet in height, and if his head was diminutively small, still&#10;it was impossible to behold the rotundity of his stomach without a&#10;sense of magnificence nearly bordering upon the sublime. In its&#10;size both dogs and men must have seen a type of his acquirements&#8212;in&#10;its immensity a fitting habitation for his immortal soul.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I might here&#8212;if it so pleased me&#8212;dilate upon the matter of&#10;habiliment, and other mere circumstances of the external&#10;metaphysician. I might hint that the hair of our hero was worn&#10;short, combed smoothly over his forehead, and surmounted by a&#10;conical-shaped white flannel cap and tassels&#8212;that his pea-green&#10;jerkin was not after the fashion of those worn by the common class&#10;of restaurateurs at that day&#8212;that the sleeves were something fuller&#10;than the reigning costume permitted&#8212;that the cuffs were turned up,&#10;not as usual in that barbarous period, with cloth of the same&#10;quality and color as the garment, but faced in a more fanciful&#10;manner with the particolored velvet of Genoa&#8212;that his slippers were&#10;of a bright purple, curiously filigreed, and might have been&#10;manufactured in Japan, but for the exquisite pointing of the toes,&#10;and the brilliant tints of the binding and embroidery&#8212;that his&#10;breeches were of the yellow satin-like material called aimable&#8212;that&#10;his sky-blue cloak, resembling in form a dressing-wrapper, and&#10;richly bestudded all over with crimson devices, floated cavalierly&#10;upon his shoulders like a mist of the morning&#8212;and that his tout&#10;ensemble gave rise to the remarkable words of Benevenuta, the&#10;Improvisatrice of Florence, &#34;that it was difficult to say whether&#10;Pierre Bon-Bon was indeed a bird of Paradise, or rather a very&#10;Paradise of perfection.&#34; I might, I say, expatiate upon all these&#10;points if I pleased,&#8212;but I forbear, merely personal details may be&#10;left to historical novelists,&#8212;they are beneath the moral dignity of&#10;matter-of-fact.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I have said that &#34;to enter the Cafe in the cul-de-sac Le Febvre&#10;was to enter the sanctum of a man of genius&#34;&#8212;but then it was only&#10;the man of genius who could duly estimate the merits of the&#10;sanctum. A sign, consisting of a vast folio, swung before the&#10;entrance. On one side of the volume was painted a bottle; on the&#10;reverse a pate. On the back were visible in large letters Oeuvres&#10;de Bon-Bon. Thus was delicately shadowed forth the two-fold&#10;occupation of the proprietor.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Upon stepping over the threshold, the whole interior of the&#10;building presented itself to view. A long, low-pitched room, of&#10;antique construction, was indeed all the accommodation afforded by&#10;the Cafe. In a corner of the apartment stood the bed of the&#10;metaphysician. An army of curtains, together with a canopy a la&#10;Grecque, gave it an air at once classic and comfortable. In the&#10;corner diagonary opposite, appeared, in direct family communion,&#10;the properties of the kitchen and the bibliotheque. A dish of&#10;polemics stood peacefully upon the dresser. Here lay an ovenful of&#10;the latest ethics&#8212;there a kettle of dudecimo melanges. Volumes of&#10;German morality were hand and glove with the gridiron&#8212;a&#10;toasting-fork might be discovered by the side of Eusebius&#8212;Plato&#10;reclined at his ease in the frying-pan&#8212;and contemporary manuscripts&#10;were filed away upon the spit.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In other respects the Cafe de Bon-Bon might be said to differ&#10;little from the usual restaurants of the period. A fireplace yawned&#10;opposite the door. On the right of the fireplace an open cupboard&#10;displayed a formidable array of labelled bottles.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was here, about twelve o&#39;clock one night during the severe&#10;winter the comments of his neighbours upon his singular&#10;propensity&#8212;that Pierre Bon-Bon, I say, having turned them all out&#10;of his house, locked the door upon them with an oath, and betook&#10;himself in no very pacific mood to the comforts of a&#10;leather-bottomed arm-chair, and a fire of blazing fagots.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was one of those terrific nights which are only met with once&#10;or twice during a century. It snowed fiercely, and the house&#10;tottered to its centre with the floods of wind that, rushing&#10;through the crannies in the wall, and pouring impetuously down the&#10;chimney, shook awfully the curtains of the philosopher&#39;s bed, and&#10;disorganized the economy of his pate-pans and papers. The huge&#10;folio sign that swung without, exposed to the fury of the tempest,&#10;creaked ominously, and gave out a moaning sound from its stanchions&#10;of solid oak.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was in no placid temper, I say, that the metaphysician drew&#10;up his chair to its customary station by the hearth. Many&#10;circumstances of a perplexing nature had occurred during the day,&#10;to disturb the serenity of his meditations. In attempting des oeufs&#10;a la Princesse, he had unfortunately perpetrated an omelette a la&#10;Reine; the discovery of a principle in ethics had been frustrated&#10;by the overturning of a stew; and last, not least, he had been&#10;thwarted in one of those admirable bargains which he at all times&#10;took such especial delight in bringing to a successful termination.&#10;But in the chafing of his mind at these unaccountable vicissitudes,&#10;there did not fail to be mingled some degree of that nervous&#10;anxiety which the fury of a boisterous night is so well calculated&#10;to produce. Whistling to his more immediate vicinity the large&#10;black water-dog we have spoken of before, and settling himself&#10;uneasily in his chair, he could not help casting a wary and unquiet&#10;eye toward those distant recesses of the apartment whose inexorable&#10;shadows not even the red firelight itself could more than partially&#10;succeed in overcoming. Having completed a scrutiny whose exact&#10;purpose was perhaps unintelligible to himself, he drew close to his&#10;seat a small table covered with books and papers, and soon became&#10;absorbed in the task of retouching a voluminous manuscript,&#10;intended for publication on the morrow.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He had been thus occupied for some minutes when &#34;I am in no&#10;hurry, Monsieur Bon-Bon,&#34; suddenly whispered a whining voice in the&#10;apartment.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The devil!&#34; ejaculated our hero, starting to his feet,&#10;overturning the table at his side, and staring around him in&#10;astonishment.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Very true,&#34; calmly replied the voice.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Very true!&#8212;what is very true?&#8212;how came you here?&#34; vociferated&#10;the metaphysician, as his eye fell upon something which lay&#10;stretched at full length upon the bed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I was saying,&#34; said the intruder, without attending to the&#10;interrogatives,&#8212;&#34;I was saying that I am not at all pushed for time-&#10;that the business upon which I took the liberty of calling, is of&#10;no pressing importance&#8212;in short, that I can very well wait until&#10;you have finished your Exposition.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My Exposition!&#8212;there now!&#8212;how do you know?&#8212;how came you to&#10;understand that I was writing an Exposition?&#8212;good God!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Hush!&#34; replied the figure, in a shrill undertone; and, arising&#10;quickly from the bed, he made a single step toward our hero, while&#10;an iron lamp that depended over-head swung convulsively back from&#10;his approach.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The philosopher&#39;s amazement did not prevent a narrow scrutiny of&#10;the stranger&#39;s dress and appearance. The outlines of his figure,&#10;exceedingly lean, but much above the common height, were rendered&#10;minutely distinct, by means of a faded suit of black cloth which&#10;fitted tight to the skin, but was otherwise cut very much in the&#10;style of a century ago. These garments had evidently been intended&#10;for a much shorter person than their present owner. His ankles and&#10;wrists were left naked for several inches. In his shoes, however, a&#10;pair of very brilliant buckles gave the lie to the extreme poverty&#10;implied by the other portions of his dress. His head was bare, and&#10;entirely bald, with the exception of a hinder part, from which&#10;depended a queue of considerable length. A pair of green&#10;spectacles, with side glasses, protected his eyes from the&#10;influence of the light, and at the same time prevented our hero&#10;from ascertaining either their color or their conformation. About&#10;the entire person there was no evidence of a shirt, but a white&#10;cravat, of filthy appearance, was tied with extreme precision&#10;around the throat and the ends hanging down formally side by side&#10;gave (although I dare say unintentionally) the idea of an&#10;ecclesiastic. Indeed, many other points both in his appearance and&#10;demeanor might have very well sustained a conception of that&#10;nature. Over his left ear, he carried, after the fashion of a&#10;modern clerk, an instrument resembling the stylus of the ancients.&#10;In a breast-pocket of his coat appeared conspicuously a small black&#10;volume fastened with clasps of steel. This book, whether&#10;accidentally or not, was so turned outwardly from the person as to&#10;discover the words &#34;Rituel Catholique&#34; in white letters upon the&#10;back. His entire physiognomy was interestingly saturnine&#8212;even&#10;cadaverously pale. The forehead was lofty, and deeply furrowed with&#10;the ridges of contemplation. The corners of the mouth were drawn&#10;down into an expression of the most submissive humility. There was&#10;also a clasping of the hands, as he stepped toward our hero&#8212;a deep&#10;sigh&#8212;and altogether a look of such utter sanctity as could not have&#10;failed to be unequivocally preposessing. Every shadow of anger&#10;faded from the countenance of the metaphysician, as, having&#10;completed a satisfactory survey of his visiter&#39;s person, he shook&#10;him cordially by the hand, and conducted him to a seat.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There would however be a radical error in attributing this&#10;instantaneous transition of feeling in the philosopher, to any one&#10;of those causes which might naturally be supposed to have had an&#10;influence. Indeed, Pierre Bon-Bon, from what I have been able to&#10;understand of his disposition, was of all men the least likely to&#10;be imposed upon by any speciousness of exterior deportment. It was&#10;impossible that so accurate an observer of men and things should&#10;have failed to discover, upon the moment, the real character of the&#10;personage who had thus intruded upon his hospitality. To say no&#10;more, the conformation of his visiter&#39;s feet was sufficiently&#10;remarkable&#8212;he maintained lightly upon his head an inordinately tall&#10;hat&#8212;there was a tremulous swelling about the hinder part of his&#10;breeches&#8212;and the vibration of his coat tail was a palpable fact.&#10;Judge, then, with what feelings of satisfaction our hero found&#10;himself thrown thus at once into the society of a person for whom&#10;he had at all times entertained the most unqualified respect. He&#10;was, however, too much of the diplomatist to let escape him any&#10;intimation of his suspicions in regard to the true state of&#10;affairs. It was not his cue to appear at all conscious of the high&#10;honor he thus unexpectedly enjoyed; but, by leading his guest into&#10;the conversation, to elicit some important ethical ideas, which&#10;might, in obtaining a place in his contemplated publication,&#10;enlighten the human race, and at the same time immortalize&#10;himself&#8212;ideas which, I should have added, his visitor&#39;s great age,&#10;and well-known proficiency in the science of morals, might very&#10;well have enabled him to afford.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Actuated by these enlightened views, our hero bade the gentleman&#10;sit down, while he himself took occasion to throw some fagots upon&#10;the fire, and place upon the now re-established table some bottles&#10;of Mousseux. Having quickly completed these operations, he drew his&#10;chair vis-a-vis to his companion&#39;s, and waited until the latter&#10;should open the conversation. But plans even the most skilfully&#10;matured are often thwarted in the outset of their application&#8212;and&#10;the restaurateur found himself nonplussed by the very first words&#10;of his visiter&#39;s speech.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I see you know me, Bon-Bon,&#34; said he; &#34;ha! ha! ha!&#8212;he! he!&#10;he!&#8212;hi! hi! hi!&#8212;ho! ho! ho!&#8212;hu! hu! hu!&#34;&#8212;and the devil, dropping at&#10;once the sanctity of his demeanor, opened to its fullest extent a&#10;mouth from ear to ear, so as to display a set of jagged and&#10;fang-like teeth, and, throwing back his head, laughed long, loudly,&#10;wickedly, and uproariously, while the black dog, crouching down&#10;upon his haunches, joined lustily in the chorus, and the tabby cat,&#10;flying off at a tangent, stood up on end, and shrieked in the&#10;farthest corner of the apartment.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Not so the philosopher; he was too much a man of the world&#10;either to laugh like the dog, or by shrieks to betray the&#10;indecorous trepidation of the cat. It must be confessed, he felt a&#10;little astonishment to see the white letters which formed the words&#10;&#34;Rituel Catholique&#34; on the book in his guest&#39;s pocket, momently&#10;changing both their color and their import, and in a few seconds,&#10;in place of the original title the words Regitre des Condamnes&#10;blazed forth in characters of red. This startling circumstance,&#10;when Bon-Bon replied to his visiter&#39;s remark, imparted to his&#10;manner an air of embarrassment which probably might, not otherwise&#10;have been observed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why sir,&#34; said the philosopher, &#34;why sir, to speak sincerely&#8212;I&#10;I imagine&#8212;I have some faint&#8212;some very faint idea&#8212;of the remarkable&#10;honor&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh!&#8212;ah!&#8212;yes!&#8212;very well!&#34; interrupted his Majesty; &#34;say no&#10;more&#8212;I see how it is.&#34; And hereupon, taking off his green&#10;spectacles, he wiped the glasses carefully with the sleeve of his&#10;coat, and deposited them in his pocket.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;If Bon-Bon had been astonished at the incident of the book, his&#10;amazement was now much increased by the spectacle which here&#10;presented itself to view. In raising his eyes, with a strong&#10;feeling of curiosity to ascertain the color of his guest&#39;s, he&#10;found them by no means black, as he had anticipated&#8212;nor gray, as&#10;might have been imagined&#8212;nor yet hazel nor blue&#8212;nor indeed yellow&#10;nor red&#8212;nor purple&#8212;nor white&#8212;nor green&#8212;nor any other color in the&#10;heavens above, or in the earth beneath, or in the waters under the&#10;earth. In short, Pierre Bon-Bon not only saw plainly that his&#10;Majesty had no eyes whatsoever, but could discover no indications&#10;of their having existed at any previous period&#8212;for the space where&#10;eyes should naturally have been was, I am constrained to say,&#10;simply a dead level of flesh.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was not in the nature of the metaphysician to forbear making&#10;some inquiry into the sources of so strange a phenomenon, and the&#10;reply of his Majesty was at once prompt, dignified, and&#10;satisfactory.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Eyes! my dear Bon-Bon&#8212;eyes! did you say?&#8212;oh!&#8212;ah!&#8212;I perceive!&#10;The ridiculous prints, eh, which are in, circulation, have given&#10;you a false idea of my personal appearance? Eyes!&#8212;true. Eyes,&#10;Pierre Bon-Bon, are very well in their proper place&#8212;that, you would&#10;say, is the head?&#8212;right&#8212;the head of a worm. To you, likewise, these&#10;optics are indispensable&#8212;yet I will convince you that my vision is&#10;more penetrating than your own. There is a cat I see in the&#10;corner&#8212;a pretty cat&#8212;look at her&#8212;observe her well. Now, Bon-Bon, do&#10;you behold the thoughts&#8212;the thoughts, I say,&#8212;the ideas&#8212;the&#10;reflections&#8212;which are being engendered in her pericranium? There it&#10;is, now&#8212;you do not! She is thinking we admire the length of her&#10;tail and the profundity of her mind. She has just concluded that I&#10;am the most distinguished of ecclesiastics, and that you are the&#10;most superficial of metaphysicians. Thus you see I am not&#10;altogether blind; but to one of my profession, the eyes you speak&#10;of would be merely an incumbrance, liable at any time to be put out&#10;by a toasting-iron, or a pitchfork. To you, I allow, these optical&#10;affairs are indispensable. Endeavor, Bon-Bon, to use them well;&#8212;my&#10;vision is the soul.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Hereupon the guest helped himself to the wine upon the table,&#10;and pouring out a bumper for Bon-Bon, requested him to drink it&#10;without scruple, and make himself perfectly at home.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;A clever book that of yours, Pierre,&#34; resumed his Majesty,&#10;tapping our friend knowingly upon the shoulder, as the latter put&#10;down his glass after a thorough compliance with his visiter&#39;s&#10;injunction. &#34;A clever book that of yours, upon my honor. It&#39;s a&#10;work after my own heart. Your arrangement of the matter, I think,&#10;however, might be improved, and many of your notions remind me of&#10;Aristotle. That philosopher was one of my most intimate&#10;acquaintances. I liked him as much for his terrible ill temper, as&#10;for his happy knack at making a blunder. There is only one solid&#10;truth in all that he has written, and for that I gave him the hint&#10;out of pure compassion for his absurdity. I suppose, Pierre&#10;Bon-Bon, you very well know to what divine moral truth I am&#10;alluding?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Cannot say that I&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Indeed!&#8212;why it was I who told Aristotle that by sneezing, men&#10;expelled superfluous ideas through the proboscis.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Which is&#8212;hiccup!&#8212;undoubtedly the case,&#34; said the metaphysician,&#10;while he poured out for himself another bumper of Mousseux, and&#10;offered his snuff-box to the fingers of his visiter.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;There was Plato, too,&#34; continued his Majesty, modestly&#10;declining the snuff-box and the compliment it implied&#8212;&#34;there was&#10;Plato, too, for whom I, at one time, felt all the affection of a&#10;friend. You knew Plato, Bon-Bon?&#8212;ah, no, I beg a thousand pardons.&#10;He met me at Athens, one day, in the Parthenon, and told me he was&#10;distressed for an idea. I bade him write, down that o nous estin&#10;aulos. He said that he would do so, and went home, while I stepped&#10;over to the pyramids. But my conscience smote me for having uttered&#10;a truth, even to aid a friend, and hastening back to Athens, I&#10;arrived behind the philosopher&#39;s chair as he was inditing the&#10;&#39;aulos.&#39;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Giving the lambda a fillip with my finger, I turned it upside&#10;down. So the sentence now read &#39;o nous estin augos&#39;, and is, you&#10;perceive, the fundamental doctrines in his metaphysics.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Were you ever at Rome?&#34; asked the restaurateur, as he finished&#10;his second bottle of Mousseux, and drew from the closet a larger&#10;supply of Chambertin.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But once, Monsieur Bon-Bon, but once. There was a time,&#34; said&#10;the devil, as if reciting some passage from a book&#8212;&#34;there was a&#10;time when occurred an anarchy of five years, during which the&#10;republic, bereft of all its officers, had no magistracy besides the&#10;tribunes of the people, and these were not legally vested with any&#10;degree of executive power&#8212;at that time, Monsieur Bon-Bon&#8212;at that&#10;time only I was in Rome, and I have no earthly acquaintance,&#10;consequently, with any of its philosophy.&#34;*&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;*Ils ecrivaient sur la Philosophie (Cicero, Lucretius, Seneca)&#10;mais c&#39;etait la Philosophie Grecque.&#8212;Condorcet.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What do you think of&#8212;what do you think&#10;of&#8212;hiccup!&#8212;Epicurus?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What do I think of whom?&#34; said the devil, in astonishment, &#34;you&#10;cannot surely mean to find any fault with Epicurus! What do I think&#10;of Epicurus! Do you mean me, sir?&#8212;I am Epicurus! I am the same&#10;philosopher who wrote each of the three hundred treatises&#10;commemorated by Diogenes Laertes.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That&#39;s a lie!&#34; said the metaphysician, for the wine had gotten&#10;a little into his head.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Very well!&#8212;very well, sir!&#8212;very well, indeed, sir!&#34; said his&#10;Majesty, apparently much flattered.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That&#39;s a lie!&#34; repeated the restaurateur, dogmatically; &#34;that&#39;s&#10;a&#8212;hiccup!&#8212;a lie!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well, well, have it your own way!&#34; said the devil, pacifically,&#10;and Bon-Bon, having beaten his Majesty at argument, thought it his&#10;duty to conclude a second bottle of Chambertin.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;As I was saying,&#34; resumed the visiter&#8212;&#34;as I was observing a&#10;little while ago, there are some very outre notions in that book of&#10;yours Monsieur Bon-Bon. What, for instance, do you mean by all that&#10;humbug about the soul? Pray, sir, what is the soul?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The&#8212;hiccup!&#8212;soul,&#34; replied the metaphysician, referring to his&#10;MS., &#34;is undoubtedly&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No, sir!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Indubitably&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No, sir!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Indisputably&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No, sir!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Evidently&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No, sir!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Incontrovertibly&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No, sir!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Hiccup!&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No, sir!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And beyond all question, a&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No sir, the soul is no such thing!&#34; (Here the philosopher,&#10;looking daggers, took occasion to make an end, upon the spot, of&#10;his third bottle of Chambertin.)&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Then&#8212;hic-cup!&#8212;pray, sir&#8212;what&#8212;what is it?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That is neither here nor there, Monsieur Bon-Bon,&#34; replied his&#10;Majesty, musingly. &#34;I have tasted&#8212;that is to say, I have known some&#10;very bad souls, and some too&#8212;pretty good ones.&#34; Here he smacked his&#10;lips, and, having unconsciously let fall his hand upon the volume&#10;in his pocket, was seized with a violent fit of sneezing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He continued.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;There was the soul of Cratinus&#8212;passable: Aristophanes&#8212;racy:&#10;Plato&#8212;exquisite&#8212;not your Plato, but Plato the comic poet; your&#10;Plato would have turned the stomach of Cerberus&#8212;faugh! Then let me&#10;see! there were Naevius, and Andronicus, and Plautus, and&#10;Terentius. Then there were Lucilius, and Catullus, and Naso, and&#10;Quintus Flaccus,- dear Quinty! as I called him when he sung a&#10;seculare for my amusement, while I toasted him, in pure good humor,&#10;on a fork. But they want flavor, these Romans. One fat Greek is&#10;worth a dozen of them, and besides will keep, which cannot be said&#10;of a Quirite.&#8212;Let us taste your Sauterne.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Bon-Bon had by this time made up his mind to nil admirari and&#10;endeavored to hand down the bottles in question. He was, however,&#10;conscious of a strange sound in the room like the wagging of a&#10;tail. Of this, although extremely indecent in his Majesty, the&#10;philosopher took no notice:&#8212;simply kicking the dog, and requesting&#10;him to be quiet. The visiter continued:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I found that Horace tasted very much like Aristotle;&#8212;you know I&#10;am fond of variety. Terentius I could not have told from Menander.&#10;Naso, to my astonishment, was Nicander in disguise. Virgilius had a&#10;strong twang of Theocritus. Martial put me much in mind of&#10;Archilochus&#8212;and Titus Livius was positively Polybius and none&#10;other.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Hic-cup!&#34; here replied Bon-Bon, and his majesty proceeded:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But if I have a penchant, Monsieur Bon-Bon&#8212;if I have a&#10;penchant, it is for a philosopher. Yet, let me tell you, sir, it is&#10;not every dev&#8212;I mean it is not every gentleman who knows how to&#10;choose a philosopher. Long ones are not good; and the best, if not&#10;carefully shelled, are apt to be a little rancid on account of the&#10;gall!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Shelled!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I mean taken out of the carcass.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What do you think of a&#8212;hic-cup!&#8212;physician?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Don&#39;t mention them!&#8212;ugh! ugh! ugh!&#34; (Here his Majesty retched&#10;violently.) &#34;I never tasted but one&#8212;that rascal Hippocrates!&#8212;smelt&#10;of asafoetida&#8212;ugh! ugh! ugh!&#8212;caught a wretched cold washing him in&#10;the Styx&#8212;and after all he gave me the cholera morbus.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The&#8212;hiccup&#8212;wretch!&#34; ejaculated Bon-Bon,&#10;&#34;the&#8212;hic-cup!&#8212;absorption of a pill-box!&#34;&#8212;and the philosopher&#10;dropped a tear.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;After all,&#34; continued the visiter, &#34;after all, if a dev&#8212;if a&#10;gentleman wishes to live, he must have more talents than one or&#10;two; and with us a fat face is an evidence of diplomacy.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;How so?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why, we are sometimes exceedingly pushed for provisions. You&#10;must know that, in a climate so sultry as mine, it is frequently&#10;impossible to keep a spirit alive for more than two or three hours;&#10;and after death, unless pickled immediately (and a pickled spirit&#10;is not good), they will&#8212;smell&#8212;you understand, eh? Putrefaction is&#10;always to be apprehended when the souls are consigned to us in the&#10;usual way.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Hiccup!&#8212;hiccup!&#8212;good God! how do you manage?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Here the iron lamp commenced swinging with redoubled violence,&#10;and the devil half started from his seat;&#8212;however, with a slight&#10;sigh, he recovered his composure, merely saying to our hero in a&#10;low tone: &#34;I tell you what, Pierre Bon-Bon, we must have no more&#10;swearing.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The host swallowed another bumper, by way of denoting thorough&#10;comprehension and acquiescence, and the visiter continued.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why, there are several ways of managing. The most of us starve:&#10;some put up with the pickle: for my part I purchase my spirits&#10;vivente corpore, in which case I find they keep very well.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But the body!&#8212;hiccup!&#8212;the body!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The body, the body&#8212;well, what of the body?&#8212;oh! ah! I perceive.&#10;Why, sir, the body is not at all affected by the transaction. I&#10;have made innumerable purchases of the kind in my day, and the&#10;parties never experienced any inconvenience. There were Cain and&#10;Nimrod, and Nero, and Caligula, and Dionysius, and Pisistratus,&#10;and&#8212;and a thousand others, who never knew what it was to have a&#10;soul during the latter part of their lives; yet, sir, these men&#10;adorned society. Why possession of his faculties, mental and&#10;corporeal? Who writes a keener epigram? Who reasons more wittily?&#10;Who&#8212;but stay! I have his agreement in my pocket-book.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Thus saying, he produced a red leather wallet, and took from it&#10;a number of papers. Upon some of these Bon-Bon caught a glimpse of&#10;the letters Machi&#8212;Maza&#8212;Robesp&#8212;with the words Caligula, George,&#10;Elizabeth. His Majesty selected a narrow slip of parchment, and&#10;from it read aloud the following words:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;In consideration of certain mental endowments which it is&#10;unnecessary to specify, and in further consideration of one&#10;thousand louis d&#39;or, I being aged one year and one month, do hereby&#10;make over to the bearer of this agreement all my right, title, and&#10;appurtenance in the shadow called my soul. (Signed) A&#8230; .&#34;* (Here&#10;His Majesty repeated a name which I did not feel justified in&#10;indicating more unequivocally.)&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;* Quere-Arouet?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;A clever fellow that,&#34; resumed he; &#34;but like you, Monsieur&#10;Bon-Bon, he was mistaken about the soul. The soul a shadow, truly!&#10;The soul a shadow; Ha! ha! ha!&#8212;he! he! he!&#8212;hu! hu! hu! Only think&#10;of a fricasseed shadow!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Only think&#8212;hiccup!&#8212;of a fricasseed shadow!&#34; exclaimed our hero,&#10;whose faculties were becoming much illuminated by the profundity of&#10;his Majesty&#39;s discourse.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Only think of a hiccup!&#8212;fricasseed shadow!! Now,&#10;damme!&#8212;hiccup!&#8212;humph! If I would have been such&#10;a&#8212;hiccup!&#8212;nincompoop! My soul, Mr.&#8212;humph!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Your soul, Monsieur Bon-Bon?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, sir&#8212;hiccup!&#8212;my soul is&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What, sir?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No shadow, damme!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Did you mean to say&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, sir, my soul is&#8212;hiccup!&#8212;humph!&#8212;yes, sir.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Did you not intend to assert&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My soul is&#8212;hiccup!&#8212;peculiarly qualified for&#8212;hiccup!&#8212;a&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What, sir?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Stew.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ha!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Soufflee.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Eh!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Fricassee.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Indeed!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ragout and fricandeau&#8212;and see here, my good fellow! I&#39;ll let&#10;you have it&#8212;hiccup!&#8212;a bargain.&#34; Here the philosopher slapped his&#10;Majesty upon the back.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Couldn&#39;t think of such a thing,&#34; said the latter calmly, at the&#10;same time rising from his seat. The metaphysician stared.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Am supplied at present,&#34; said his Majesty.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Hiccup&#8212;e-h?&#34; said the philosopher.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Have no funds on hand.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Besides, very unhandsome in me&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Sir!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;To take advantage of&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Hiccup!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Your present disgusting and ungentlemanly situation.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Here the visiter bowed and withdrew&#8212;in what manner could not&#10;precisely be ascertained&#8212;but in a well-concerted effort to&#10;discharge a bottle at &#34;the villain,&#34; the slender chain was severed&#10;that depended from the ceiling, and the metaphysician prostrated by&#10;the downfall of the lamp.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 1, :source => 'feedbooks')

For indeed&#10;strange things shall happen, and secret things be known, and many&#10;centuries shall pass away, ere these memorials be seen of men. And,&#10;when seen, there will be some to disbelieve, and some to doubt, and&#10;yet a few who will find much to ponder upon in the characters here&#10;graven with a stylus of iron.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The year had been a year of terror, and of feelings more intense&#10;than terror for which there is no name upon the earth. For many&#10;prodigies and signs had taken place, and far and wide, over sea and&#10;land, the black wings of the Pestilence were spread abroad. To&#10;those, nevertheless, cunning in the stars, it was not unknown that&#10;the heavens wore an aspect of ill; and to me, the Greek Oinos,&#10;among others, it was evident that now had arrived the alternation&#10;of that seven hundred and ninety-fourth year when, at the entrance&#10;of Aries, the planet Jupiter is conjoined with the red ring of the&#10;terrible Saturnus. The peculiar spirit of the skies, if I mistake&#10;not greatly, made itself manifest, not only in the physical orb of&#10;the earth, but in the souls, imaginations, and meditations of&#10;mankind.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Over some flasks of the red Chian wine, within the walls of a&#10;noble hall, in a dim city called Ptolemais, we sat, at night, a&#10;company of seven. And to our chamber there was no entrance save by&#10;a lofty door of brass: and the door was fashioned by the artisan&#10;Corinnos, and, being of rare workmanship, was fastened from within.&#10;Black draperies, likewise, in the gloomy room, shut out from our&#10;view the moon, the lurid stars, and the peopleless streets- but the&#10;boding and the memory of Evil they would not be so excluded. There&#10;were things around us and about of which I can render no distinct&#10;account- things material and spiritual- heaviness in the&#10;atmosphere- a sense of suffocation- anxiety- and, above all, that&#10;terrible state of existence which the nervous experience when the&#10;senses are keenly living and awake, and meanwhile the powers of&#10;thought lie dormant. A dead weight hung upon us. It hung upon our&#10;limbs- upon the household furniture- upon the goblets from which we&#10;drank; and all things were depressed, and borne down thereby- all&#10;things save only the flames of the seven lamps which illumined our&#10;revel. Uprearing themselves in tall slender lines of light, they&#10;thus remained burning all pallid and motionless; and in the mirror&#10;which their lustre formed upon the round table of ebony at which we&#10;sat, each of us there assembled beheld the pallor of his own&#10;countenance, and the unquiet glare in the downcast eyes of his&#10;companions. Yet we laughed and were merry in our proper way- which&#10;was hysterical; and sang the songs of Anacreon- which are madness;&#10;and drank deeply- although the purple wine reminded us of blood.&#10;For there was yet another tenant of our chamber in the person of&#10;young Zoilus. Dead, and at full length he lay, enshrouded; the&#10;genius and the demon of the scene. Alas! he bore no portion in our&#10;mirth, save that his countenance, distorted with the plague, and&#10;his eyes, in which Death had but half extinguished the fire of the&#10;pestilence, seemed to take such interest in our merriment as the&#10;dead may haply take in the merriment of those who are to die. But&#10;although I, Oinos, felt that the eyes of the departed were upon me,&#10;still I forced myself not to perceive the bitterness of their&#10;expression, and gazing down steadily into the depths of the ebony&#10;mirror, sang with a loud and sonorous voice the songs of the son of&#10;Teios. But gradually my songs they ceased, and their echoes,&#10;rolling afar off among the sable draperies of the chamber, became&#10;weak, and undistinguishable, and so faded away. And lo! from among&#10;those sable draperies where the sounds of the song departed, there&#10;came forth a dark and undefined shadow- a shadow such as the moon,&#10;when low in heaven, might fashion from the figure of a man: but it&#10;was the shadow neither of man nor of God, nor of any familiar&#10;thing. And quivering awhile among the draperies of the room, it at&#10;length rested in full view upon the surface of the door of brass.&#10;But the shadow was vague, and formless, and indefinite, and was the&#10;shadow neither of man nor of God- neither God of Greece, nor God of&#10;Chaldaea, nor any Egyptian God. And the shadow rested upon the&#10;brazen doorway, and under the arch of the entablature of the door,&#10;and moved not, nor spoke any word, but there became stationary and&#10;remained. And the door whereupon the shadow rested was, if I&#10;remember aright, over against the feet of the young Zoilus&#10;enshrouded. But we, the seven there assembled, having seen the&#10;shadow as it came out from among the draperies, dared not steadily&#10;behold it, but cast down our eyes, and gazed continually into the&#10;depths of the mirror of ebony. And at length I, Oinos, speaking&#10;some low words, demanded of the shadow its dwelling and its&#10;appellation. And the shadow answered, &#34;I am SHADOW, and my dwelling&#10;is near to the Catacombs of Ptolemais, and hard by those dim plains&#10;of Helusion which border upon the foul Charonian canal.&#34; And then&#10;did we, the seven, start from our seats in horror, and stand&#10;trembling, and shuddering, and aghast, for the tones in the voice&#10;of the shadow were not the tones of any one being, but of a&#10;multitude of beings, and, varying in their cadences from syllable&#10;to syllable fell duskly upon our ears in the well-remembered and&#10;familiar accents of many thousand departed friends.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 1, :source => 'feedbooks')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('The Devil in the Belfry'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;Everybody knows, in a general way, that the finest place in the&#10;world is&#8212;or, alas, was&#8212;the Dutch borough of Vondervotteimittiss.&#10;Yet as it lies some distance from any of the main roads, being in a&#10;somewhat out-of-the-way situation, there are perhaps very few of my&#10;readers who have ever paid it a visit. For the benefit of those who&#10;have not, therefore, it will be only proper that I should enter&#10;into some account of it. And this is indeed the more necessary, as&#10;with the hope of enlisting public sympathy in behalf of the&#10;inhabitants, I design here to give a history of the calamitous&#10;events which have so lately occurred within its limits. No one who&#10;knows me will doubt that the duty thus self-imposed will be&#10;executed to the best of my ability, with all that rigid&#10;impartiality, all that cautious examination into facts, and&#10;diligent collation of authorities, which should ever distinguish&#10;him who aspires to the title of historian.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;By the united aid of medals, manuscripts, and inscriptions, I am&#10;enabled to say, positively, that the borough of Vondervotteimittiss&#10;has existed, from its origin, in precisely the same condition which&#10;it at present preserves. Of the date of this origin, however, I&#10;grieve that I can only speak with that species of indefinite&#10;definiteness which mathematicians are, at times, forced to put up&#10;with in certain algebraic formulae. The date, I may thus say, in&#10;regard to the remoteness of its antiquity, cannot be less than any&#10;assignable quantity whatsoever.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Touching the derivation of the name Vondervotteimittiss, I&#10;confess myself, with sorrow, equally at fault. Among a multitude of&#10;opinions upon this delicate point&#8212;some acute, some learned, some&#10;sufficiently the reverse&#8212;I am able to select nothing which ought to&#10;be considered satisfactory. Perhaps the idea of Grogswigg- nearly&#10;coincident with that of Kroutaplenttey&#8212;is to be cautiously&#10;preferred.&#8212;It runs:&#8212;Vondervotteimittis&#8212;Vonder, lege&#10;Donder&#8212;Votteimittis, quasi und Bleitziz&#8212;Bleitziz obsol:&#8212;pro&#10;Blitzen.&#34; This derivative, to say the truth, is still countenanced&#10;by some traces of the electric fluid evident on the summit of the&#10;steeple of the House of the Town-Council. I do not choose, however,&#10;to commit myself on a theme of such importance, and must refer the&#10;reader desirous of information to the &#34;Oratiunculae de Rebus&#10;Praeter-Veteris,&#34; of Dundergutz. See, also, Blunderbuzzard &#34;De&#10;Derivationibus,&#34; pp. 27 to 5010, Folio, Gothic edit., Red and Black&#10;character, Catch-word and No Cypher; wherein consult, also,&#10;marginal notes in the autograph of Stuffundpuff, with the&#10;Sub-Commentaries of Gruntundguzzell.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Notwithstanding the obscurity which thus envelops the date of&#10;the foundation of Vondervotteimittis, and the derivation of its&#10;name, there can be no doubt, as I said before, that it has always&#10;existed as we find it at this epoch. The oldest man in the borough&#10;can remember not the slightest difference in the appearance of any&#10;portion of it; and, indeed, the very suggestion of such a&#10;possibility is considered an insult. The site of the village is in&#10;a perfectly circular valley, about a quarter of a mile in&#10;circumference, and entirely surrounded by gentle hills, over whose&#10;summit the people have never yet ventured to pass. For this they&#10;assign the very good reason that they do not believe there is&#10;anything at all on the other side.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Round the skirts of the valley (which is quite level, and paved&#10;throughout with flat tiles), extends a continuous row of sixty&#10;little houses. These, having their backs on the hills, must look,&#10;of course, to the centre of the plain, which is just sixty yards&#10;from the front door of each dwelling. Every house has a small&#10;garden before it, with a circular path, a sun-dial, and twenty-four&#10;cabbages. The buildings themselves are so precisely alike, that one&#10;can in no manner be distinguished from the other. Owing to the vast&#10;antiquity, the style of architecture is somewhat odd, but it is not&#10;for that reason the less strikingly picturesque. They are fashioned&#10;of hard-burned little bricks, red, with black ends, so that the&#10;walls look like a chess-board upon a great scale. The gables are&#10;turned to the front, and there are cornices, as big as all the rest&#10;of the house, over the eaves and over the main doors. The windows&#10;are narrow and deep, with very tiny panes and a great deal of sash.&#10;On the roof is a vast quantity of tiles with long curly ears. The&#10;woodwork, throughout, is of a dark hue and there is much carving&#10;about it, with but a trifling variety of pattern for, time out of&#10;mind, the carvers of Vondervotteimittiss have never been able to&#10;carve more than two objects&#8212;a time-piece and a cabbage. But these&#10;they do exceedingly well, and intersperse them, with singular&#10;ingenuity, wherever they find room for the chisel.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The dwellings are as much alike inside as out, and the furniture&#10;is all upon one plan. The floors are of square tiles, the chairs&#10;and tables of black-looking wood with thin crooked legs and puppy&#10;feet. The mantelpieces are wide and high, and have not only&#10;time-pieces and cabbages sculptured over the front, but a real&#10;time-piece, which makes a prodigious ticking, on the top in the&#10;middle, with a flower-pot containing a cabbage standing on each&#10;extremity by way of outrider. Between each cabbage and the&#10;time-piece, again, is a little China man having a large stomach&#10;with a great round hole in it, through which is seen the dial-plate&#10;of a watch.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The fireplaces are large and deep, with fierce crooked-looking&#10;fire-dogs. There is constantly a rousing fire, and a huge pot over&#10;it, full of sauer-kraut and pork, to which the good woman of the&#10;house is always busy in attending. She is a little fat old lady,&#10;with blue eyes and a red face, and wears a huge cap like a&#10;sugar-loaf, ornamented with purple and yellow ribbons. Her dress is&#10;of orange-colored linsey-woolsey, made very full behind and very&#10;short in the waist&#8212;and indeed very short in other respects, not&#10;reaching below the middle of her leg. This is somewhat thick, and&#10;so are her ankles, but she has a fine pair of green stockings to&#10;cover them. Her shoes&#8212;of pink leather&#8212;are fastened each with a&#10;bunch of yellow ribbons puckered up in the shape of a cabbage. In&#10;her left hand she has a little heavy Dutch watch; in her right she&#10;wields a ladle for the sauerkraut and pork. By her side there&#10;stands a fat tabby cat, with a gilt toy-repeater tied to its tail,&#10;which &#34;the boys&#34; have there fastened by way of a quiz.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The boys themselves are, all three of them, in the garden&#10;attending the pig. They are each two feet in height. They have&#10;three-cornered cocked hats, purple waistcoats reaching down to&#10;their thighs, buckskin knee-breeches, red stockings, heavy shoes&#10;with big silver buckles, long surtout coats with large buttons of&#10;mother-of-pearl. Each, too, has a pipe in his mouth, and a little&#10;dumpy watch in his right hand. He takes a puff and a look, and then&#10;a look and a puff. The pig&#8212;which is corpulent and lazy&#8212;is occupied&#10;now in picking up the stray leaves that fall from the cabbages, and&#10;now in giving a kick behind at the gilt repeater, which the urchins&#10;have also tied to his tail in order to make him look as handsome as&#10;the cat.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Right at the front door, in a high-backed leather-bottomed armed&#10;chair, with crooked legs and puppy feet like the tables, is seated&#10;the old man of the house himself. He is an exceedingly puffy little&#10;old gentleman, with big circular eyes and a huge double chin. His&#10;dress resembles that of the boys&#8212;and I need say nothing farther&#10;about it. All the difference is, that his pipe is somewhat bigger&#10;than theirs and he can make a greater smoke. Like them, he has a&#10;watch, but he carries his watch in his pocket. To say the truth, he&#10;has something of more importance than a watch to attend to&#8212;and what&#10;that is, I shall presently explain. He sits with his right leg upon&#10;his left knee, wears a grave countenance, and always keeps one of&#10;his eyes, at least, resolutely bent upon a certain remarkable&#10;object in the centre of the plain.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;This object is situated in the steeple of the House of the Town&#10;Council. The Town Council are all very little, round, oily,&#10;intelligent men, with big saucer eyes and fat double chins, and&#10;have their coats much longer and their shoe-buckles much bigger&#10;than the ordinary inhabitants of Vondervotteimittiss. Since my&#10;sojourn in the borough, they have had several special meetings, and&#10;have adopted these three important resolutions:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That it is wrong to alter the good old course of things:&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That there is nothing tolerable out of Vondervotteimittiss:&#34;&#10;and&#8212;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That we will stick by our clocks and our cabbages.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Above the session-room of the Council is the steeple, and in the&#10;steeple is the belfry, where exists, and has existed time out of&#10;mind, the pride and wonder of the village&#8212;the great clock of the&#10;borough of Vondervotteimittiss. And this is the object to which the&#10;eyes of the old gentlemen are turned who sit in the&#10;leather-bottomed arm-chairs.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The great clock has seven faces&#8212;one in each of the seven sides&#10;of the steeple&#8212;so that it can be readily seen from all quarters.&#10;Its faces are large and white, and its hands heavy and black. There&#10;is a belfry-man whose sole duty is to attend to it; but this duty&#10;is the most perfect of sinecures&#8212;for the clock of&#10;Vondervotteimittis was never yet known to have anything the matter&#10;with it. Until lately, the bare supposition of such a thing was&#10;considered heretical. From the remotest period of antiquity to&#10;which the archives have reference, the hours have been regularly&#10;struck by the big bell. And, indeed the case was just the same with&#10;all the other clocks and watches in the borough. Never was such a&#10;place for keeping the true time. When the large clapper thought&#10;proper to say &#34;Twelve o&#39;clock!&#34; all its obedient followers opened&#10;their throats simultaneously, and responded like a very echo. In&#10;short, the good burghers were fond of their sauer-kraut, but then&#10;they were proud of their clocks.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;All people who hold sinecure offices are held in more or less&#10;respect, and as the belfry&#8212;man of Vondervotteimittiss has the most&#10;perfect of sinecures, he is the most perfectly respected of any man&#10;in the world. He is the chief dignitary of the borough, and the&#10;very pigs look up to him with a sentiment of reverence. His&#10;coat-tail is very far longer&#8212;his pipe, his shoe&#8212;buckles, his eyes,&#10;and his stomach, very far bigger&#8212;than those of any other old&#10;gentleman in the village; and as to his chin, it is not only&#10;double, but triple.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I have thus painted the happy estate of Vondervotteimittiss:&#10;alas, that so fair a picture should ever experience a reverse!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There has been long a saying among the wisest inhabitants, that&#10;&#34;no good can come from over the hills&#34;; and it really seemed that&#10;the words had in them something of the spirit of prophecy. It&#10;wanted five minutes of noon, on the day before yesterday, when&#10;there appeared a very odd-looking object on the summit of the ridge&#10;of the eastward. Such an occurrence, of course, attracted universal&#10;attention, and every little old gentleman who sat in a&#10;leather-bottomed arm-chair turned one of his eyes with a stare of&#10;dismay upon the phenomenon, still keeping the other upon the clock&#10;in the steeple.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;By the time that it wanted only three minutes to noon, the droll&#10;object in question was perceived to be a very diminutive&#10;foreign-looking young man. He descended the hills at a great rate,&#10;so that every body had soon a good look at him. He was really the&#10;most finicky little personage that had ever been seen in&#10;Vondervotteimittiss. His countenance was of a dark snuff-color, and&#10;he had a long hooked nose, pea eyes, a wide mouth, and an excellent&#10;set of teeth, which latter he seemed anxious of displaying, as he&#10;was grinning from ear to ear. What with mustachios and whiskers,&#10;there was none of the rest of his face to be seen. His head was&#10;uncovered, and his hair neatly done up in papillotes. His dress was&#10;a tight-fitting swallow-tailed black coat (from one of whose&#10;pockets dangled a vast length of white handkerchief), black&#10;kerseymere knee-breeches, black stockings, and stumpy-looking&#10;pumps, with huge bunches of black satin ribbon for bows. Under one&#10;arm he carried a huge chapeau-de-bras, and under the other a fiddle&#10;nearly five times as big as himself. In his left hand was a gold&#10;snuff-box, from which, as he capered down the hill, cutting all&#10;manner of fantastic steps, he took snuff incessantly with an air of&#10;the greatest possible self-satisfaction. God bless me!&#8212;here was a&#10;sight for the honest burghers of Vondervotteimittiss!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;To speak plainly, the fellow had, in spite of his grinning, an&#10;audacious and sinister kind of face; and as he curvetted right into&#10;the village, the old stumpy appearance of his pumps excited no&#10;little suspicion; and many a burgher who beheld him that day would&#10;have given a trifle for a peep beneath the white cambric&#10;handkerchief which hung so obtrusively from the pocket of his&#10;swallow-tailed coat. But what mainly occasioned a righteous&#10;indignation was, that the scoundrelly popinjay, while he cut a&#10;fandango here, and a whirligig there, did not seem to have the&#10;remotest idea in the world of such a thing as keeping time in his&#10;steps.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The good people of the borough had scarcely a chance, however,&#10;to get their eyes thoroughly open, when, just as it wanted half a&#10;minute of noon, the rascal bounced, as I say, right into the midst&#10;of them; gave a chassez here, and a balancez there; and then, after&#10;a pirouette and a pas-de-zephyr, pigeon-winged himself right up&#10;into the belfry of the House of the Town Council, where the&#10;wonder-stricken belfry-man sat smoking in a state of dignity and&#10;dismay. But the little chap seized him at once by the nose; gave it&#10;a swing and a pull; clapped the big chapeau de-bras upon his head;&#10;knocked it down over his eyes and mouth; and then, lifting up the&#10;big fiddle, beat him with it so long and so soundly, that what with&#10;the belfry-man being so fat, and the fiddle being so hollow, you&#10;would have sworn that there was a regiment of double-bass drummers&#10;all beating the devil&#39;s tattoo up in the belfry of the steeple of&#10;Vondervotteimittiss.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There is no knowing to what desperate act of vengeance this&#10;unprincipled attack might have aroused the inhabitants, but for the&#10;important fact that it now wanted only half a second of noon. The&#10;bell was about to strike, and it was a matter of absolute and&#10;pre-eminent necessity that every body should look well at his&#10;watch. It was evident, however, that just at this moment the fellow&#10;in the steeple was doing something that he had no business to do&#10;with the clock. But as it now began to strike, nobody had any time&#10;to attend to his manoeuvres, for they had all to count the strokes&#10;of the bell as it sounded.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;One!&#34; said the clock.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Von!&#34; echoed every little old gentleman in every&#10;leather-bottomed arm-chair in Vondervotteimittiss. &#34;Von!&#34; said his&#10;watch also; &#34;von!&#34; said the watch of his vrow; and &#34;von!&#34; said the&#10;watches of the boys, and the little gilt repeaters on the tails of&#10;the cat and pig.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Two!&#34; continued the big bell; and&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Doo!&#34; repeated all the repeaters.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Three! Four! Five! Six! Seven! Eight! Nine! Ten!&#34; said the&#10;bell.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Dree! Vour! Fibe! Sax! Seben! Aight! Noin! Den!&#34; answered the&#10;others.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Eleven!&#34; said the big one.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Eleben!&#34; assented the little ones.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Twelve!&#34; said the bell.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Dvelf!&#34; they replied perfectly satisfied, and dropping their&#10;voices.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Und dvelf it is!&#34; said all the little old gentlemen, putting up&#10;their watches. But the big bell had not done with them yet.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Thirteen!&#34; said he.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Der Teufel!&#34; gasped the little old gentlemen, turning pale,&#10;dropping their pipes, and putting down all their right legs from&#10;over their left knees.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Der Teufel!&#34; groaned they, &#34;Dirteen! Dirteen!!&#8212;Mein Gott, it is&#10;Dirteen o&#39;clock!!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Why attempt to describe the terrible scene which ensued? All&#10;Vondervotteimittiss flew at once into a lamentable state of&#10;uproar.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Vot is cum&#39;d to mein pelly?&#34; roared all the boys&#8212;&#34;I&#39;ve been&#10;ongry for dis hour!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Vot is com&#39;d to mein kraut?&#34; screamed all the vrows, &#34;It has&#10;been done to rags for this hour!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Vot is cum&#39;d to mein pipe?&#34; swore all the little old gentlemen,&#10;&#34;Donder and Blitzen; it has been smoked out for dis hour!&#34;&#8212;and they&#10;filled them up again in a great rage, and sinking back in their&#10;arm-chairs, puffed away so fast and so fiercely that the whole&#10;valley was immediately filled with impenetrable smoke.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Meantime the cabbages all turned very red in the face, and it&#10;seemed as if old Nick himself had taken possession of every thing&#10;in the shape of a timepiece. The clocks carved upon the furniture&#10;took to dancing as if bewitched, while those upon the mantel-pieces&#10;could scarcely contain themselves for fury, and kept such a&#10;continual striking of thirteen, and such a frisking and wriggling&#10;of their pendulums as was really horrible to see. But, worse than&#10;all, neither the cats nor the pigs could put up any longer with the&#10;behavior of the little repeaters tied to their tails, and resented&#10;it by scampering all over the place, scratching and poking, and&#10;squeaking and screeching, and caterwauling and squalling, and&#10;flying into the faces, and running under the petticoats of the&#10;people, and creating altogether the most abominable din and&#10;confusion which it is possible for a reasonable person to conceive.&#10;And to make matters still more distressing, the rascally little&#10;scape-grace in the steeple was evidently exerting himself to the&#10;utmost. Every now and then one might catch a glimpse of the&#10;scoundrel through the smoke. There he sat in the belfry upon the&#10;belfry-man, who was lying flat upon his back. In his teeth the&#10;villain held the bell-rope, which he kept jerking about with his&#10;head, raising such a clatter that my ears ring again even to think&#10;of it. On his lap lay the big fiddle, at which he was scraping, out&#10;of all time and tune, with both hands, making a great show, the&#10;nincompoop! of playing &#34;Judy O&#39;Flannagan and Paddy O&#39;Rafferty.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Affairs being thus miserably situated, I left the place in&#10;disgust, and now appeal for aid to all lovers of correct time and&#10;fine kraut. Let us proceed in a body to the borough, and restore&#10;the ancient order of things in Vondervotteimittiss by ejecting that&#10;little fellow from the steeple.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 1, :source => 'feedbooks')

Who knoweth the&#10;mysteries of the will, with its vigor? For God is but a great will&#10;pervading all things by nature of its intentness. Man doth not&#10;yield himself to the angels, nor unto death utterly, save only&#10;through the weakness of his feeble will.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8212;Joseph Glanvill.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I Cannot, for my soul, remember how, when, or even precisely&#10;where, I first became acquainted with the lady Ligeia. Long years&#10;have since elapsed, and my memory is feeble through much suffering.&#10;Or, perhaps, I cannot now bring these points to mind, because, in&#10;truth, the character of my beloved, her rare learning, her singular&#10;yet placid cast of beauty, and the thrilling and enthralling&#10;eloquence of her low musical language, made their way into my heart&#10;by paces so steadily and stealthily progressive that they have been&#10;unnoticed and unknown. Yet I believe that I met her first and most&#10;frequently in some large, old, decaying city near the Rhine. Of her&#10;family&#8212;I have surely heard her speak. That it is of a remotely&#10;ancient date cannot be doubted. Ligeia! Ligeia! in studies of a&#10;nature more than all else adapted to deaden impressions of the&#10;outward world, it is by that sweet word alone&#8212;by Ligeia&#8212;that I&#10;bring before mine eyes in fancy the image of her who is no more.&#10;And now, while I write, a recollection flashes upon me that I have&#10;never known the paternal name of her who was my friend and my&#10;betrothed, and who became the partner of my studies, and finally&#10;the wife of my bosom. Was it a playful charge on the part of my&#10;Ligeia? or was it a test of my strength of affection, that I should&#10;institute no inquiries upon this point? or was it rather a caprice&#10;of my own&#8212;a wildly romantic offering on the shrine of the most&#10;passionate devotion? I but indistinctly recall the fact itself&#8212;what&#10;wonder that I have utterly forgotten the circumstances which&#10;originated or attended it? And, indeed, if ever she, the wan and&#10;the misty-winged Ashtophet of idolatrous Egypt, presided, as they&#10;tell, over marriages ill-omened, then most surely she presided over&#10;mine.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There is one dear topic, however, on which my memory falls me&#10;not. It is the person of Ligeia. In stature she was tall, somewhat&#10;slender, and, in her latter days, even emaciated. I would in vain&#10;attempt to portray the majesty, the quiet ease, of her demeanor, or&#10;the incomprehensible lightness and elasticity of her footfall. She&#10;came and departed as a shadow. I was never made aware of her&#10;entrance into my closed study save by the dear music of her low&#10;sweet voice, as she placed her marble hand upon my shoulder. In&#10;beauty of face no maiden ever equalled her. It was the radiance of&#10;an opium-dream&#8212;an airy and spirit-lifting vision more wildly divine&#10;than the phantasies which hovered vision about the slumbering souls&#10;of the daughters of Delos. Yet her features were not of that&#10;regular mould which we have been falsely taught to worship in the&#10;classical labors of the heathen. &#34;There is no exquisite beauty,&#34;&#10;says Bacon, Lord Verulam, speaking truly of all the forms and&#10;genera of beauty, without some strangeness in the proportion.&#34; Yet,&#10;although I saw that the features of Ligeia were not of a classic&#10;regularity&#8212;although I perceived that her loveliness was indeed&#10;&#34;exquisite,&#34; and felt that there was much of &#34;strangeness&#34;&#10;pervading it, yet I have tried in vain to detect the irregularity&#10;and to trace home my own perception of &#34;the strange.&#34; I examined&#10;the contour of the lofty and pale forehead&#8212;it was faultless&#8212;how&#10;cold indeed that word when applied to a majesty so divine!&#8212;the skin&#10;rivalling the purest ivory, the commanding extent and repose, the&#10;gentle prominence of the regions above the temples; and then the&#10;raven-black, the glossy, the luxuriant and naturally-curling&#10;tresses, setting forth the full force of the Homeric epithet,&#10;&#34;hyacinthine!&#34; I looked at the delicate outlines of the nose&#8212;and&#10;nowhere but in the graceful medallions of the Hebrews had I beheld&#10;a similar perfection. There were the same luxurious smoothness of&#10;surface, the same scarcely perceptible tendency to the aquiline,&#10;the same harmoniously curved nostrils speaking the free spirit. I&#10;regarded the sweet mouth. Here was indeed the triumph of all things&#10;heavenly&#8212;the magnificent turn of the short upper lip&#8212;the soft,&#10;voluptuous slumber of the under&#8212;the dimples which sported, and the&#10;color which spoke&#8212;the teeth glancing back, with a brilliancy almost&#10;startling, every ray of the holy light which fell upon them in her&#10;serene and placid, yet most exultingly radiant of all smiles. I&#10;scrutinized the formation of the chin&#8212;and here, too, I found the&#10;gentleness of breadth, the softness and the majesty, the fullness&#10;and the spirituality, of the Greek&#8212;the contour which the god Apollo&#10;revealed but in a dream, to Cleomenes, the son of the Athenian. And&#10;then I peered into the large eves of Ligeia.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For eyes we have no models in the remotely antique. It might&#10;have been, too, that in these eves of my beloved lay the secret to&#10;which Lord Verulam alludes. They were, I must believe, far larger&#10;than the ordinary eyes of our own race. They were even fuller than&#10;the fullest of the gazelle eyes of the tribe of the valley of&#10;Nourjahad. Yet it was only at intervals&#8212;in moments of intense&#10;excitement&#8212;that this peculiarity became more than slightly&#10;noticeable in Ligeia. And at such moments was her beauty&#8212;in my&#10;heated fancy thus it appeared perhaps&#8212;the beauty of beings either&#10;above or apart from the earth&#8212;the beauty of the fabulous Houri of&#10;the Turk. The hue of the orbs was the most brilliant of black, and,&#10;far over them, hung jetty lashes of great length. The brows,&#10;slightly irregular in outline, had the same tint. The&#10;&#34;strangeness,&#34; however, which I found in the eyes, was of a nature&#10;distinct from the formation, or the color, or the brilliancy of the&#10;features, and must, after all, be referred to the expression. Ah,&#10;word of no meaning! behind whose vast latitude of mere sound we&#10;intrench our ignorance of so much of the spiritual. The expression&#10;of the eyes of Ligeia! How for long hours have I pondered upon it!&#10;How have I, through the whole of a midsummer night, struggled to&#10;fathom it! What was it&#8212;that something more profound than the well&#10;of Democritus&#8212;which lay far within the pupils of my beloved? What&#10;was it? I was possessed with a passion to discover. Those eyes!&#10;those large, those shining, those divine orbs! they became to me&#10;twin stars of Leda, and I to them devoutest of astrologers.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There is no point, among the many incomprehensible anomalies of&#10;the science of mind, more thrillingly exciting than the fact&#8212;never,&#10;I believe, noticed in the schools&#8212;that, in our endeavors to recall&#10;to memory something long forgotten, we often find ourselves upon&#10;the very verge of remembrance, without being able, in the end, to&#10;remember. And thus how frequently, in my intense scrutiny of&#10;Ligeia&#39;s eyes, have I felt approaching the full knowledge of their&#10;expression&#8212;felt it approaching&#8212;yet not quite be mine&#8212;and so at&#10;length entirely depart! And (strange, oh strangest mystery of all!)&#10;I found, in the commonest objects of the universe, a circle of&#10;analogies to theat expression. I mean to say that, subsequently to&#10;the period when Ligeia&#39;s beauty passed into my spirit, there&#10;dwelling as in a shrine, I derived, from many existences in the&#10;material world, a sentiment such as I felt always aroused within me&#10;by her large and luminous orbs. Yet not the more could I define&#10;that sentiment, or analyze, or even steadily view it. I recognized&#10;it, let me repeat, sometimes in the survey of a rapidly-growing&#10;vine&#8212;in the contemplation of a moth, a butterfly, a chrysalis, a&#10;stream of running water. I have felt it in the ocean; in the&#10;falling of a meteor. I have felt it in the glances of unusually&#10;aged people. And there are one or two stars in heaven&#8212;(one&#10;especially, a star of the sixth magnitude, double and changeable,&#10;to be found near the large star in Lyra) in a telescopic scrutiny&#10;of which I have been made aware of the feeling. I have been filled&#10;with it by certain sounds from stringed instruments, and not&#10;unfrequently by passages from books. Among innumerable other&#10;instances, I well remember something in a volume of Joseph&#10;Glanvill, which (perhaps merely from its quaintness&#8212;who shall say?)&#10;never failed to inspire me with the sentiment;&#8212;&#34;And the will&#10;therein lieth, which dieth not. Who knoweth the mysteries of the&#10;will, with its vigor? For God is but a great will pervading all&#10;things by nature of its intentness. Man doth not yield him to the&#10;angels, nor unto death utterly, save only through the weakness of&#10;his feeble will.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Length of years, and subsequent reflection, have enabled me to&#10;trace, indeed, some remote connection between this passage in the&#10;English moralist and a portion of the character of Ligeia. An&#10;intensity in thought, action, or speech, was possibly, in her, a&#10;result, or at least an index, of that gigantic volition which,&#10;during our long intercourse, failed to give other and more&#10;immediate evidence of its existence. Of all the women whom I have&#10;ever known, she, the outwardly calm, the ever-placid Ligeia, was&#10;the most violently a prey to the tumultuous vultures of stern&#10;passion. And of such passion I could form no estimate, save by the&#10;miraculous expansion of those eyes which at once so delighted and&#10;appalled me&#8212;by the almost magical melody, modulation, distinctness&#10;and placidity of her very low voice&#8212;and by the fierce energy&#10;(rendered doubly effective by contrast with her manner of&#10;utterance) of the wild words which she habitually uttered.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I have spoken of the learning of Ligeia: it was immense&#8212;such as&#10;I have never known in woman. In the classical tongues was she&#10;deeply proficient, and as far as my own acquaintance extended in&#10;regard to the modern dialects of Europe, I have never known her at&#10;fault. Indeed upon any theme of the most admired, because simply&#10;the most abstruse of the boasted erudition of the academy, have I&#10;ever found Ligeia at fault? How singularly&#8212;how thrillingly, this&#10;one point in the nature of my wife has forced itself, at this late&#10;period only, upon my attention! I said her knowledge was such as I&#10;have never known in woman&#8212;but where breathes the man who has&#10;traversed, and successfully, all the wide areas of moral, physical,&#10;and mathematical science? I saw not then what I now clearly&#10;perceive, that the acquisitions of Ligeia were gigantic, were&#10;astounding; yet I was sufficiently aware of her infinite supremacy&#10;to resign myself, with a child-like confidence, to her guidance&#10;through the chaotic world of metaphysical investigation at which I&#10;was most busily occupied during the earlier years of our marriage.&#10;With how vast a triumph&#8212;with how vivid a delight&#8212;with how much of&#10;all that is ethereal in hope&#8212;did I feel, as she bent over me in&#10;studies but little sought&#8212;but less known&#8212;that delicious vista by&#10;slow degrees expanding before me, down whose long, gorgeous, and&#10;all untrodden path, I might at length pass onward to the goal of a&#10;wisdom too divinely precious not to be forbidden!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;How poignant, then, must have been the grief with which, after&#10;some years, I beheld my well-grounded expectations take wings to&#10;themselves and fly away! Without Ligeia I was but as a child&#10;groping benighted. Her presence, her readings alone, rendered&#10;vividly luminous the many mysteries of the transcendentalism in&#10;which we were immersed. Wanting the radiant lustre of her eyes,&#10;letters, lambent and golden, grew duller than Saturnian lead. And&#10;now those eyes shone less and less frequently upon the pages over&#10;which I pored. Ligeia grew ill. The wild eyes blazed with a too&#8212;too&#10;glorious effulgence; the pale fingers became of the transparent&#10;waxen hue of the grave, and the blue veins upon the lofty forehead&#10;swelled and sank impetuously with the tides of the gentle emotion.&#10;I saw that she must die&#8212;and I struggled desperately in spirit with&#10;the grim Azrael. And the struggles of the passionate wife were, to&#10;my astonishment, even more energetic than my own. There had been&#10;much in her stern nature to impress me with the belief that, to&#10;her, death would have come without its terrors;&#8212;but not so. Words&#10;are impotent to convey any just idea of the fierceness of&#10;resistance with which she wrestled with the Shadow. I groaned in&#10;anguish at the pitiable spectacle. would have soothed&#8212;I would have&#10;reasoned; but, in the intensity of her wild desire for life,&#8212;for&#10;life&#8212;but for life&#8212;solace and reason were the uttermost folly. Yet&#10;not until the last instance, amid the most convulsive writhings of&#10;her fierce spirit, was shaken the external placidity of her&#10;demeanor. Her voice grew more gentle&#8212;grew more low&#8212;yet I would not&#10;wish to dwell upon the wild meaning of the quietly uttered words.&#10;My brain reeled as I hearkened entranced, to a melody more than&#10;mortal&#8212;to assumptions and aspirations which mortality had never&#10;before known.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;That she loved me I should not have doubted; and I might have&#10;been easily aware that, in a bosom such as hers, love would have&#10;reigned no ordinary passion. But in death only, was I fully&#10;impressed with the strength of her affection. For long hours,&#10;detaining my hand, would she pour out before me the overflowing of&#10;a heart whose more than passionate devotion amounted to idolatry.&#10;How had I deserved to be so blessed by such confessions?&#8212;how had I&#10;deserved to be so cursed with the removal of my beloved in the hour&#10;of her making them, But upon this subject I cannot bear to dilate.&#10;Let me say only, that in Ligeia&#39;s more than womanly abandonment to&#10;a love, alas! all unmerited, all unworthily bestowed, I at length&#10;recognized the principle of her longing with so wildly earnest a&#10;desire for the life which was now fleeing so rapidly away. It is&#10;this wild longing&#8212;it is this eager vehemence of desire for life&#8212;but&#10;for life&#8212;that I have no power to portray&#8212;no utterance capable of&#10;expressing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At high noon of the night in which she departed, beckoning me,&#10;peremptorily, to her side, she bade me repeat certain verses&#10;composed by herself not many days before. I obeyed her.&#8212;They were&#10;these:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Lo! &#39;tis a gala night&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Within the lonesome latter years!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;An angel throng, bewinged, bedight&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In veils, and drowned in tears,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Sit in a theatre, to see&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A play of hopes and fears,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;While the orchestra breathes fitfully&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The music of the spheres.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mimes, in the form of God on high,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mutter and mumble low,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And hither and thither fly;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mere puppets they, who come and go&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At bidding of vast formless things&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;That shift the scenery to and fro,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Flapping from out their Condor wings&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Invisible Wo!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;That motley drama!&#8212;oh, be sure&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It shall not be forgot!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With its Phantom chased forever more,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;By a crowd that seize it not,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Through a circle that ever returneth in&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;To the self-same spot,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And much of Madness and more of Sin&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And Horror the soul of the plot.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But see, amid the mimic rout,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A crawling shape intrude!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A blood-red thing that writhes from out&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The scenic solitude!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It writhes!&#8212;it writhes!&#8212;with mortal pangs&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The mimes become its food,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And the seraphs sob at vermin fangs&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In human gore imbued.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Out&#8212;out are the lights&#8212;out all!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And over each quivering form,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The curtain, a funeral pall,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Comes down with the rush of a storm,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And the angels, all pallid and wan,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Uprising, unveiling, affirm&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;That the play is the tragedy, &#34;Man,&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And its hero the Conqueror Worm.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O God!&#34; half shrieked Ligeia, leaping to her feet and extending&#10;her arms aloft with a spasmodic movement, as I made an end of these&#10;lines&#8212;&#34;O God! O Divine Father!&#8212;shall these things be undeviatingly&#10;so?&#8212;shall this Conqueror be not once conquered? Are we not part and&#10;parcel in Thee? Who&#8212;who knoweth the mysteries of the will with its&#10;vigor? Man doth not yield him to the angels, nor unto death&#10;utterly, save only through the weakness of his feeble will.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And now, as if exhausted with emotion, she suffered her white&#10;arms to fall, and returned solemnly to her bed of death. And as she&#10;breathed her last sighs, there came mingled with them a low murmur&#10;from her lips. I bent to them my ear and distinguished, again, the&#10;concluding words of the passage in Glanvill&#8212;&#34;Man doth not yield him&#10;to the angels, nor unto death utterly, save only through the&#10;weakness of his feeble will.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She died;&#8212;and I, crushed into the very dust with sorrow, could&#10;no longer endure the lonely desolation of my dwelling in the dim&#10;and decaying city by the Rhine. I had no lack of what the world&#10;calls wealth. Ligeia had brought me far more, very far more than&#10;ordinarily falls to the lot of mortals. After a few months,&#10;therefore, of weary and aimless wandering, I purchased, and put in&#10;some repair, an abbey, which I shall not name, in one of the&#10;wildest and least frequented portions of fair England. The gloomy&#10;and dreary grandeur of the building, the almost savage aspect of&#10;the domain, the many melancholy and time-honored memories connected&#10;with both, had much in unison with the feelings of utter&#10;abandonment which had driven me into that remote and unsocial&#10;region of the country. Yet although the external abbey, with its&#10;verdant decay hanging about it, suffered but little alteration, I&#10;gave way, with a child-like perversity, and perchance with a faint&#10;hope of alleviating my sorrows, to a display of more than regal&#10;magnificence within.&#8212;For such follies, even in childhood, I had&#10;imbibed a taste and now they came back to me as if in the dotage of&#10;grief. Alas, I feel how much even of incipient madness might have&#10;been discovered in the gorgeous and fantastic draperies, in the&#10;solemn carvings of Egypt, in the wild cornices and furniture, in&#10;the Bedlam patterns of the carpets of tufted gold! I had become a&#10;bounden slave in the trammels of opium, and my labors and my orders&#10;had taken a coloring from my dreams. But these absurdities must not&#10;pause to detail. Let me speak only of that one chamber, ever&#10;accursed, whither in a moment of mental alienation, I led from the&#10;altar as my bride&#8212;as the successor of the unforgotten Ligeia&#8212;the&#10;fair-haired and blue-eyed Lady Rowena Trevanion, of Tremaine.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There is no individual portion of the architecture and&#10;decoration of that bridal chamber which is not now visibly before&#10;me. Where were the souls of the haughty family of the bride, when,&#10;through thirst of gold, they permitted to pass the threshold of an&#10;apartment so bedecked, a maiden and a daughter so beloved? I have&#10;said that I minutely remember the details of the chamber&#8212;yet I am&#10;sadly forgetful on topics of deep moment&#8212;and here there was no&#10;system, no keeping, in the fantastic display, to take hold upon the&#10;memory. The room lay in a high turret of the castellated abbey, was&#10;pentagonal in shape, and of capacious size. Occupying the whole&#10;southern face of the pentagon was the sole window&#8212;an immense sheet&#10;of unbroken glass from Venice&#8212;a single pane, and tinted of a leaden&#10;hue, so that the rays of either the sun or moon, passing through&#10;it, fell with a ghastly lustre on the objects within. Over the&#10;upper portion of this huge window, extended the trellice-work of an&#10;aged vine, which clambered up the massy walls of the turret. The&#10;ceiling, of gloomy-looking oak, was excessively lofty, vaulted, and&#10;elaborately fretted with the wildest and most grotesque specimens&#10;of a semi-Gothic, semi-Druidical device. From out the most central&#10;recess of this melancholy vaulting, depended, by a single chain of&#10;gold with long links, a huge censer of the same metal, Saracenic in&#10;pattern, and with many perforations so contrived that there writhed&#10;in and out of them, as if endued with a serpent vitality, a&#10;continual succession of parti-colored fires.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Some few ottomans and golden candelabra, of Eastern figure, were&#10;in various stations about&#8212;and there was the couch, too&#8212;bridal&#10;couch&#8212;of an Indian model, and low, and sculptured of solid ebony,&#10;with a pall-like canopy above. In each of the angles of the chamber&#10;stood on end a gigantic sarcophagus of black granite, from the&#10;tombs of the kings over against Luxor, with their aged lids full of&#10;immemorial sculpture. But in the draping of the apartment lay,&#10;alas! the chief phantasy of all. The lofty walls, gigantic in&#10;height&#8212;even unproportionably so&#8212;were hung from summit to foot, in&#10;vast folds, with a heavy and massive-looking tapestry&#8212;tapestry of a&#10;material which was found alike as a carpet on the floor, as a&#10;covering for the ottomans and the ebony bed, as a canopy for the&#10;bed, and as the gorgeous volutes of the curtains which partially&#10;shaded the window. The material was the richest cloth of gold. It&#10;was spotted all over, at irregular intervals, with arabesque&#10;figures, about a foot in diameter, and wrought upon the cloth in&#10;patterns of the most jetty black. But these figures partook of the&#10;true character of the arabesque only when regarded from a single&#10;point of view. By a contrivance now common, and indeed traceable to&#10;a very remote period of antiquity, they were made changeable in&#10;aspect. To one entering the room, they bore the appearance of&#10;simple monstrosities; but upon a farther advance, this appearance&#10;gradually departed; and step by step, as the visitor moved his&#10;station in the chamber, he saw himself surrounded by an endless&#10;succession of the ghastly forms which belong to the superstition of&#10;the Norman, or arise in the guilty slumbers of the monk. The&#10;phantasmagoric effect was vastly heightened by the artificial&#10;introduction of a strong continual current of wind behind the&#10;draperies&#8212;giving a hideous and uneasy animation to the whole.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In halls such as these&#8212;in a bridal chamber such as this&#8212;I&#10;passed, with the Lady of Tremaine, the unhallowed hours of the&#10;first month of our marriage&#8212;passed them with but little&#10;disquietude. That my wife dreaded the fierce moodiness of my&#10;temper&#8212;that she shunned me and loved me but little&#8212;I could not help&#10;perceiving; but it gave me rather pleasure than otherwise. I&#10;loathed her with a hatred belonging more to demon than to man. My&#10;memory flew back, (oh, with what intensity of regret!) to Ligeia,&#10;the beloved, the august, the beautiful, the entombed. I revelled in&#10;recollections of her purity, of her wisdom, of her lofty, her&#10;ethereal nature, of her passionate, her idolatrous love. Now, then,&#10;did my spirit fully and freely burn with more than all the fires of&#10;her own. In the excitement of my opium dreams (for I was habitually&#10;fettered in the shackles of the drug) I would call aloud upon her&#10;name, during the silence of the night, or among the sheltered&#10;recesses of the glens by day, as if, through the wild eagerness,&#10;the solemn passion, the consuming ardor of my longing for the&#10;departed, I could restore her to the pathway she had abandoned&#8212;ah,&#10;could it be forever?&#8212;upon the earth.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;About the commencement of the second month of the marriage, the&#10;Lady Rowena was attacked with sudden illness, from which her&#10;recovery was slow. The fever which consumed her rendered her nights&#10;uneasy; and in her perturbed state of half-slumber, she spoke of&#10;sounds, and of motions, in and about the chamber of the turret,&#10;which I concluded had no origin save in the distemper of her fancy,&#10;or perhaps in the phantasmagoric influences of the chamber itself.&#10;She became at length convalescent&#8212;finally well. Yet but a brief&#10;period elapsed, ere a second more violent disorder again threw her&#10;upon a bed of suffering; and from this attack her frame, at all&#10;times feeble, never altogether recovered. Her illnesses were, after&#10;this epoch, of alarming character, and of more alarming recurrence,&#10;defying alike the knowledge and the great exertions of her&#10;physicians. With the increase of the chronic disease which had&#10;thus, apparently, taken too sure hold upon her constitution to be&#10;eradicated by human means, I could not fall to observe a similar&#10;increase in the nervous irritation of her temperament, and in her&#10;excitability by trivial causes of fear. She spoke again, and now&#10;more frequently and pertinaciously, of the sounds&#8212;of the slight&#10;sounds&#8212;and of the unusual motions among the tapestries, to which&#10;she had formerly alluded.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;One night, near the closing in of September, she pressed this&#10;distressing subject with more than usual emphasis upon my&#10;attention. She had just awakened from an unquiet slumber, and I had&#10;been watching, with feelings half of anxiety, half of vague terror,&#10;the workings of her emaciated countenance. I sat by the side of her&#10;ebony bed, upon one of the ottomans of India. She partly arose, and&#10;spoke, in an earnest low whisper, of sounds which she then heard,&#10;but which I could not hear&#8212;of motions which she then saw, but which&#10;I could not perceive. The wind was rushing hurriedly behind the&#10;tapestries, and I wished to show her (what, let me confess it, I&#10;could not all believe) that those almost inarticulate breathings,&#10;and those very gentle variations of the figures upon the wall, were&#10;but the natural effects of that customary rushing of the wind. But&#10;a deadly pallor, overspreading her face, had proved to me that my&#10;exertions to reassure her would be fruitless. She appeared to be&#10;fainting, and no attendants were within call. I remembered where&#10;was deposited a decanter of light wine which had been ordered by&#10;her physicians, and hastened across the chamber to procure it. But,&#10;as I stepped beneath the light of the censer, two circumstances of&#10;a startling nature attracted my attention. I had felt that some&#10;palpable although invisible object had passed lightly by my person;&#10;and I saw that there lay upon the golden carpet, in the very middle&#10;of the rich lustre thrown from the censer, a shadow&#8212;a faint,&#10;indefinite shadow of angelic aspect&#8212;such as might be fancied for&#10;the shadow of a shade. But I was wild with the excitement of an&#10;immoderate dose of opium, and heeded these things but little, nor&#10;spoke of them to Rowena. Having found the wine, I recrossed the&#10;chamber, and poured out a gobletful, which I held to the lips of&#10;the fainting lady. She had now partially recovered, however, and&#10;took the vessel herself, while I sank upon an ottoman near me, with&#10;my eyes fastened upon her person. It was then that I became&#10;distinctly aware of a gentle footfall upon the carpet, and near the&#10;couch; and in a second thereafter, as Rowena was in the act of&#10;raising the wine to her lips, I saw, or may have dreamed that I&#10;saw, fall within the goblet, as if from some invisible spring in&#10;the atmosphere of the room, three or four large drops of a&#10;brilliant and ruby colored fluid. If this I saw&#8212;not so Rowena. She&#10;swallowed the wine unhesitatingly, and I forbore to speak to her of&#10;a circumstance which must, after all, I considered, have been but&#10;the suggestion of a vivid imagination, rendered morbidly active by&#10;the terror of the lady, by the opium, and by the hour.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Yet I cannot conceal it from my own perception that, immediately&#10;subsequent to the fall of the ruby-drops, a rapid change for the&#10;worse took place in the disorder of my wife; so that, on the third&#10;subsequent night, the hands of her menials prepared her for the&#10;tomb, and on the fourth, I sat alone, with her shrouded body, in&#10;that fantastic chamber which had received her as my bride.&#8212;Wild&#10;visions, opium-engendered, flitted, shadow-like, before me. I gazed&#10;with unquiet eye upon the sarcophagi in the angles of the room,&#10;upon the varying figures of the drapery, and upon the writhing of&#10;the parti-colored fires in the censer overhead. My eyes then fell,&#10;as I called to mind the circumstances of a former night, to the&#10;spot beneath the glare of the censer where I had seen the faint&#10;traces of the shadow. It was there, however, no longer; and&#10;breathing with greater freedom, I turned my glances to the pallid&#10;and rigid figure upon the bed. Then rushed upon me a thousand&#10;memories of Ligeia&#8212;and then came back upon my heart, with the&#10;turbulent violence of a flood, the whole of that unutterable wo&#10;with which I had regarded her thus enshrouded. The night waned; and&#10;still, with a bosom full of bitter thoughts of the one only and&#10;supremely beloved, I remained gazing upon the body of Rowena.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It might have been midnight, or perhaps earlier, or later, for I&#10;had taken no note of time, when a sob, low, gentle, but very&#10;distinct, startled me from my revery.&#8212;I felt that it came from the&#10;bed of ebony&#8212;the bed of death. I listened in an agony of&#10;superstitious terror&#8212;but there was no repetition of the sound. I&#10;strained my vision to detect any motion in the corpse&#8212;but there was&#10;not the slightest perceptible. Yet I could not have been deceived.&#10;I had heard the noise, however faint, and my soul was awakened&#10;within me. I resolutely and perseveringly kept my attention riveted&#10;upon the body. Many minutes elapsed before any circumstance&#10;occurred tending to throw light upon the mystery. At length it&#10;became evident that a slight, a very feeble, and barely noticeable&#10;tinge of color had flushed up within the cheeks, and along the&#10;sunken small veins of the eyelids. Through a species of unutterable&#10;horror and awe, for which the language of mortality has no&#10;sufficiently energetic expression, I felt my heart cease to beat,&#10;my limbs grow rigid where I sat. Yet a sense of duty finally&#10;operated to restore my self-possession. I could no longer doubt&#10;that we had been precipitate in our preparations&#8212;that Rowena still&#10;lived. It was necessary that some immediate exertion be made; yet&#10;turret was altogether apart from the portion of the abbey tenanted&#10;by the servants&#8212;there were none within call&#8212;I had no means of&#10;summoning them to my aid without leaving the room for many&#10;minutes&#8212;and this I could not venture to do. I therefore struggled&#10;alone in my endeavors to call back the spirit ill hovering. In a&#10;short period it was certain, however, that a relapse had taken&#10;place; the color disappeared from both eyelid and cheek, leaving a&#10;wanness even more than that of marble; the lips became doubly&#10;shrivelled and pinched up in the ghastly expression of death; a&#10;repulsive clamminess and coldness overspread rapidly the surface of&#10;the body; and all the usual rigorous illness immediately&#10;supervened. I fell back with a shudder upon the couch from which I&#10;had been so startlingly aroused, and again gave myself up to&#10;passionate waking visions of Ligeia.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;An hour thus elapsed when (could it be possible?) I was a second&#10;time aware of some vague sound issuing from the region of the bed.&#10;I listened&#8212;in extremity of horror. The sound came again&#8212;it was a&#10;sigh. Rushing to the corpse, I saw&#8212;distinctly saw&#8212;a tremor upon the&#10;lips. In a minute afterward they relaxed, disclosing a bright line&#10;of the pearly teeth. Amazement now struggled in my bosom with the&#10;profound awe which had hitherto reigned there alone. I felt that my&#10;vision grew dim, that my reason wandered; and it was only by a&#10;violent effort that I at length succeeded in nerving myself to the&#10;task which duty thus once more had pointed out. There was now a&#10;partial glow upon the forehead and upon the cheek and throat; a&#10;perceptible warmth pervaded the whole frame; there was even a&#10;slight pulsation at the heart. The lady lived; and with redoubled&#10;ardor I betook myself to the task of restoration. I chafed and&#10;bathed the temples and the hands, and used every exertion which&#10;experience, and no little. medical reading, could suggest. But in&#10;vain. Suddenly, the color fled, the pulsation ceased, the lips&#10;resumed the expression of the dead, and, in an instant afterward,&#10;the whole body took upon itself the icy chilliness, the livid hue,&#10;the intense rigidity, the sunken outline, and all the loathsome&#10;peculiarities of that which has been, for many days, a tenant of&#10;the tomb.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And again I sunk into visions of Ligeia&#8212;and again, (what marvel&#10;that I shudder while I write,) again there reached my ears a low&#10;sob from the region of the ebony bed. But why shall I minutely&#10;detail the unspeakable horrors of that night? Why shall I pause to&#10;relate how, time after time, until near the period of the gray&#10;dawn, this hideous drama of revivification was repeated; how each&#10;terrific relapse was only into a sterner and apparently more&#10;irredeemable death; how each agony wore the aspect of a struggle&#10;with some invisible foe; and how each struggle was succeeded by I&#10;know not what of wild change in the personal appearance of the&#10;corpse? Let me hurry to a conclusion.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The greater part of the fearful night had worn away, and she who&#10;had been dead, once again stirred&#8212;and now more vigorously than&#10;hitherto, although arousing from a dissolution more appalling in&#10;its utter hopelessness than any. I had long ceased to struggle or&#10;to move, and remained sitting rigidly upon the ottoman, a helpless&#10;prey to a whirl of violent emotions, of which extreme awe was&#10;perhaps the least terrible, the least consuming. The corpse, I&#10;repeat, stirred, and now more vigorously than before. The hues of&#10;life flushed up with unwonted energy into the countenance&#8212;the limbs&#10;relaxed&#8212;and, save that the eyelids were yet pressed heavily&#10;together, and that the bandages and draperies of the grave still&#10;imparted their charnel character to the figure, I might have&#10;dreamed that Rowena had indeed shaken off, utterly, the fetters of&#10;Death. But if this idea was not, even then, altogether adopted, I&#10;could at least doubt no longer, when, arising from the bed,&#10;tottering, with feeble steps, with closed eyes, and with the manner&#10;of one bewildered in a dream, the thing that was enshrouded&#10;advanced boldly and palpably into the middle of the apartment.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I trembled not&#8212;I stirred not&#8212;for a crowd of unutterable fancies&#10;connected with the air, the stature, the demeanor of the figure,&#10;rushing hurriedly through my brain, had paralyzed&#8212;had chilled me&#10;into stone. I stirred not&#8212;but gazed upon the apparition. There was&#10;a mad disorder in my thoughts&#8212;a tumult unappeasable. Could it,&#10;indeed, be the living Rowena who confronted me? Could it indeed be&#10;Rowena at all&#8212;the fair-haired, the blue-eyed Lady Rowena Trevanion&#10;of Tremaine? Why, why should I doubt it? The bandage lay heavily&#10;about the mouth&#8212;but then might it not be the mouth of the breathing&#10;Lady of Tremaine? And the cheeks-there were the roses as in her&#10;noon of life&#8212;yes, these might indeed be the fair cheeks of the&#10;living Lady of Tremaine. And the chin, with its dimples, as in&#10;health, might it not be hers?&#8212;but had she then grown taller since&#10;her malady? What inexpressible madness seized me with that thought?&#10;One bound, and I had reached her feet! Shrinking from my touch, she&#10;let fall from her head, unloosened, the ghastly cerements which had&#10;confined it, and there streamed forth, into the rushing atmosphere&#10;of the chamber, huge masses of long and dishevelled hair; it was&#10;blacker than the raven wings of the midnight! And now slowly opened&#10;the eyes of the figure which stood before me. &#34;Here then, at&#10;least,&#34; I shrieked aloud, &#34;can I never&#8212;can I never be&#10;mistaken&#8212;these are the full, and the black, and the wild eyes&#8212;of my&#10;lost love&#8212;of the lady&#8212;of the LADY LIGEIA.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 1, :source => 'feedbooks')

He might have measured six&#10;feet and a half, and an habitual stoop in the shoulders seemed to&#10;have been the necessary consequence of an altitude so&#10;enormous.&#8212;Superfluities in height were, however, more than&#10;accounted for by deficiencies in other respects. He was exceedingly&#10;thin; and might, as his associates asserted, have answered, when&#10;drunk, for a pennant at the mast-head, or, when sober, have served&#10;for a jib-boom. But these jests, and others of a similar nature,&#10;had evidently produced, at no time, any effect upon the&#10;cachinnatory muscles of the tar. With high cheek-bones, a large&#10;hawk-nose, retreating chin, fallen under-jaw, and huge protruding&#10;white eyes, the expression of his countenance, although tinged with&#10;a species of dogged indifference to matters and things in general,&#10;was not the less utterly solemn and serious beyond all attempts at&#10;imitation or description.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The younger seaman was, in all outward appearance, the converse&#10;of his companion. His stature could not have exceeded four feet. A&#10;pair of stumpy bow-legs supported his squat, unwieldy figure, while&#10;his unusually short and thick arms, with no ordinary fists at their&#10;extremities, swung off dangling from his sides like the fins of a&#10;sea-turtle. Small eyes, of no particular color, twinkled far back&#10;in his head. His nose remained buried in the mass of flesh which&#10;enveloped his round, full, and purple face; and his thick upper-lip&#10;rested upon the still thicker one beneath with an air of complacent&#10;self-satisfaction, much heightened by the owner&#39;s habit of licking&#10;them at intervals. He evidently regarded his tall shipmate with a&#10;feeling half-wondrous, half-quizzical; and stared up occasionally&#10;in his face as the red setting sun stares up at the crags of Ben&#10;Nevis.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Various and eventful, however, had been the peregrinations of&#10;the worthy couple in and about the different tap-houses of the&#10;neighbourhood during the earlier hours of the night. Funds even the&#10;most ample, are not always everlasting: and it was with empty&#10;pockets our friends had ventured upon the present hostelrie.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At the precise period, then, when this history properly&#10;commences, Legs, and his fellow Hugh Tarpaulin, sat, each with both&#10;elbows resting upon the large oaken table in the middle of the&#10;floor, and with a hand upon either cheek. They were eyeing, from&#10;behind a huge flagon of unpaid-for &#34;humming-stuff,&#34; the portentous&#10;words, &#34;No Chalk,&#34; which to their indignation and astonishment were&#10;scored over the doorway by means of that very mineral whose&#10;presence they purported to deny. Not that the gift of decyphering&#10;written characters&#8212;a gift among the commonalty of that day&#10;considered little less cabalistical than the art of inditing&#8212;could,&#10;in strict justice, have been laid to the charge of either disciple&#10;of the sea; but there was, to say the truth, a certain twist in the&#10;formation of the letters&#8212;an indescribable lee-lurch about the&#10;whole&#8212;which foreboded, in the opinion of both seamen, a long run of&#10;dirty weather; and determined them at once, in the allegorical&#10;words of Legs himself, to &#34;pump ship, clew up all sail, and scud&#10;before the wind.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Having accordingly disposed of what remained of the ale, and&#10;looped up the points of their short doublets, they finally made a&#10;bolt for the street. Although Tarpaulin rolled twice into the&#10;fire-place, mistaking it for the door, yet their escape was at&#10;length happily effected&#8212;and half after twelve o&#39;clock found our&#10;heroes ripe for mischief, and running for life down a dark alley in&#10;the direction of St. Andrew&#39;s Stair, hotly pursued by the landlady&#10;of the &#34;Jolly Tar.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At the epoch of this eventful tale, and periodically, for many&#10;years before and after, all England, but more especially the&#10;metropolis, resounded with the fearful cry of &#34;Plague!&#34; The city&#10;was in a great measure depopulated&#8212;and in those horrible regions,&#10;in the vicinity of the Thames, where amid the dark, narrow, and&#10;filthy lanes and alleys, the Demon of Disease was supposed to have&#10;had his nativity, Awe, Terror, and Superstition were alone to be&#10;found stalking abroad.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;By authority of the king such districts were placed under ban,&#10;and all persons forbidden, under pain of death, to intrude upon&#10;their dismal solitude. Yet neither the mandate of the monarch, nor&#10;the huge barriers erected at the entrances of the streets, nor the&#10;prospect of that loathsome death which, with almost absolute&#10;certainty, overwhelmed the wretch whom no peril could deter from&#10;the adventure, prevented the unfurnished and untenanted dwellings&#10;from being stripped, by the hand of nightly rapine, of every&#10;article, such as iron, brass, or lead-work, which could in any&#10;manner be turned to a profitable account.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Above all, it was usually found, upon the annual winter opening&#10;of the barriers, that locks, bolts, and secret cellars, had proved&#10;but slender protection to those rich stores of wines and liquors&#10;which, in consideration of the risk and trouble of removal, many of&#10;the numerous dealers having shops in the neighbourhood had&#10;consented to trust, during the period of exile, to so insufficient&#10;a security.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But there were very few of the terror-stricken people who&#10;attributed these doings to the agency of human hands. Pest-spirits,&#10;plague-goblins, and fever-demons, were the popular imps of&#10;mischief; and tales so blood-chilling were hourly told, that the&#10;whole mass of forbidden buildings was, at length, enveloped in&#10;terror as in a shroud, and the plunderer himself was often scared&#10;away by the horrors his own depreciations had created; leaving the&#10;entire vast circuit of prohibited district to gloom, silence,&#10;pestilence, and death.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was by one of the terrific barriers already mentioned, and&#10;which indicated the region beyond to be under the Pest-ban, that,&#10;in scrambling down an alley, Legs and the worthy Hugh Tarpaulin&#10;found their progress suddenly impeded. To return was out of the&#10;question, and no time was to be lost, as their pursuers were close&#10;upon their heels. With thorough-bred seamen to clamber up the&#10;roughly fashioned plank-work was a trifle; and, maddened with the&#10;twofold excitement of exercise and liquor, they leaped&#10;unhesitatingly down within the enclosure, and holding on their&#10;drunken course with shouts and yellings, were soon bewildered in&#10;its noisome and intricate recesses.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Had they not, indeed, been intoxicated beyond moral sense, their&#10;reeling footsteps must have been palsied by the horrors of their&#10;situation. The air was cold and misty. The paving-stones, loosened&#10;from their beds, lay in wild disorder amid the tall, rank grass,&#10;which sprang up around the feet and ankles. Fallen houses choked up&#10;the streets. The most fetid and poisonous smells everywhere&#10;prevailed;&#8212;and by the aid of that ghastly light which, even at&#10;midnight, never fails to emanate from a vapory and pestilential at&#10;atmosphere, might be discerned lying in the by-paths and alleys, or&#10;rotting in the windowless habitations, the carcass of many a&#10;nocturnal plunderer arrested by the hand of the plague in the very&#10;perpetration of his robbery.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8212; But it lay not in the power of images, or sensations, or&#10;impediments such as these, to stay the course of men who, naturally&#10;brave, and at that time especially, brimful of courage and of&#10;&#34;humming-stuff!&#34; would have reeled, as straight as their condition&#10;might have permitted, undauntedly into the very jaws of Death.&#10;Onward&#8212;still onward stalked the grim Legs, making the desolate&#10;solemnity echo and re-echo with yells like the terrific war-whoop&#10;of the Indian: and onward, still onward rolled the dumpy Tarpaulin,&#10;hanging on to the doublet of his more active companion, and far&#10;surpassing the latter&#39;s most strenuous exertions in the way of&#10;vocal music, by bull-roarings in basso, from the profundity of his&#10;stentorian lungs.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;They had now evidently reached the strong hold of the&#10;pestilence. Their way at every step or plunge grew more noisome and&#10;more horrible&#8212;the paths more narrow and more intricate. Huge stones&#10;and beams falling momently from the decaying roofs above them, gave&#10;evidence, by their sullen and heavy descent, of the vast height of&#10;the surrounding houses; and while actual exertion became necessary&#10;to force a passage through frequent heaps of rubbish, it was by no&#10;means seldom that the hand fell upon a skeleton or rested upon a&#10;more fleshly corpse.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Suddenly, as the seamen stumbled against the entrance of a tall&#10;and ghastly-looking building, a yell more than usually shrill from&#10;the throat of the excited Legs, was replied to from within, in a&#10;rapid succession of wild, laughter-like, and fiendish shrieks.&#10;Nothing daunted at sounds which, of such a nature, at such a time,&#10;and in such a place, might have curdled the very blood in hearts&#10;less irrevocably on fire, the drunken couple rushed headlong&#10;against the door, burst it open, and staggered into the midst of&#10;things with a volley of curses.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The room within which they found themselves proved to be the&#10;shop of an undertaker; but an open trap-door, in a corner of the&#10;floor near the entrance, looked down upon a long range of&#10;wine-cellars, whose depths the occasional sound of bursting bottles&#10;proclaimed to be well stored with their appropriate contents. In&#10;the middle of the room stood a table&#8212;in the centre of which again&#10;arose a huge tub of what appeared to be punch. Bottles of various&#10;wines and cordials, together with jugs, pitchers, and flagons of&#10;every shape and quality, were scattered profusely upon the board.&#10;Around it, upon coffin-tressels, was seated a company of six. This&#10;company I will endeavor to delineate one by one.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Fronting the entrance, and elevated a little above his&#10;companions, sat a personage who appeared to be the president of the&#10;table. His stature was gaunt and tall, and Legs was confounded to&#10;behold in him a figure more emaciated than himself. His face was as&#10;yellow as saffron&#8212;but no feature excepting one alone, was&#10;sufficiently marked to merit a particular description. This one&#10;consisted in a forehead so unusually and hideously lofty, as to&#10;have the appearance of a bonnet or crown of flesh superadded upon&#10;the natural head. His mouth was puckered and dimpled into an&#10;expression of ghastly affability, and his eyes, as indeed the eyes&#10;of all at table, were glazed over with the fumes of intoxication.&#10;This gentleman was clothed from head to foot in a&#10;richly-embroidered black silk-velvet pall, wrapped negligently&#10;around his form after the fashion of a Spanish cloak.&#8212;His head was&#10;stuck full of sable hearse-plumes, which he nodded to and fro with&#10;a jaunty and knowing air; and, in his right hand, he held a huge&#10;human thigh-bone, with which he appeared to have been just knocking&#10;down some member of the company for a song.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Opposite him, and with her back to the door, was a lady of no&#10;whit the less extraordinary character. Although quite as tall as&#10;the person just described, she had no right to complain of his&#10;unnatural emaciation. She was evidently in the last stage of a&#10;dropsy; and her figure resembled nearly that of the huge puncheon&#10;of October beer which stood, with the head driven in, close by her&#10;side, in a corner of the chamber. Her face was exceedingly round,&#10;red, and full; and the same peculiarity, or rather want of&#10;peculiarity, attached itself to her countenance, which I before&#10;mentioned in the case of the president&#8212;that is to say, only one&#10;feature of her face was sufficiently distinguished to need a&#10;separate characterization: indeed the acute Tarpaulin immediately&#10;observed that the same remark might have applied to each individual&#10;person of the party; every one of whom seemed to possess a monopoly&#10;of some particular portion of physiognomy. With the lady in&#10;question this portion proved to be the mouth. Commencing at the&#10;right ear, it swept with a terrific chasm to the left&#8212;the short&#10;pendants which she wore in either auricle continually bobbing into&#10;the aperture. She made, however, every exertion to keep her mouth&#10;closed and look dignified, in a dress consisting of a newly&#10;starched and ironed shroud coming up close under her chin, with a&#10;crimpled ruffle of cambric muslin.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At her right hand sat a diminutive young lady whom she appeared&#10;to patronise. This delicate little creature, in the trembling of&#10;her wasted fingers, in the livid hue of her lips, and in the slight&#10;hectic spot which tinged her otherwise leaden complexion, gave&#10;evident indications of a galloping consumption. An air of gave&#10;extreme haut ton, however, pervaded her whole appearance; she wore&#10;in a graceful and degage manner, a large and beautiful&#10;winding-sheet of the finest India lawn; her hair hung in ringlets&#10;over her neck; a soft smile played about her mouth; but her nose,&#10;extremely long, thin, sinuous, flexible and pimpled, hung down far&#10;below her under lip, and in spite of the delicate manner in which&#10;she now and then moved it to one side or the other with her tongue,&#10;gave to her countenance a somewhat equivocal expression.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Over against her, and upon the left of the dropsical lady, was&#10;seated a little puffy, wheezing, and gouty old man, whose cheeks&#10;reposed upon the shoulders of their owner, like two huge bladders&#10;of Oporto wine. With his arms folded, and with one bandaged leg&#10;deposited upon the table, he seemed to think himself entitled to&#10;some consideration. He evidently prided himself much upon every&#10;inch of his personal appearance, but took more especial delight in&#10;calling attention to his gaudy-colored surtout. This, to say the&#10;truth, must have cost him no little money, and was made to fit him&#10;exceedingly well&#8212;being fashioned from one of the curiously&#10;embroidered silken covers appertaining to those glorious&#10;escutcheons which, in England and elsewhere, are customarily hung&#10;up, in some conspicuous place, upon the dwellings of departed&#10;aristocracy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Next to him, and at the right hand of the president, was a&#10;gentleman in long white hose and cotton drawers. His frame shook,&#10;in a ridiculous manner, with a fit of what Tarpaulin called &#34;the&#10;horrors.&#34; His jaws, which had been newly shaved, were tightly tied&#10;up by a bandage of muslin; and his arms being fastened in a similar&#10;way at the wrists, I I prevented him from helping himself too&#10;freely to the liquors upon the table; a precaution rendered&#10;necessary, in the opinion of Legs, by the peculiarly sottish and&#10;wine-bibbing cast of his visage. A pair of prodigious ears,&#10;nevertheless, which it was no doubt found impossible to confine,&#10;towered away into the atmosphere of the apartment, and were&#10;occasionally pricked up in a spasm, at the sound of the drawing of&#10;a cork.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Fronting him, sixthly and lastly, was situated a singularly&#10;stiff-looking personage, who, being afflicted with paralysis, must,&#10;to speak seriously, have felt very ill at ease in his&#10;unaccommodating habiliments. He was habited, somewhat uniquely, in&#10;a new and handsome mahogany coffin. Its top or head-piece pressed&#10;upon the skull of the wearer, and extended over it in the fashion&#10;of a hood, giving to the entire face an air of indescribable&#10;interest. Arm-holes had been cut in the sides, for the sake not&#10;more of elegance than of convenience; but the dress, nevertheless,&#10;prevented its proprietor from sitting as erect as his associates;&#10;and as he lay reclining against his tressel, at an angle of&#10;forty-five degrees, a pair of huge goggle eyes rolled up their&#10;awful whites towards the celling in absolute amazement at their own&#10;enormity.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Before each of the party lay a portion of a skull, which was&#10;used as a drinking cup. Overhead was suspended a human skeleton, by&#10;means of a rope tied round one of the legs and fastened to a ring&#10;in the ceiling. The other limb, confined by no such fetter, stuck&#10;off from the body at right angles, causing the whole loose and&#10;rattling frame to dangle and twirl about at the caprice of every&#10;occasional puff of wind which found its way into the apartment. In&#10;the cranium of this hideous thing lay quantity of ignited charcoal,&#10;which threw a fitful but vivid light over the entire scene; while&#10;coffins, and other wares appertaining to the shop of an undertaker,&#10;were piled high up around the room, and against the windows,&#10;preventing any ray from escaping into the street.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At sight of this extraordinary assembly, and of their still more&#10;extraordinary paraphernalia, our two seamen did not conduct&#10;themselves with that degree of decorum which might have been&#10;expected. Legs, leaning against the wall near which he happened to&#10;be standing, dropped his lower jaw still lower than usual, and&#10;spread open his eyes to their fullest extent: while Hugh Tarpaulin,&#10;stooping down so as to bring his nose upon a level with the table,&#10;and spreading out a palm upon either knee, burst into a long, loud,&#10;and obstreperous roar of very ill-timed and immoderate&#10;laughter.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Without, however, taking offence at behaviour so excessively&#10;rude, the tall president smiled very graciously upon the&#10;intruders&#8212;nodded to them in a dignified manner with his head of&#10;sable plumes&#8212;and, arising, took each by an arm, and led him to a&#10;seat which some others of the company had placed in the meantime&#10;for his accommodation. Legs to all this offered not the slightest&#10;resistance, but sat down as he was directed; while tile gallant&#10;Hugh, removing his coffin tressel from its station near the head of&#10;the table, to the vicinity of the little consumptive lady in the&#10;winding sheet, plumped down by her side in high glee, and pouring&#10;out a skull of red wine, quaffed it to their better acquaintance.&#10;But at this presumption the stiff gentleman in the coffin seemed&#10;exceedingly nettled; and serious consequences might have ensued,&#10;had not the president, rapping upon the table with his truncheon,&#10;diverted the attention of all present to the following speech:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It becomes our duty upon the present happy occasion&#34; &#8212;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Avast there!&#34; interrupted Legs, looking very serious, &#34;avast&#10;there a bit, I say, and tell us who the devil ye all are, and what&#10;business ye have here, rigged off like the foul fiends, and&#10;swilling the snug blue ruin stowed away for the winter by my honest&#10;shipmate, Will Wimble the undertaker!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At this unpardonable piece of ill-breeding, all the original&#10;company half started to their feet, and uttered the same rapid&#10;succession of wild fiendish shrieks which had before caught the&#10;attention of the seamen. The president, however, was the first to&#10;recover his composure, and at length, turning to Legs with great&#10;dignity, recommenced:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Most willingly will we gratify any reasonable curiosity on the&#10;part of guests so illustrious, unbidden though they be. Know then&#10;that in these dominions I am monarch, and here rule with undivided&#10;empire under the title of &#39;King Pest the First.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;This apartment, which you no doubt profanely suppose to be the&#10;shop of Will Wimble the undertaker&#8212;a man whom we know not, and&#10;whose plebeian appellation has never before this night thwarted our&#10;royal ears&#8212;this apartment, I say, is the Dais-Chamber of our&#10;Palace, devoted to the councils of our kingdom, and to other sacred&#10;and lofty purposes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The noble lady who sits opposite is Queen Pest, our Serene&#10;Consort. The other exalted personages whom you behold are all of&#10;our family, and wear the insignia of the blood royal under the&#10;respective titles of &#39;His Grace the Arch Duke Pest-Iferous&#39;&#8212;&#39;His&#10;Grace the Duke Pest-Ilential&#39;&#8212;&#39;His Grace the Duke Tem-Pest&#39;&#8212;and&#10;&#39;Her Serene Highness the Arch Duchess Ana-Pest.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;As regards,&#34; continued he, &#34;your demand of the business upon&#10;which we sit here in council, we might be pardoned for replying&#10;that it concerns, and concerns alone, our own private and regal&#10;interest, and is in no manner important to any other than ourself.&#10;But in consideration of those rights to which as guests and&#10;strangers you may feel yourselves entitled, we will furthermore&#10;explain that we are here this night, prepared by deep research and&#10;accurate investigation, to examine, analyze, and thoroughly&#10;determine the indefinable spirit&#8212;the incomprehensible qualities and&#10;nature&#8212;of those inestimable treasures of the palate, the wines,&#10;ales, and liqueurs of this goodly metropolis: by so doing to&#10;advance not more our own designs than the true welfare of that&#10;unearthly sovereign whose reign is over us all, whose dominions are&#10;unlimited, and whose name is &#39;Death.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Whose name is Davy Jones!&#34; ejaculated Tarpaulin, helping the&#10;lady by his side to a skull of liqueur, and pouring out a second&#10;for himself.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Profane varlet!&#34; said the president, now turning his attention&#10;to the worthy Hugh, &#34;profane and execrable wretch!&#8212;we have said,&#10;that in consideration of those rights which, even in thy filthy&#10;person, we feel no inclination to violate, we have condescended to&#10;make reply to thy rude and unseasonable inquiries. We nevertheless,&#10;for your unhallowed intrusion upon our councils, believe it our&#10;duty to mulct thee and thy companion in each a gallon of Black&#10;Strap&#8212;having imbibed which to the prosperity of our kingdom&#8212;at a&#10;single draught&#8212;and upon your bended knees&#8212;ye shall be forthwith&#10;free either to proceed upon your way, or remain and be admitted to&#10;the privileges of our table, according to your respective and&#10;individual pleasures.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It would be a matter of utter impossibility,&#34; replied Legs,&#10;whom the assumptions and dignity of King Pest the First had&#10;evidently inspired some feelings of respect, and who arose and&#10;steadied himself by the table as he spoke&#8212;&#34;It would, please your&#10;majesty, be a matter of utter impossibility to stow away in my hold&#10;even one-fourth part of the same liquor which your majesty has just&#10;mentioned. To say nothing of the stuffs placed on board in the&#10;forenoon by way of ballast, and not to mention the various ales and&#10;liqueurs shipped this evening at different sea-ports, I have, at&#10;present, a full cargo of &#39;humming stuff&#39; taken in and duly paid for&#10;at the sign of the &#39;Jolly Tar.&#39; You will, therefore, please your&#10;majesty, be so good as to take the will for the deed&#8212;for by no&#10;manner of means either can I or will I swallow another drop&#8212;least&#10;of all a drop of that villainous bilge-water that answers to the&#10;hall of &#39;Black Strap.&#39;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Belay that!&#34; interrupted Tarpaulin, astonished not more at the&#10;length of his companion&#39;s speech than at the nature of his&#10;refusal&#8212;&#34;Belay that you tubber!&#8212;and I say, Legs, none of your&#10;palaver! My hull is still light, although I confess you yourself&#10;seem to be a little top-heavy; and as for the matter of your share&#10;of the cargo, why rather than raise a squall I would find&#10;stowageroom for it myself, but&#34; &#8212;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;This proceeding,&#34; interposed the president, &#34;is by no means in&#10;accordance with the terms of the mulct or sentence, which is in its&#10;nature Median, and not to be altered or recalled. The conditions we&#10;have imposed must be fulfilled to the letter, and that without a&#10;moment&#39;s hesitation&#8212;in failure of which fulfilment we decree that&#10;you do here be tied neck and heels together, and duly drowned as&#10;rebels in yon hogshead of October beer!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;A sentence!&#8212;a sentence!&#8212;a righteous and just sentence!&#8212;a&#10;glorious decree!&#8212;a most worthy and upright, and holy condemnation!&#34;&#10;shouted the Pest family altogether. The king elevated his forehead&#10;into innumerable wrinkles; the gouty little old man puffed like a&#10;pair of bellows; the lady of the winding sheet waved her nose to&#10;and fro; the gentleman in the cotton drawers pricked up his ears;&#10;she of the shroud gasped like a dying fish; and he of the coffin&#10;looked stiff and rolled up his eyes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ugh! ugh! ugh!&#34; chuckled Tarpaulin without heeding the general&#10;excitation, &#34;ugh! ugh! ugh!&#8212;ugh! ugh! ugh!&#8212;ugh! ugh! ugh!&#8212;I was&#10;saying,&#34; said he, &#34;I was saying when Mr. King Pest poked in his&#10;marlin-spike, that as for the matter of two or three gallons more&#10;or less of Black Strap, it was a trifle to a tight sea-boat like&#10;myself not overstowed&#8212;but when it comes to drinking the health of&#10;the Devil (whom God assoilzie) and going down upon my marrow bones&#10;to his ill-favored majesty there, whom I know, as well as I know&#10;myself to be a sinner, to be nobody in the whole world, but Tim&#10;Hurlygurly the stage-player&#8212;why! it&#39;s quite another guess sort of a&#10;thing, and utterly and altogether past my comprehension.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He was not allowed to finish this speech in tranquillity. At the&#10;name Tim Hurlygurly the whole assembly leaped from their name&#10;seats.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Treason!&#34; shouted his Majesty King Pest the First.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Treason!&#34; said the little man with the gout.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Treason!&#34; screamed the Arch Duchess Ana-Pest.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Treason!&#34; muttered the gentleman with his jaws tied up.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Treason!&#34; growled he of the coffin.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Treason! treason!&#34; shrieked her majesty of the mouth; and,&#10;seizing by the hinder part of his breeches the unfortunate&#10;Tarpaulin, who had just commenced pouring out for himself a skull&#10;of liqueur, she lifted him high into the air, and let him fall&#10;without ceremony into the huge open puncheon of his beloved ale.&#10;Bobbing up and down, for a few seconds, like an apple in a bowl of&#10;toddy, he, at length, finally disappeared amid the whirlpool of&#10;foam which, in the already effervescent liquor, his struggles&#10;easily succeeded in creating.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Not tamely, however, did the tall seaman behold the discomfiture&#10;of his companion. Jostling King Pest through the open trap, the&#10;valiant Legs slammed the door down upon him with an oath, and&#10;strode towards the centre of the room. Here tearing down the&#10;skeleton which swung over the table, he laid it about him with so&#10;much energy and good will, that, as the last glimpses of light died&#10;away within the apartment, he succeeded in knocking out the brains&#10;of the little gentleman with the gout. Rushing then with all his&#10;force against the fatal hogshead full of October ale and Hugh&#10;Tarpaulin, he rolled it over and over in an instant. Out burst a&#10;deluge of liquor so fierce&#8212;so impetuous&#8212;so overwhelming&#8212;that the&#10;room was flooded from wall to wall&#8212;the loaded table was&#10;overturned&#8212;the tressels were thrown upon their backs&#8212;the tub of&#10;punch into the fire-place&#8212;and the ladies into hysterics. Piles of&#10;death-furniture floundered about. Jugs, pitchers, and carboys&#10;mingled promiscuously in the melee, and wicker flagons encountered&#10;desperately with bottles of junk. The man with the horrors was&#10;drowned upon the spot-the little stiff gentleman floated off in his&#10;coffin&#8212;and the victorious Legs, seizing by the waist the fat lady&#10;in the shroud, rushed out with her into the street, and made a&#10;bee-line for the &#34;Free and Easy,&#34; followed under easy sail by the&#10;redoubtable Hugh Tarpaulin, who, having sneezed three or four&#10;times, panted and puffed after him with the Arch Duchess&#10;Ana-Pest.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 1, :source => 'feedbooks')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('How to Write a Blackwood Article'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;In the name of the prophets&#8212;figs!!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Cry of Turkish fig-peddler.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I presume everybody has heard of me. My name is the Signora&#10;Psyche Zenobia. This I know to be a fact. Nobody but my enemies&#10;ever calls me Suky Snobbs. I have been assured that Suky is but a&#10;vulgar corruption of Psyche, which is good Greek, and means &#34;the&#10;soul&#34; (that&#39;s me, I&#39;m all soul) and sometimes &#34;a butterfly,&#34; which&#10;latter meaning undoubtedly alludes to my appearance in my new&#10;crimson satin dress, with the sky-blue Arabian mantelet, and the&#10;trimmings of green agraffas, and the seven flounces of&#10;orange-colored auriculas. As for Snobbs&#8212;any person who should look&#10;at me would be instantly aware that my name wasn&#39;t Snobbs. Miss&#10;Tabitha Turnip propagated that report through sheer envy. Tabitha&#10;Turnip indeed! Oh the little wretch! But what can we expect from a&#10;turnip? Wonder if she remembers the old adage about &#34;blood out of a&#10;turnip,&#34; &#38;amp;c.? [Mem. put her in mind of it the first&#10;opportunity.] [Mem. again&#8212;pull her nose.] Where was I? Ah! I have&#10;been assured that Snobbs is a mere corruption of Zenobia, and that&#10;Zenobia was a queen&#8212;(So am I. Dr. Moneypenny always calls me the&#10;Queen of the Hearts)&#8212;and that Zenobia, as well as Psyche, is good&#10;Greek, and that my father was &#34;a Greek,&#34; and that consequently I&#10;have a right to our patronymic, which is Zenobia and not by any&#10;means Snobbs. Nobody but Tabitha Turnip calls me Suky Snobbs. I am&#10;the Signora Psyche Zenobia.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As I said before, everybody has heard of me. I am that very&#10;Signora Psyche Zenobia, so justly celebrated as corresponding&#10;secretary to the &#34;Philadelphia, Regular, Exchange, Tea, Total,&#10;Young, Belles, Lettres, Universal, Experimental, Bibliographical,&#10;Association, To, Civilize, Humanity.&#34; Dr. Moneypenny made the title&#10;for us, and says he chose it because it sounded big like an empty&#10;rum-puncheon. (A vulgar man that sometimes&#8212;but he&#39;s deep.) We all&#10;sign the initials of the society after our names, in the fashion of&#10;the R. S. A., Royal Society of Arts&#8212;the S. D. U. K., Society for&#10;the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, &#38;amp;c, &#38;amp;c. Dr. Moneypenny&#10;says that S. stands for stale, and that D. U. K. spells duck, (but&#10;it don&#39;t,) that S. D. U. K. stands for Stale Duck and not for Lord&#10;Brougham&#39;s society&#8212;but then Dr. Moneypenny is such a queer man that&#10;I am never sure when he is telling me the truth. At any rate we&#10;always add to our names the initials P. R. E. T. T. Y. B. L. U. E.&#10;B. A. T. C. H.- that is to say, Philadelphia, Regular, Exchange,&#10;Tea, Total, Young, Belles, Lettres, Universal, Experimental,&#10;Bibliographical, Association, To, Civilize, Humanity&#8212;one letter for&#10;each word, which is a decided improvement upon Lord Brougham. Dr.&#10;Moneypenny will have it that our initials give our true&#10;character&#8212;but for my life I can&#39;t see what he means.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Notwithstanding the good offices of the Doctor, and the&#10;strenuous exertions of the association to get itself into notice,&#10;it met with no very great success until I joined it. The truth is,&#10;the members indulged in too flippant a tone of discussion. The&#10;papers read every Saturday evening were characterized less by depth&#10;than buffoonery. They were all whipped syllabub. There was no&#10;investigation of first causes, first principles. There was no&#10;investigation of any thing at all. There was no attention paid to&#10;that great point, the &#34;fitness of things.&#34; In short there was no&#10;fine writing like this. It was all low&#8212;very! No profundity, no&#10;reading, no metaphysics&#8212;nothing which the learned call&#10;spirituality, and which the unlearned choose to stigmatize as cant.&#10;[Dr. M. says I ought to spell &#34;cant&#34; with a capital K&#8212;but I know&#10;better.]&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When I joined the society it was my endeavor to introduce a&#10;better style of thinking and writing, and all the world knows how&#10;well I have succeeded. We get up as good papers now in the P. R. E.&#10;T. T. Y. B. L. U. E. B. A. T. C. H. as any to be found even in&#10;Blackwood. I say, Blackwood, because I have been assured that the&#10;finest writing, upon every subject, is to be discovered in the&#10;pages of that justly celebrated Magazine. We now take it for our&#10;model upon all themes, and are getting into rapid notice&#10;accordingly. And, after all, it&#39;s not so very difficult a matter to&#10;compose an article of the genuine Blackwood stamp, if one only goes&#10;properly about it. Of course I don&#39;t speak of the political&#10;articles. Everybody knows how they are managed, since Dr.&#10;Moneypenny explained it. Mr. Blackwood has a pair of&#10;tailor&#39;s-shears, and three apprentices who stand by him for orders.&#10;One hands him the &#34;Times,&#34; another the &#34;Examiner&#34; and a third a&#10;&#34;Culley&#39;s New Compendium of Slang-Whang.&#34; Mr. B. merely cuts out&#10;and intersperses. It is soon done&#8212;nothing but &#34;Examiner,&#34;&#10;&#34;Slang-Whang,&#34; and &#34;Times&#34;&#8212;then &#34;Times,&#34; &#34;Slang-Whang,&#34; and&#10;&#34;Examiner&#34;&#8212;and then &#34;Times,&#34; &#34;Examiner,&#34; and &#34;Slang-Whang.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But the chief merit of the Magazine lies in its miscellaneous&#10;articles; and the best of these come under the head of what Dr.&#10;Moneypenny calls the bizarreries (whatever that may mean) and what&#10;everybody else calls the intensities. This is a species of writing&#10;which I have long known how to appreciate, although it is only&#10;since my late visit to Mr. Blackwood (deputed by the society) that&#10;I have been made aware of the exact method of composition. This&#10;method is very simple, but not so much so as the politics. Upon my&#10;calling at Mr. B.&#39;s, and making known to him the wishes of the&#10;society, he received me with great civility, took me into his&#10;study, and gave me a clear explanation of the whole process.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My dear madam,&#34; said he, evidently struck with my majestic&#10;appearance, for I had on the crimson satin, with the green&#10;agraffas, and orange-colored auriclas. &#34;My dear madam,&#34; said he,&#10;&#34;sit down. The matter stands thus: In the first place your writer&#10;of intensities must have very black ink, and a very big pen, with a&#10;very blunt nib. And, mark me, Miss Psyche Zenobia!&#34; he continued,&#10;after a pause, with the most expressive energy and solemnity of&#10;manner, &#34;mark me!&#8212;that pen&#8212;must&#8212;never be mended! Herein, madam,&#10;lies the secret, the soul, of intensity. I assume upon myself to&#10;say, that no individual, of however great genius ever wrote with a&#10;good pen&#8212;understand me,&#8212;a good article. You may take, it for&#10;granted, that when manuscript can be read it is never worth&#10;reading. This is a leading principle in our faith, to which if you&#10;cannot readily assent, our conference is at an end.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He paused. But, of course, as I had no wish to put an end to the&#10;conference, I assented to a proposition so very obvious, and one,&#10;too, of whose truth I had all along been sufficiently aware. He&#10;seemed pleased, and went on with his instructions.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It may appear invidious in me, Miss Psyche Zenobia, to refer&#10;you to any article, or set of articles, in the way of model or&#10;study, yet perhaps I may as well call your attention to a few&#10;cases. Let me see. There was &#39;The Dead Alive,&#39; a capital thing!&#8212;the&#10;record of a gentleman&#39;s sensations when entombed before the breath&#10;was out of his body&#8212;full of tastes, terror, sentiment, metaphysics,&#10;and erudition. You would have sworn that the writer had been born&#10;and brought up in a coffin. Then we had the &#39;Confessions of an&#10;Opium-eater&#39;&#8212;fine, very fine!&#8212;glorious imagination&#8212;deep philosophy&#10;acute speculation&#8212;plenty of fire and fury, and a good spicing of&#10;the decidedly unintelligible. That was a nice bit of flummery, and&#10;went down the throats of the people delightfully. They would have&#10;it that Coleridge wrote the paper&#8212;but not so. It was composed by my&#10;pet baboon, Juniper, over a rummer of Hollands and water, &#39;hot,&#10;without sugar.&#39;&#34; [This I could scarcely have believed had it been&#10;anybody but Mr. Blackwood, who assured me of it.] &#34;Then there was&#10;&#39;The Involuntary Experimentalist,&#39; all about a gentleman who got&#10;baked in an oven, and came out alive and well, although certainly&#10;done to a turn. And then there was &#39;The Diary of a Late Physician,&#39;&#10;where the merit lay in good rant, and indifferent Greek- both of&#10;them taking things with the public. And then there was &#39;The Man in&#10;the Bell,&#39; a paper by-the-by, Miss Zenobia, which I cannot&#10;sufficiently recommend to your attention. It is the history of a&#10;young person who goes to sleep under the clapper of a church bell,&#10;and is awakened by its tolling for a funeral. The sound drives him&#10;mad, and, accordingly, pulling out his tablets, he gives a record&#10;of his sensations. Sensations are the great things after all.&#10;Should you ever be drowned or hung, be sure and make a note of your&#10;sensations&#8212;they will be worth to you ten guineas a sheet. If you&#10;wish to write forcibly, Miss Zenobia, pay minute attention to the&#10;sensations.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That I certainly will, Mr. Blackwood,&#34; said I.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Good!&#34; he replied. &#34;I see you are a pupil after my own heart.&#10;But I must put you au fait to the details necessary in composing&#10;what may be denominated a genuine Blackwood article of the&#10;sensation stamp&#8212;the kind which you will understand me to say I&#10;consider the best for all purposes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The first thing requisite is to get yourself into such a scrape&#10;as no one ever got into before. The oven, for instance,&#8212;that was a&#10;good hit. But if you have no oven or big bell, at hand, and if you&#10;cannot conveniently tumble out of a balloon, or be swallowed up in&#10;an earthquake, or get stuck fast in a chimney, you will have to be&#10;contented with simply imagining some similar misadventure. I should&#10;prefer, however, that you have the actual fact to bear you out.&#10;Nothing so well assists the fancy, as an experimental knowledge of&#10;the matter in hand. &#39;Truth is strange,&#39; you know, &#39;stranger than&#10;fiction&#39;- besides being more to the purpose.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Here I assured him I had an excellent pair of garters, and would&#10;go and hang myself forthwith.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Good!&#34; he replied, &#34;do so;&#8212;although hanging is somewhat&#10;hacknied. Perhaps you might do better. Take a dose of Brandreth&#39;s&#10;pills, and then give us your sensations. However, my instructions&#10;will apply equally well to any variety of misadventure, and in your&#10;way home you may easily get knocked in the head, or run over by an&#10;omnibus, or bitten by a mad dog, or drowned in a gutter. But to&#10;proceed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Having determined upon your subject, you must next consider the&#10;tone, or manner, of your narration. There is the tone didactic, the&#10;tone enthusiastic, the tone natural&#8212;all common&#8212;place enough. But&#10;then there is the tone laconic, or curt, which has lately come much&#10;into use. It consists in short sentences. Somehow thus: Can&#39;t be&#10;too brief. Can&#39;t be too snappish. Always a full stop. And never a&#10;paragraph.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Then there is the tone elevated, diffusive, and interjectional.&#10;Some of our best novelists patronize this tone. The words must be&#10;all in a whirl, like a humming-top, and make a noise very similar,&#10;which answers remarkably well instead of meaning. This is the best&#10;of all possible styles where the writer is in too great a hurry to&#10;think.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The tone metaphysical is also a good one. If you know any big&#10;words this is your chance for them. Talk of the Ionic and Eleatic&#10;schools- of Archytas, Gorgias, and Alcmaeon. Say something about&#10;objectivity and subjectivity. Be sure and abuse a man named Locke.&#10;Turn up your nose at things in general, and when you let slip any&#10;thing a little too absurd, you need not be at the trouble of&#10;scratching it out, but just add a footnote and say that you are&#10;indebted for the above profound observation to the &#39;Kritik der&#10;reinem Vernunft,&#39; or to the &#39;Metaphysithe Anfongsgrunde der&#10;Noturwissenchaft.&#39; This would look erudite and&#8212;and&#8212;and frank.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;There are various other tones of equal celebrity, but I shall&#10;mention only two more&#8212;the tone transcendental and the tone&#10;heterogeneous. In the former the merit consists in seeing into the&#10;nature of affairs a very great deal farther than anybody else. This&#10;second sight is very efficient when properly managed. A little&#10;reading of the &#39;Dial&#39; will carry you a great way. Eschew, in this&#10;case, big words; get them as small as possible, and write them&#10;upside down. Look over Channing&#39;s poems and quote what he says&#10;about a &#39;fat little man with a delusive show of Can.&#39; Put in&#10;something about the Supernal Oneness. Don&#39;t say a syllable about&#10;the Infernal Twoness. Above all, study innuendo. Hint&#10;everything&#8212;assert nothing. If you feel inclined to say &#39;bread and&#10;butter,&#39; do not by any means say it outright. You may say any thing&#10;and every thing approaching to &#39;bread and butter.&#39; You may hint at&#10;buck-wheat cake, or you may even go so far as to insinuate oat-meal&#10;porridge, but if bread and butter be your real meaning, be&#10;cautious, my dear Miss Psyche, not on any account to say &#39;bread and&#10;butter!&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I assured him that I should never say it again as long as I&#10;lived. He kissed me and continued:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;As for the tone heterogeneous, it is merely a judicious&#10;mixture, in equal proportions, of all the other tones in the world,&#10;and is consequently made up of every thing deep, great, odd,&#10;piquant, pertinent, and pretty.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Let us suppose now you have determined upon your incidents and&#10;tone. The most important portion&#8212;in fact, the soul of the whole&#10;business, is yet to be attended to&#8212;I allude to the filling up. It&#10;is not to be supposed that a lady, or gentleman either, has been&#10;leading the life of a book worm. And yet above all things it is&#10;necessary that your article have an air of erudition, or at least&#10;afford evidence of extensive general reading. Now I&#39;ll put you in&#10;the way of accomplishing this point. See here!&#34; (pulling down some&#10;three or four ordinary-looking volumes, and opening them at&#10;random). &#34;By casting your eye down almost any page of any book in&#10;the world, you will be able to perceive at once a host of little&#10;scraps of either learning or bel-espritism, which are the very&#10;thing for the spicing of a Blackwood article. You might as well&#10;note down a few while I read them to you. I shall make two&#10;divisions: first, Piquant Facts for the Manufacture of Similes,&#10;and, second, Piquant Expressions to be introduced as occasion may&#10;require. Write now!&#34;&#8212;and I wrote as he dictated.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;PIQUANT FACTS FOR SIMILES. &#39;There were originally but three&#10;Muses&#8212;Melete, Mneme, Aoede&#8212;meditation, memory, and singing.&#39; You&#10;may make a good deal of that little fact if properly worked. You&#10;see it is not generally known, and looks recherche. You must be&#10;careful and give the thing with a downright improviso air.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Again. &#39;The river Alpheus passed beneath the sea, and emerged&#10;without injury to the purity of its waters.&#39; Rather stale that, to&#10;be sure, but, if properly dressed and dished up, will look quite as&#10;fresh as ever.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Here is something better. &#39;The Persian Iris appears to some&#10;persons to possess a sweet and very powerful perfume, while to&#10;others it is perfectly scentless.&#39; Fine that, and very delicate!&#10;Turn it about a little, and it will do wonders. We&#39;ll have some&#10;thing else in the botanical line. There&#39;s nothing goes down so&#10;well, especially with the help of a little Latin. Write!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;&#39;The Epidendrum Flos Aeris, of Java, bears a very beautiful&#10;flower, and will live when pulled up by the roots. The natives&#10;suspend it by a cord from the ceiling, and enjoy its fragrance for&#10;years.&#39; That&#39;s capital! That will do for the similes. Now for the&#10;Piquant Expressions.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;PIQUANT EXPRESSIONS. &#39;The Venerable Chinese novel Ju-Kiao-Li.&#39;&#10;Good! By introducing these few words with dexterity you will evince&#10;your intimate acquaintance with the language and literature of the&#10;Chinese. With the aid of this you may either get along without&#10;either Arabic, or Sanscrit, or Chickasaw. There is no passing&#10;muster, however, without Spanish, Italian, German, Latin, and&#10;Greek. I must look you out a little specimen of each. Any scrap&#10;will answer, because you must depend upon your own ingenuity to&#10;make it fit into your article. Now write!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;&#39;Aussi tendre que Zaire&#39;&#8212;as tender as Zaire-French. Alludes to&#10;the frequent repetition of the phrase, la tendre Zaire, in the&#10;French tragedy of that name. Properly introduced, will show not&#10;only your knowledge of the language, but your general reading and&#10;wit. You can say, for instance, that the chicken you were eating&#10;(write an article about being choked to death by a chicken-bone)&#10;was not altogether aussi tendre que Zaire. Write!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Van muerte tan escondida,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Que no te sienta venir,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Porque el plazer del morir,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;No mestorne a dar la vida.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That&#39;s Spanish&#8212;from Miguel de Cervantes. &#39;Come quickly, O&#10;death! but be sure and don&#39;t let me see you coming, lest the&#10;pleasure I shall feel at your appearance should unfortunately bring&#10;me back again to life.&#39; This you may slip in quite a propos when&#10;you are struggling in the last agonies with the chicken-bone.&#10;Write!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Il pover &#39;huomo che non se&#39;n era accorto,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Andava combattendo, e era morto.&#39; That&#39;s Italian, you&#10;perceive&#8212;from Ariosto. It means that a great hero, in the heat of&#10;combat, not perceiving that he had been fairly killed, continued to&#10;fight valiantly, dead as he was. The application of this to your&#10;own case is obvious&#8212;for I trust, Miss Psyche, that you will not&#10;neglect to kick for at least an hour and a half after you have been&#10;choked to death by that chicken-bone. Please to write!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Und sterb&#39;ich doch, no sterb&#39;ich denn&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Durch sie&#8212;durch sie!&#39; That&#39;s German&#8212;from Schiller. &#39;And if I&#10;die, at least I die&#8212;for thee&#8212;for thee!&#39; Here it is clear that you&#10;are apostrophizing the cause of your disaster, the chicken. Indeed&#10;what gentleman (or lady either) of sense, wouldn&#39;t die, I should&#10;like to know, for a well fattened capon of the right Molucca breed,&#10;stuffed with capers and mushrooms, and served up in a salad-bowl,&#10;with orange-jellies en mosaiques. Write! (You can get them that way&#10;at Tortoni&#39;s)&#8212;Write, if you please!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Here is a nice little Latin phrase, and rare too, (one can&#39;t be&#10;too recherche or brief in one&#39;s Latin, it&#39;s getting so&#10;common&#8212;ignoratio elenchi. He has committed an ignoratio&#10;elenchi&#8212;that is to say, he has understood the words of your&#10;proposition, but not the idea. The man was a fool, you see. Some&#10;poor fellow whom you address while choking with that chicken-bone,&#10;and who therefore didn&#39;t precisely understand what you were talking&#10;about. Throw the ignoratio elenchi in his teeth, and, at once, you&#10;have him annihilated. If he dares to reply, you can tell him from&#10;Lucan (here it is) that speeches are mere anemonae verborum,&#10;anemone words. The anemone, with great brilliancy, has no smell.&#10;Or, if he begins to bluster, you may be down upon him with insomnia&#10;Jovis, reveries of Jupiter&#8212;a phrase which Silius Italicus (see&#10;here!) applies to thoughts pompous and inflated. This will be sure&#10;and cut him to the heart. He can do nothing but roll over and die.&#10;Will you be kind enough to write?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;In Greek we must have some thing pretty&#8212;from Demosthenes, for&#10;example.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Anerh o pheugoen kai palin makesetai&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There is a tolerably good translation of it in Hudibras&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;For he that flies may fight again,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Which he can never do that&#39;s slain.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In a Blackwood article nothing makes so fine a show as your&#10;Greek. The very letters have an air of profundity about them. Only&#10;observe, madam, the astute look of that Epsilon! That Phi ought&#10;certainly to be a bishop! Was ever there a smarter fellow than that&#10;Omicron? Just twig that Tau! In short, there is nothing like Greek&#10;for a genuine sensation-paper. In the present case your application&#10;is the most obvious thing in the world. Rap out the sentence, with&#10;a huge oath, and by way of ultimatum at the good-for-nothing&#10;dunder-headed villain who couldn&#39;t understand your plain English in&#10;relation to the chicken-bone. He&#39;ll take the hint and be off, you&#10;may depend upon it.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;These were all the instructions Mr. B. could afford me upon the&#10;topic in question, but I felt they would be entirely sufficient. I&#10;was, at length, able to write a genuine Blackwood article, and&#10;determined to do it forthwith. In taking leave of me, Mr. B. made a&#10;proposition for the purchase of the paper when written; but as he&#10;could offer me only fifty guineas a sheet, I thought it better to&#10;let our society have it, than sacrifice it for so paltry a sum.&#10;Notwithstanding this niggardly spirit, however, the gentleman&#10;showed his consideration for me in all other respects, and indeed&#10;treated me with the greatest civility. His parting words made a&#10;deep impression upon my heart, and I hope I shall always remember&#10;them with gratitude.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My dear Miss Zenobia,&#34; he said, while the tears stood in his&#10;eyes, &#34;is there anything else I can do to promote the success of&#10;your laudable undertaking? Let me reflect! It is just possible that&#10;you may not be able, so soon as convenient, to&#8212;to&#8212;get yourself&#10;drowned, or&#8212;choked with a chicken-bone, or&#8212;or hung,&#8212;or&#8212;bitten by&#10;a&#8212;but stay! Now I think me of it, there are a couple of very&#10;excellent bull-dogs in the yard&#8212;fine fellows, I assure you&#8212;savage,&#10;and all that&#8212;indeed just the thing for your money&#8212;they&#39;ll have you&#10;eaten up, auricula and all, in less than five minutes (here&#39;s my&#10;watch!)&#8212;and then only think of the sensations! Here! I&#10;say&#8212;Tom!&#8212;Peter!&#8212;Dick, you villain!&#8212;let out those&#34;&#8212;but as I was&#10;really in a great hurry, and had not another moment to spare, I was&#10;reluctantly forced to expedite my departure, and accordingly took&#10;leave at once- somewhat more abruptly, I admit, than strict&#10;courtesy would have otherwise allowed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was my primary object upon quitting Mr. Blackwood, to get&#10;into some immediate difficulty, pursuant to his advice, and with&#10;this view I spent the greater part of the day in wandering about&#10;Edinburgh, seeking for desperate adventures&#8212;adventures adequate to&#10;the intensity of my feelings, and adapted to the vast character of&#10;the article I intended to write. In this excursion I was attended&#10;by one negro- servant, Pompey, and my little lap-dog Diana, whom I&#10;had brought with me from Philadelphia. It was not, however, until&#10;late in the afternoon that I fully succeeded in my arduous&#10;undertaking. An important event then happened of which the&#10;following Blackwood article, in the tone heterogeneous, is the&#10;substance and result.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 1, :source => 'feedbooks')

The confusion and bustle in the streets were&#10;terrible. Men were talking. Women were screaming. Children were&#10;choking. Pigs were whistling. Carts they rattled. Bulls they&#10;bellowed. Cows they lowed. Horses they neighed. Cats they&#10;caterwauled. Dogs they danced. Danced! Could it then be possible?&#10;Danced! Alas, thought I, my dancing days are over! Thus it is ever.&#10;What a host of gloomy recollections will ever and anon be awakened&#10;in the mind of genius and imaginative contemplation, especially of&#10;a genius doomed to the everlasting and eternal, and continual, and,&#10;as one might say, the- continued&#8212;yes, the continued and continuous,&#10;bitter, harassing, disturbing, and, if I may be allowed the&#10;expression, the very disturbing influence of the serene, and&#10;godlike, and heavenly, and exalted, and elevated, and purifying&#10;effect of what may be rightly termed the most enviable, the most&#10;truly enviable&#8212;nay! the most benignly beautiful, the most&#10;deliciously ethereal, and, as it were, the most pretty (if I may&#10;use so bold an expression) thing (pardon me, gentle reader!) in the&#10;world&#8212;but I am always led away by my feelings. In such a mind, I&#10;repeat, what a host of recollections are stirred up by a trifle!&#10;The dogs danced! I&#8212;I could not! They frisked&#8212;I wept. They capered&#8212;I&#10;sobbed aloud. Touching circumstances! which cannot fail to bring to&#10;the recollection of the classical reader that exquisite passage in&#10;relation to the fitness of things, which is to be found in the&#10;commencement of the third volume of that admirable and venerable&#10;Chinese novel the Jo-Go-Slow.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In my solitary walk through, the city I had two humble but&#10;faithful companions. Diana, my poodle! sweetest of creatures! She&#10;had a quantity of hair over her one eye, and a blue ribband tied&#10;fashionably around her neck. Diana was not more than five inches in&#10;height, but her head was somewhat bigger than her body, and her&#10;tail being cut off exceedingly close, gave an air of injured&#10;innocence to the interesting animal which rendered her a favorite&#10;with all.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And Pompey, my negro!&#8212;sweet Pompey! how shall I ever forget&#10;thee? I had taken Pompey&#39;s arm. He was three feet in height (I like&#10;to be particular) and about seventy, or perhaps eighty, years of&#10;age. He had bow-legs and was corpulent. His mouth should not be&#10;called small, nor his ears short. His teeth, however, were like&#10;pearl, and his large full eyes were deliciously white. Nature had&#10;endowed him with no neck, and had placed his ankles (as usual with&#10;that race) in the middle of the upper portion of the feet. He was&#10;clad with a striking simplicity. His sole garments were a stock of&#10;nine inches in height, and a nearly- new drab overcoat which had&#10;formerly been in the service of the tall, stately, and illustrious&#10;Dr. Moneypenny. It was a good overcoat. It was well cut. It was&#10;well made. The coat was nearly new. Pompey held it up out of the&#10;dirt with both hands.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There were three persons in our party, and two of them have&#10;already been the subject of remark. There was a third&#8212;that person&#10;was myself. I am the Signora Psyche Zenobia. I am not Suky Snobbs.&#10;My appearance is commanding. On the memorable occasion of which I&#10;speak I was habited in a crimson satin dress, with a sky-blue&#10;Arabian mantelet. And the dress had trimmings of green agraffas,&#10;and seven graceful flounces of the orange-colored auricula. I thus&#10;formed the third of the party. There was the poodle. There was&#10;Pompey. There was myself. We were three. Thus it is said there were&#10;originally but three Furies&#8212;Melty, Nimmy, and Hetty&#8212;Meditation,&#10;Memory, and Fiddling.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Leaning upon the arm of the gallant Pompey, and attended at a&#10;respectable distance by Diana, I proceeded down one of the populous&#10;and very pleasant streets of the now deserted Edina. On a sudden,&#10;there presented itself to view a church&#8212;a Gothic cathedral&#8212;vast,&#10;venerable, and with a tall steeple, which towered into the sky.&#10;What madness now possessed me? Why did I rush upon my fate? I was&#10;seized with an uncontrollable desire to ascend the giddy pinnacle,&#10;and then survey the immense extent of the city. The door of the&#10;cathedral stood invitingly open. My destiny prevailed. I entered&#10;the ominous archway. Where then was my guardian angel?&#8212;if indeed&#10;such angels there be. If! Distressing monosyllable! what world of&#10;mystery, and meaning, and doubt, and uncertainty is there involved&#10;in thy two letters! I entered the ominous archway! I entered; and,&#10;without injury to my orange-colored auriculas, I passed beneath the&#10;portal, and emerged within the vestibule. Thus it is said the&#10;immense river Alfred passed, unscathed, and unwetted, beneath the&#10;sea.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I thought the staircase would never have an end. Round! Yes,&#10;they went round and up, and round and up and round and up, until I&#10;could not help surmising, with the sagacious Pompey, upon whose&#10;supporting arm I leaned in all the confidence of early affection&#8212;I&#10;could not help surmising that the upper end of the continuous&#10;spiral ladder had been accidentally, or perhaps designedly,&#10;removed. I paused for breath; and, in the meantime, an accident&#10;occurred of too momentous a nature in a moral, and also in a&#10;metaphysical point of view, to be passed over without notice. It&#10;appeared to me&#8212;indeed I was quite confident of the fact&#8212;I could not&#10;be mistaken&#8212;no! I had, for some moments, carefully and anxiously&#10;observed the motions of my Diana&#8212;I say that I could not be&#10;mistaken&#8212;Diana smelt a rat! At once I called Pompey&#39;s attention to&#10;the subject, and he&#8212;he agreed with me. There was then no longer any&#10;reasonable room for doubt. The rat had been smelled&#8212;and by Diana.&#10;Heavens! shall I ever forget the intense excitement of the moment?&#10;Alas! what is the boasted intellect of man? The rat!&#8212;it was&#10;there&#8212;that is to say, it was somewhere. Diana smelled the rat. I&#8212;I&#10;could not! Thus it is said the Prussian Isis has, for some persons,&#10;a sweet and very powerful perfume, while to others it is perfectly&#10;scentless.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The staircase had been surmounted, and there were now only three&#10;or four more upward steps intervening between us and the summit. We&#10;still ascended, and now only one step remained. One step! One&#10;little, little step! Upon one such little step in the great&#10;staircase of human life how vast a sum of human happiness or misery&#10;depends! I thought of myself, then of Pompey, and then of the&#10;mysterious and inexplicable destiny which surrounded us. I thought&#10;of Pompey!&#8212;alas, I thought of love! I thought of my many false&#10;steps which have been taken, and may be taken again. I resolved to&#10;be more cautious, more reserved. I abandoned the arm of Pompey,&#10;and, without his assistance, surmounted the one remaining step, and&#10;gained the chamber of the belfry. I was followed immediately&#10;afterward by my poodle. Pompey alone remained behind. I stood at&#10;the head of the staircase, and encouraged him to ascend. He&#10;stretched forth to me his hand, and unfortunately in so doing was&#10;forced to abandon his firm hold upon the overcoat. Will the gods&#10;never cease their persecution? The overcoat is dropped, and, with&#10;one of his feet, Pompey stepped upon the long and trailing skirt of&#10;the overcoat. He stumbled and fell&#8212;this consequence was inevitable.&#10;He fell forward, and, with his accursed head, striking me full in&#10;the&#8212;in the breast, precipitated me headlong, together with himself,&#10;upon the hard, filthy, and detestable floor of the belfry. But my&#10;revenge was sure, sudden, and complete. Seizing him furiously by&#10;the wool with both hands, I tore out a vast quantity of black, and&#10;crisp, and curling material, and tossed it from me with every&#10;manifestation of disdain. It fell among the ropes of the belfry and&#10;remained. Pompey arose, and said no word. But he regarded me&#10;piteously with his large eyes and&#8212;sighed. Ye Gods&#8212;that sigh! It&#10;sunk into my heart. And the hair&#8212;the wool! Could I have reached&#10;that wool I would have bathed it with my tears, in testimony of&#10;regret. But alas! it was now far beyond my grasp. As it dangled&#10;among the cordage of the bell, I fancied it alive. I fancied that&#10;it stood on end with indignation. Thus the happy-dandy Flos Aeris&#10;of Java bears, it is said, a beautiful flower, which will live when&#10;pulled up by the roots. The natives suspend it by a cord from the&#10;ceiling and enjoy its fragrance for years.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Our quarrel was now made up, and we looked about the room for an&#10;aperture through which to survey the city of Edina. Windows there&#10;were none. The sole light admitted into the gloomy chamber&#10;proceeded from a square opening, about a foot in diameter, at a&#10;height of about seven feet from the floor. Yet what will the energy&#10;of true genius not effect? I resolved to clamber up to this hole. A&#10;vast quantity of wheels, pinions, and other cabalistic&#8212;looking&#10;machinery stood opposite the hole, close to it; and through the&#10;hole there passed an iron rod from the machinery. Between the&#10;wheels and the wall where the hole lay there was barely room for my&#10;body&#8212;yet I was desperate, and determined to persevere. I called&#10;Pompey to my side.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You perceive that aperture, Pompey. I wish to look through it.&#10;You will stand here just beneath the hole&#8212;so. Now, hold out one of&#10;your hands, Pompey, and let me step upon it&#8212;thus. Now, the other&#10;hand, Pompey, and with its aid I will get upon your shoulders.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He did every thing I wished, and I found, upon getting up, that&#10;I could easily pass my head and neck through the aperture. The&#10;prospect was sublime. Nothing could be more magnificent. I merely&#10;paused a moment to bid Diana behave herself, and assure Pompey that&#10;I would be considerate and bear as lightly as possible upon his&#10;shoulders. I told him I would be tender of his feelings&#8212;ossi tender&#10;que beefsteak. Having done this justice to my faithful friend, I&#10;gave myself up with great zest and enthusiasm to the enjoyment of&#10;the scene which so obligingly spread itself out before my eyes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Upon this subject, however, I shall forbear to dilate. I will&#10;not describe the city of Edinburgh. Every one has been to the city&#10;of Edinburgh. Every one has been to Edinburgh&#8212;the classic Edina. I&#10;will confine myself to the momentous details of my own lamentable&#10;adventure. Having, in some measure, satisfied my curiosity in&#10;regard to the extent, situation, and general appearance of the&#10;city, I had leisure to survey the church in which I was, and the&#10;delicate architecture of the steeple. I observed that the aperture&#10;through which I had thrust my head was an opening in the dial-plate&#10;of a gigantic clock, and must have appeared, from the street, as a&#10;large key-hole, such as we see in the face of the French watches.&#10;No doubt the true object was to admit the arm of an attendant, to&#10;adjust, when necessary, the hands of the clock from within. I&#10;observed also, with surprise, the immense size of these hands, the&#10;longest of which could not have been less than ten feet in length,&#10;and, where broadest, eight or nine inches in breadth. They were of&#10;solid steel apparently, and their edges appeared to be sharp.&#10;Having noticed these particulars, and some others, I again turned&#10;my eyes upon the glorious prospect below, and soon became absorbed&#10;in contemplation.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;From this, after some minutes, I was aroused by the voice of&#10;Pompey, who declared that he could stand it no longer, and&#10;requested that I would be so kind as to come down. This was&#10;unreasonable, and I told him so in a speech of some length. He&#10;replied, but with an evident misunderstanding of my ideas upon the&#10;subject. I accordingly grew angry, and told him in plain words,&#10;that he was a fool, that he had committed an ignoramus&#10;e-clench-eye, that his notions were mere insommary Bovis, and his&#10;words little better than an ennemywerrybor&#39;em. With this he&#10;appeared satisfied, and I resumed my contemplations.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It might have been half an hour after this altercation when, as&#10;I was deeply absorbed in the heavenly scenery beneath me, I was&#10;startled by something very cold which pressed with a gentle&#10;pressure on the back of my neck. It is needless to say that I felt&#10;inexpressibly alarmed. I knew that Pompey was beneath my feet, and&#10;that Diana was sitting, according to my explicit directions, upon&#10;her hind legs, in the farthest corner of the room. What could it&#10;be? Alas! I but too soon discovered. Turning my head gently to one&#10;side, I perceived, to my extreme horror, that the huge, glittering,&#10;scimetar-like minute-hand of the clock had, in the course of its&#10;hourly revolution, descended upon my neck. There was, I knew, not a&#10;second to be lost. I pulled back at once&#8212;but it was too late. There&#10;was no chance of forcing my head through the mouth of that terrible&#10;trap in which it was so fairly caught, and which grew narrower and&#10;narrower with a rapidity too horrible to be conceived. The agony of&#10;that moment is not to be imagined. I threw up my hands and&#10;endeavored, with all my strength, to force upward the ponderous&#10;iron bar. I might as well have tried to lift the cathedral itself.&#10;Down, down, down it came, closer and yet closer. I screamed to&#10;Pompey for aid; but he said that I had hurt his feelings by calling&#10;him &#39;an ignorant old squint-eye:&#39; I yelled to Diana; but she only&#10;said &#39;bow-wow-wow,&#39; and that I had told her &#39;on no account to stir&#10;from the corner.&#39; Thus I had no relief to expect from my&#10;associates.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Meantime the ponderous and terrific Scythe of Time (for I now&#10;discovered the literal import of that classical phrase) had not&#10;stopped, nor was it likely to stop, in its career. Down and still&#10;down, it came. It had already buried its sharp edge a full inch in&#10;my flesh, and my sensations grew indistinct and confused. At one&#10;time I fancied myself in Philadelphia with the stately Dr.&#10;Moneypenny, at another in the back parlor of Mr. Blackwood&#10;receiving his invaluable instructions. And then again the sweet&#10;recollection of better and earlier times came over me, and I&#10;thought of that happy period when the world was not all a desert,&#10;and Pompey not altogether cruel.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The ticking of the machinery amused me. Amused me, I say, for my&#10;sensations now bordered upon perfect happiness, and the most&#10;trifling circumstances afforded me pleasure. The eternal&#10;click-clak, click-clak, click-clak of the clock was the most&#10;melodious of music in my ears, and occasionally even put me in mind&#10;of the graceful sermonic harangues of Dr. Ollapod. Then there were&#10;the great figures upon the dial-plate&#8212;how intelligent how&#10;intellectual, they all looked! And presently they took to dancing&#10;the Mazurka, and I think it was the figure V. who performed the&#10;most to my satisfaction. She was evidently a lady of breeding. None&#10;of your swaggerers, and nothing at all indelicate in her motions.&#10;She did the pirouette to admiration- whirling round upon her apex.&#10;I made an endeavor to hand her a chair, for I saw that she appeared&#10;fatigued with her exertions&#8212;and it was not until then that I fully&#10;perceived my lamentable situation. Lamentable indeed! The bar had&#10;buried itself two inches in my neck. I was aroused to a sense of&#10;exquisite pain. I prayed for death, and, in the agony of the&#10;moment, could not help repeating those exquisite verses of the poet&#10;Miguel De Cervantes:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Vanny Buren, tan escondida&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Query no te senty venny&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Pork and pleasure, delly morry&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Nommy, torny, darry, widdy!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But now a new horror presented itself, and one indeed sufficient&#10;to startle the strongest nerves. My eyes, from the cruel pressure&#10;of the machine, were absolutely starting from their sockets. While&#10;I was thinking how I should possibly manage without them, one&#10;actually tumbled out of my head, and, rolling down the steep side&#10;of the steeple, lodged in the rain gutter which ran along the eaves&#10;of the main building. The loss of the eye was not so much as the&#10;insolent air of independence and contempt with which it regarded me&#10;after it was out. There it lay in the gutter just under my nose,&#10;and the airs it gave itself would have been ridiculous had they not&#10;been disgusting. Such a winking and blinking were never before&#10;seen. This behavior on the part of my eye in the gutter was not&#10;only irritating on account of its manifest insolence and shameful&#10;ingratitude, but was also exceedingly inconvenient on account of&#10;the sympathy which always exists between two eyes of the same head,&#10;however far apart. I was forced, in a manner, to wink and to blink,&#10;whether I would or not, in exact concert with the scoundrelly thing&#10;that lay just under my nose. I was presently relieved, however, by&#10;the dropping out of the other eye. In falling it took the same&#10;direction (possibly a concerted plot) as its fellow. Both rolled&#10;out of the gutter together, and in truth I was very glad to get rid&#10;of them.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The bar was now four inches and a half deep in my neck, and&#10;there was only a little bit of skin to cut through. My sensations&#10;were those of entire happiness, for I felt that in a few minutes,&#10;at farthest, I should be relieved from my disagreeable situation.&#10;And in this expectation I was not at all deceived. At twenty-five&#10;minutes past five in the afternoon, precisely, the huge minute-hand&#10;had proceeded sufficiently far on its terrible revolution to sever&#10;the small remainder of my neck. I was not sorry to see the head&#10;which had occasioned me so much embarrassment at length make a&#10;final separation from my body. It first rolled down the side of the&#10;steeple, then lodge, for a few seconds, in the gutter, and then&#10;made its way, with a plunge, into the middle of the street.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I will candidly confess that my feelings were now of the most&#10;singular&#8212;nay, of the most mysterious, the most perplexing and&#10;incomprehensible character. My senses were here and there at one&#10;and the same moment. With my head I imagined, at one time, that I,&#10;the head, was the real Signora Psyche Zenobia&#8212;at another I felt&#10;convinced that myself, the body, was the proper identity. To clear&#10;my ideas on this topic I felt in my pocket for my snuff-box, but,&#10;upon getting it, and endeavoring to apply a pinch of its grateful&#10;contents in the ordinary manner, I became immediately aware of my&#10;peculiar deficiency, and threw the box at once down to my head. It&#10;took a pinch with great satisfaction, and smiled me an&#10;acknowledgement in return. Shortly afterward it made me a speech,&#10;which I could hear but indistinctly without ears. I gathered&#10;enough, however, to know that it was astonished at my wishing to&#10;remain alive under such circumstances. In the concluding sentences&#10;it quoted the noble words of Ariosto&#8212;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Il pover hommy che non sera corty&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And have a combat tenty erry morty;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;thus comparing me to the hero who, in the heat of the combat,&#10;not perceiving that he was dead, continued to contest the battle&#10;with inextinguishable valor. There was nothing now to prevent my&#10;getting down from my elevation, and I did so. What it was that&#10;Pompey saw so very peculiar in my appearance I have never yet been&#10;able to find out. The fellow opened his mouth from ear to ear, and&#10;shut his two eyes as if he were endeavoring to crack nuts between&#10;the lids. Finally, throwing off his overcoat, he made one spring&#10;for the staircase and disappeared. I hurled after the scoundrel&#10;these vehement words of Demosthenes&#8212;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Andrew O&#39;Phlegethon, you really make haste to fly,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;and then turned to the darling of my heart, to the one-eyed! the&#10;shaggy-haired Diana. Alas! what a horrible vision affronted my&#10;eyes? Was that a rat I saw skulking into his hole? Are these the&#10;picked bones of the little angel who has been cruelly devoured by&#10;the monster? Ye gods! and what do I behold&#8212;is that the departed&#10;spirit, the shade, the ghost, of my beloved puppy, which I perceive&#10;sitting with a grace so melancholy, in the corner? Hearken! for she&#10;speaks, and, heavens! it is in the German of Schiller&#8212;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Unt stubby duk, so stubby dun&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Duk she! duk she!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Alas! and are not her words too true?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And if I died, at least I died&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For thee&#8212;for thee.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Sweet creature! she too has sacrificed herself in my behalf.&#10;Dogless, niggerless, headless, what now remains for the unhappy&#10;Signora Psyche Zenobia? Alas&#8211;nothing! I have done.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 1, :source => 'feedbooks')

This honor is, however, more properly&#10;attributable to Cambyses, the son of Cyrus. And, indeed, the&#10;character of the Syrian monarch does by no means stand in need of&#10;any adventitious embellishment. His accession to the throne, or&#10;rather his usurpation of the sovereignty, a hundred and seventy-one&#10;years before the coming of Christ; his attempt to plunder the&#10;temple of Diana at Ephesus; his implacable hostility to the Jews;&#10;his pollution of the Holy of Holies; and his miserable death at&#10;Taba, after a tumultuous reign of eleven years, are circumstances&#10;of a prominent kind, and therefore more generally noticed by the&#10;historians of his time than the impious, dastardly, cruel, silly,&#10;and whimsical achievements which make up the sum total of his&#10;private life and reputation.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Let us suppose, gentle reader, that it is now the year of the&#10;world three thousand eight hundred and thirty, and let us, for a&#10;few minutes, imagine ourselves at that most grotesque habitation of&#10;man, the remarkable city of Antioch. To be sure there were, in&#10;Syria and other countries, sixteen cities of that appellation,&#10;besides the one to which I more particularly allude. But ours is&#10;that which went by the name of Antiochia Epidaphne, from its&#10;vicinity to the little village of Daphne, where stood a temple to&#10;that divinity. It was built (although about this matter there is&#10;some dispute) by Seleucus Nicanor, the first king of the country&#10;after Alexander the Great, in memory of his father Antiochus, and&#10;became immediately the residence of the Syrian monarchy. In the&#10;flourishing times of the Roman Empire, it was the ordinary station&#10;of the prefect of the eastern provinces; and many of the emperors&#10;of the queen city (among whom may be mentioned, especially, Verus&#10;and Valens) spent here the greater part of their time. But I&#10;perceive we have arrived at the city itself. Let us ascend this&#10;battlement, and throw our eyes upon the town and neighboring&#10;country.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What broad and rapid river is that which forces its way, with&#10;innumerable falls, through the mountainous wilderness, and finally&#10;through the wilderness of buildings?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;That is the Orontes, and it is the only water in sight, with the&#10;exception of the Mediterranean, which stretches, like a broad&#10;mirror, about twelve miles off to the southward. Every one has seen&#10;the Mediterranean; but let me tell you, there are few who have had&#10;a peep at Antioch. By few, I mean, few who, like you and me, have&#10;had, at the same time, the advantages of a modern education.&#10;Therefore cease to regard that sea, and give your whole attention&#10;to the mass of houses that lie beneath us. You will remember that&#10;it is now the year of the world three thousand eight hundred and&#10;thirty. Were it later&#8212;for example, were it the year of our Lord&#10;eighteen hundred and forty-five, we should be deprived of this&#10;extraordinary spectacle. In the nineteenth century Antioch is&#8212;that&#10;is to say, Antioch will be&#8212;in a lamentable state of decay. It will&#10;have been, by that time, totally destroyed, at three different&#10;periods, by three successive earthquakes. Indeed, to say the truth,&#10;what little of its former self may then remain, will be found in so&#10;desolate and ruinous a state that the patriarch shall have removed&#10;his residence to Damascus. This is well. I see you profit by my&#10;advice, and are making the most of your time in inspecting the&#10;premises&#8212;in&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8212;satisfying your eyes&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With the memorials and the things of fame&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;That most renown this city.&#8212;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I beg pardon; I had forgotten that Shakespeare will not flourish&#10;for seventeen hundred and fifty years to come. But does not the&#10;appearance of Epidaphne justify me in calling it grotesque?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It is well fortified; and in this respect is as much indebted&#10;to nature as to art.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Very true.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;There are a prodigious number of stately palaces.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There are.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And the numerous temples, sumptuous and magnificent, may bear&#10;comparison with the most lauded of antiquity.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;All this I must acknowledge. Still there is an infinity of mud&#10;huts, and abominable hovels. We cannot help perceiving abundance of&#10;filth in every kennel, and, were it not for the over-powering fumes&#10;of idolatrous incense, I have no doubt we should find a most&#10;intolerable stench. Did you ever behold streets so insufferably&#10;narrow, or houses so miraculously tall? What gloom their shadows&#10;cast upon the ground! It is well the swinging lamps in those&#10;endless colonnades are kept burning throughout the day; we should&#10;otherwise have the darkness of Egypt in the time of her&#10;desolation.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It is certainly a strange place! What is the meaning of yonder&#10;singular building? See! it towers above all others, and lies to the&#10;eastward of what I take to be the royal palace.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;That is the new Temple of the Sun, who is adored in Syria under&#10;the title of Elah Gabalah. Hereafter a very notorious Roman Emperor&#10;will institute this worship in Rome, and thence derive a cognomen,&#10;Heliogabalus. I dare say you would like to take a peep at the&#10;divinity of the temple. You need not look up at the heavens; his&#10;Sunship is not there&#8212;at least not the Sunship adored by the&#10;Syrians. That deity will be found in the interior of yonder&#10;building. He is worshipped under the figure of a large stone pillar&#10;terminating at the summit in a cone or pyramid, whereby is denoted&#10;Fire.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Hark&#8212;behold!&#8212;who can those ridiculous beings be, half naked,&#10;with their faces painted, shouting and gesticulating to the&#10;rabble?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Some few are mountebanks. Others more particularly belong to the&#10;race of philosophers. The greatest portion, however&#8212;those&#10;especially who belabor the populace with clubs&#8212;are the principal&#10;courtiers of the palace, executing as in duty bound, some laudable&#10;comicality of the king&#39;s.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But what have we here? Heavens! the town is swarming with wild&#10;beasts! How terrible a spectacle!&#8212;how dangerous a peculiarity!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Terrible, if you please; but not in the least degree dangerous.&#10;Each animal if you will take the pains to observe, is following,&#10;very quietly, in the wake of its master. Some few, to be sure, are&#10;led with a rope about the neck, but these are chiefly the lesser or&#10;timid species. The lion, the tiger, and the leopard are entirely&#10;without restraint. They have been trained without difficulty to&#10;their present profession, and attend upon their respective owners&#10;in the capacity of valets-de-chambre. It is true, there are&#10;occasions when Nature asserts her violated dominions;&#8212;but then the&#10;devouring of a man-at-arms, or the throttling of a consecrated&#10;bull, is a circumstance of too little moment to be more than hinted&#10;at in Epidaphne.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But what extraordinary tumult do I hear? Surely this is a loud&#10;noise even for Antioch! It argues some commotion of unusual&#10;interest.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Yes&#8212;undoubtedly. The king has ordered some novel spectacle&#8212;some&#10;gladiatorial exhibition at the hippodrome&#8212;or perhaps the massacre&#10;of the Scythian prisoners&#8212;or the conflagration of his new palace&#8212;or&#10;the tearing down of a handsome temple&#8212;or, indeed, a bonfire of a&#10;few Jews. The uproar increases. Shouts of laughter ascend the&#10;skies. The air becomes dissonant with wind instruments, and&#10;horrible with clamor of a million throats. Let us descend, for the&#10;love of fun, and see what is going on! This way&#8212;be careful! Here we&#10;are in the principal street, which is called the street of&#10;Timarchus. The sea of people is coming this way, and we shall find&#10;a difficulty in stemming the tide. They are pouring through the&#10;alley of Heraclides, which leads directly from the&#10;palace;&#8212;therefore the king is most probably among the rioters.&#10;Yes;&#8212;I hear the shouts of the herald proclaiming his approach in&#10;the pompous phraseology of the East. We shall have a glimpse of his&#10;person as he passes by the temple of Ashimah. Let us ensconce&#10;ourselves in the vestibule of the sanctuary; he will be here anon.&#10;In the meantime let us survey this image. What is it? Oh! it is the&#10;god Ashimah in proper person. You perceive, however, that he is&#10;neither a lamb, nor a goat, nor a satyr, neither has he much&#10;resemblance to the Pan of the Arcadians. Yet all these appearances&#10;have been given&#8212;I beg pardon&#8212;will be given&#8212;by the learned of future&#10;ages, to the Ashimah of the Syrians. Put on your spectacles, and&#10;tell me what it is. What is it?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Bless me! it is an ape!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;True&#8212;a baboon; but by no means the less a deity. His name is a&#10;derivation of the Greek Simia&#8212;what great fools are antiquarians!&#10;But see!&#8212;see!&#8212;yonder scampers a ragged little urchin. Where is he&#10;going? What is he bawling about? What does he say? Oh! he says the&#10;king is coming in triumph; that he is dressed in state; that he has&#10;just finished putting to death, with his own hand, a thousand&#10;chained Israelitish prisoners! For this exploit the ragamuffin is&#10;lauding him to the skies. Hark! here comes a troop of a similar&#10;description. They have made a Latin hymn upon the valor of the&#10;king, and are singing it as they go:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mille, mille, mille,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mille, mille, mille,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Decollavimus, unus homo!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mille, mille, mille, mille, decollavimus!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mille, mille, mille,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Vivat qui mille mille occidit!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tantum vini habet nemo&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Quantum sanguinis effudit!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Which may be thus paraphrased:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A thousand, a thousand, a thousand,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A thousand, a thousand, a thousand,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;We, with one warrior, have slain!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A thousand, a thousand, a thousand, a thousand.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Sing a thousand over again!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Soho!&#8212;let us sing&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Long life to our king,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Who knocked over a thousand so fine!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Soho!&#8212;let us roar,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He has given us more&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Red gallons of gore&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Than all Syria can furnish of wine!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Do you hear that flourish of trumpets?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Yes: the king is coming! See! the people are aghast with&#10;admiration, and lift up their eyes to the heavens in reverence. He&#10;comes;&#8212;he is coming;&#8212;there he is!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Who?&#8212;where?&#8212;the king?&#8212;do not behold him&#8212;cannot say that I&#10;perceive him.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then you must be blind.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Very possible. Still I see nothing but a tumultuous mob of&#10;idiots and madmen, who are busy in prostrating themselves before a&#10;gigantic cameleopard, and endeavoring to obtain a kiss of the&#10;animal&#39;s hoofs. See! the beast has very justly kicked one of the&#10;rabble over&#8212;and another&#8212;and another&#8212;and another. Indeed, I cannot&#10;help admiring the animal for the excellent use he is making of his&#10;feet.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Rabble, indeed!&#8212;why these are the noble and free citizens of&#10;Epidaphne! Beasts, did you say?&#8212;take care that you are not&#10;overheard. Do you not perceive that the animal has the visage of a&#10;man? Why, my dear sir, that cameleopard is no other than Antiochus&#10;Epiphanes, Antiochus the Illustrious, King of Syria, and the most&#10;potent of all the autocrats of the East! It is true, that he is&#10;entitled, at times, Antiochus Epimanes&#8212;Antiochus the madman&#8212;but&#10;that is because all people have not the capacity to appreciate his&#10;merits. It is also certain that he is at present ensconced in the&#10;hide of a beast, and is doing his best to play the part of a&#10;cameleopard; but this is done for the better sustaining his dignity&#10;as king. Besides, the monarch is of gigantic stature, and the dress&#10;is therefore neither unbecoming nor over large. We may, however,&#10;presume he would not have adopted it but for some occasion of&#10;especial state. Such, you will allow, is the massacre of a thousand&#10;Jews. With how superior a dignity the monarch perambulates on all&#10;fours! His tail, you perceive, is held aloft by his two principal&#10;concubines, Elline and Argelais; and his whole appearance would be&#10;infinitely prepossessing, were it not for the protuberance of his&#10;eyes, which will certainly start out of his head, and the queer&#10;color of his face, which has become nondescript from the quantity&#10;of wine he has swallowed. Let us follow him to the hippodrome,&#10;whither he is proceeding, and listen to the song of triumph which&#10;he is commencing:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Who is king but Epiphanes?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Say&#8212;do you know?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Who is king but Epiphanes?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Bravo!&#8212;bravo!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There is none but Epiphanes,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;No&#8212;there is none:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So tear down the temples,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And put out the sun!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Well and strenuously sung! The populace are hailing him &#39;Prince&#10;of Poets,&#39; as well as &#39;Glory of the East,&#39; &#39;Delight of the&#10;Universe,&#39; and &#39;Most Remarkable of Cameleopards.&#39; They have encored&#10;his effusion, and do you hear?&#8212;he is singing it over again. When he&#10;arrives at the hippodrome, he will be crowned with the poetic&#10;wreath, in anticipation of his victory at the approaching&#10;Olympics.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But, good Jupiter! what is the matter in the crowd behind&#10;us?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Behind us, did you say?&#8212;oh! ah!&#8212;I perceive. My friend, it is&#10;well that you spoke in time. Let us get into a place of safety as&#10;soon as possible. Here!&#8212;let us conceal ourselves in the arch of&#10;this aqueduct, and I will inform you presently of the origin of the&#10;commotion. It has turned out as I have been anticipating. The&#10;singular appearance of the cameleopard and the head of a man, has,&#10;it seems, given offence to the notions of propriety entertained, in&#10;general, by the wild animals domesticated in the city. A mutiny has&#10;been the result; and, as is usual upon such occasions, all human&#10;efforts will be of no avail in quelling the mob. Several of the&#10;Syrians have already been devoured; but the general voice of the&#10;four-footed patriots seems to be for eating up the cameleopard.&#10;&#39;The Prince of Poets,&#39; therefore, is upon his hinder legs, running&#10;for his life. His courtiers have left him in the lurch, and his&#10;concubines have followed so excellent an example. &#39;Delight of the&#10;Universe,&#39; thou art in a sad predicament! &#39;Glory of the East,&#39; thou&#10;art in danger of mastication! Therefore never regard so piteously&#10;thy tail; it will undoubtedly be draggled in the mud, and for this&#10;there is no help. Look not behind thee, then, at its unavoidable&#10;degradation; but take courage, ply thy legs with vigor, and scud&#10;for the hippodrome! Remember that thou art Antiochus Epiphanes.&#10;Antiochus the Illustrious!&#8212;also &#39;Prince of Poets,&#39; &#39;Glory of the&#10;East,&#39; &#39;Delight of the Universe,&#39; and &#39;Most Remarkable of&#10;Cameleopards!&#39; Heavens! what a power of speed thou art displaying!&#10;What a capacity for leg-bail thou art developing! Run,&#10;Prince!&#8212;Bravo, Epiphanes! Well done, Cameleopard!&#8212;Glorious&#10;Antiochus!&#8212;He runs!&#8212;he leaps!&#8212;he flies! Like an arrow from a&#10;catapult he approaches the hippodrome! He leaps!&#8212;he shrieks!&#8212;he is&#10;there! This is well; for hadst thou, &#39;Glory of the East,&#39; been half&#10;a second longer in reaching the gates of the Amphitheatre, there is&#10;not a bear&#39;s cub in Epidaphne that would not have had a nibble at&#10;thy carcase. Let us be off&#8212;let us take our departure!&#8212;for we shall&#10;find our delicate modern ears unable to endure the vast uproar&#10;which is about to commence in celebration of the king&#39;s escape!&#10;Listen! it has already commenced. See!&#8212;the whole town is&#10;topsy-turvy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Surely this is the most populous city of the East! What a&#10;wilderness of people! what a jumble of all ranks and ages! what a&#10;multiplicity of sects and nations! what a variety of costumes! what&#10;a Babel of languages! what a screaming of beasts! what a tinkling&#10;of instruments! what a parcel of philosophers!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Come let us be off.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Stay a moment! I see a vast hubbub in the hippodrome; what is&#10;the meaning of it, I beseech you?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;That?&#8212;oh, nothing! The noble and free citizens of Epidaphne&#10;being, as they declare, well satisfied of the faith, valor, wisdom,&#10;and divinity of their king, and having, moreover, been&#10;eye-witnesses of his late superhuman agility, do think it no more&#10;than their duty to invest his brows (in addition to the poetic&#10;crown) with the wreath of victory in the footrace&#8212;a wreath which it&#10;is evident he must obtain at the celebration of the next Olympiad,&#10;and which, therefore, they now give him in advance.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 1, :source => 'feedbooks')

(60 (10),646.)&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The mountain pinnacles slumber; valleys, crags and caves are&#10;silent.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Listen to me,&#34; said the Demon as he placed his hand upon my&#10;head. &#34;The region of which I speak is a dreary region in Libya, by&#10;the borders of the river Zaire. And there is no quiet there, nor&#10;silence.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The waters of the river have a saffron and sickly hue; and they&#10;flow not onwards to the sea, but palpitate forever and forever&#10;beneath the red eye of the sun with a tumultuous and convulsive&#10;motion. For many miles on either side of the river&#39;s oozy bed is a&#10;pale desert of gigantic water-lilies. They sigh one unto the other&#10;in that solitude, and stretch towards the heaven their long and&#10;ghastly necks, and nod to and fro their everlasting heads. And&#10;there is an indistinct murmur which cometh out from among them like&#10;the rushing of subterrene water. And they sigh one unto the&#10;other.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But there is a boundary to their realm&#8212;the boundary of the&#10;dark, horrible, lofty forest. There, like the waves about the&#10;Hebrides, the low underwood is agitated continually. But there is&#10;no wind throughout the heaven. And the tall primeval trees rock&#10;eternally hither and thither with a crashing and mighty sound. And&#10;from their high summits, one by one, drop everlasting dews. And at&#10;the roots strange poisonous flowers lie writhing in perturbed&#10;slumber. And overhead, with a rustling and loud noise, the gray&#10;clouds rush westwardly forever, until they roll, a cataract, over&#10;the fiery wall of the horizon. But there is no wind throughout the&#10;heaven. And by the shores of the river Zaire there is neither quiet&#10;nor silence.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It was night, and the rain fell; and falling, it was rain, but,&#10;having fallen, it was blood. And I stood in the morass among the&#10;tall and the rain fell upon my head &#8212;and the lilies sighed one unto&#10;the other in the solemnity of their desolation.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And, all at once, the moon arose through the thin ghastly mist,&#10;and was crimson in color. And mine eyes fell upon a huge gray rock&#10;which stood by the shore of the river, and was lighted by the light&#10;of the moon. And the rock was gray, and ghastly, and tall,&#8212;and the&#10;rock was gray. Upon its front were characters engraven in the&#10;stone; and I walked through the morass of water-lilies, until I&#10;came close unto the shore, that I might read the characters upon&#10;the stone. But I could not decypher them. And I was going back into&#10;the morass, when the moon shone with a fuller red, and I turned and&#10;looked again upon the rock, and upon the characters;&#8212;and the&#10;characters were DESOLATION.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And I looked upwards, and there stood a man upon the summit of&#10;the rock; and I hid myself among the water-lilies that I might&#10;discover the actions of the man. And the man was tall and stately&#10;in form, and was wrapped up from his shoulders to his feet in the&#10;toga of old Rome. And the outlines of his figure were&#10;indistinct&#8212;but his features were the features of a deity; for the&#10;mantle of the night, and of the mist, and of the moon, and of the&#10;dew, had left uncovered the features of his face. And his brow was&#10;lofty with thought, and his eye wild with care; and, in the few&#10;furrows upon his cheek I read the fables of sorrow, and weariness,&#10;and disgust with mankind, and a longing after solitude.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And the man sat upon the rock, and leaned his head upon his&#10;hand, and looked out upon the desolation. He looked down into the&#10;low unquiet shrubbery, and up into the tall primeval trees, and up&#10;higher at the rustling heaven, and into the crimson moon. And I lay&#10;close within shelter of the lilies, and observed the actions of the&#10;man. And the man trembled in the solitude; &#8212;but the night waned,&#10;and he sat upon the rock.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And the man turned his attention from the heaven, and looked&#10;out upon the dreary river Zaire, and upon the yellow ghastly&#10;waters, and upon the pale legions of the water-lilies. And the man&#10;listened to the sighs of the water-lilies, and to the murmur that&#10;came up from among them. And I lay close within my covert and&#10;observed the actions of the man. And the man trembled in the&#10;solitude; &#8212;but the night waned and he sat upon the rock.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Then I went down into the recesses of the morass, and waded&#10;afar in among the wilderness of the lilies, and called unto the&#10;hippopotami which dwelt among the fens in the recesses of the&#10;morass. And the hippopotami heard my call, and came, with the&#10;behemoth, unto the foot of the rock, and roared loudly and&#10;fearfully beneath the moon. And I lay close within my covert and&#10;observed the actions of the man. And the man trembled in the&#10;solitude; &#8212;but the night waned and he sat upon the rock.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Then I cursed the elements with the curse of tumult; and a&#10;frightful tempest gathered in the heaven where, before, there had&#10;been no wind. And the heaven became livid with the violence of the&#10;tempest &#8212;and the rain beat upon the head of the man &#8212;and the floods&#10;of the river came down &#8212;and the river was tormented into foam &#8212;and&#10;the water-lilies shrieked within their beds &#8212;and the forest&#10;crumbled before the wind &#8212;and the thunder rolled &#8212;and the lightning&#10;fell &#8212;and the rock rocked to its foundation. And I lay close within&#10;my covert and observed the actions of the man. And the man trembled&#10;in the solitude; &#8212;but the night waned and he sat upon the rock.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Then I grew angry and cursed, with the curse of silence, the&#10;river, and the lilies, and the wind, and the forest, and the&#10;heaven, and the thunder, and the sighs of the water-lilies. And&#10;they became accursed, and were still. And the moon ceased to totter&#10;up its pathway to heaven &#8212;and the thunder died away &#8212;and the&#10;lightning did not flash &#8212;and the clouds hung motionless &#8212;and the&#10;waters sunk to their level and remained &#8212;and the trees ceased to&#10;rock &#8212;and the water-lilies sighed no more &#8212;and the murmur was heard&#10;no longer from among them, nor any shadow of sound throughout the&#10;vast illimitable desert. And I looked upon the characters of the&#10;rock, and they were changed; &#8212;and the characters were SILENCE.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And mine eyes fell upon the countenance of the man, and his&#10;countenance was wan with terror. And, hurriedly, he raised his head&#10;from his hand, and stood forth upon the rock and listened. But&#10;there was no voice throughout the vast illimitable desert, and the&#10;characters upon the rock were SILENCE. And the man shuddered, and&#10;turned his face away, and fled afar off, in haste, so that I beheld&#10;him no more.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now there are fine tales in the volumes of the Magi &#8212;in the&#10;iron-bound, melancholy volumes of the Magi. Therein, I say, are&#10;glorious histories of the Heaven, and of the Earth, and of the&#10;mighty sea &#8212;and of the Genii that over-ruled the sea, and the&#10;earth, and the lofty heaven. There was much lore too in the sayings&#10;which were said by the Sybils; and holy, holy things were heard of&#10;old by the dim leaves that trembled around Dodona &#8212;but, as Allah&#10;liveth, that fable which the Demon told me as he sat by my side in&#10;the shadow of the tomb, I hold to be the most wonderful of all! And&#10;as the Demon made an end of his story, he fell back within the&#10;cavity of the tomb and laughed. And I could not laugh with the&#10;Demon, and he cursed me because I could not laugh. And the lynx&#10;which dwelleth forever in the tomb, came out therefrom, and lay&#10;down at the feet of the Demon, and looked at him steadily in the&#10;face.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 1, :source => 'feedbooks')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('The Unparalleled Adventure of One Hans&#10;Pfaall'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;By late accounts from Rotterdam, that city seems to be in a high&#10;state of philosophical excitement. Indeed, phenomena have there&#10;occurred of a nature so completely unexpected&#8212;so entirely novel&#8212;so&#10;utterly at variance with preconceived opinions&#8212;as to leave no doubt&#10;on my mind that long ere this all Europe is in an uproar, all&#10;physics in a ferment, all reason and astronomy together by the&#10;ears.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It appears that on the &#8212; &#8212; day of &#8212; &#8212; (I am not positive about&#10;the date), a vast crowd of people, for purposes not specifically&#10;mentioned, were assembled in the great square of the Exchange in&#10;the well-conditioned city of Rotterdam. The day was warm&#8212;unusually&#10;so for the season&#8212;there was hardly a breath of air stirring; and&#10;the multitude were in no bad humor at being now and then&#10;besprinkled with friendly showers of momentary duration, that fell&#10;from large white masses of cloud which chequered in a fitful manner&#10;the blue vault of the firmament. Nevertheless, about noon, a slight&#10;but remarkable agitation became apparent in the assembly: the&#10;clattering of ten thousand tongues succeeded; and, in an instant&#10;afterward, ten thousand faces were upturned toward the heavens, ten&#10;thousand pipes descended simultaneously from the corners of ten&#10;thousand mouths, and a shout, which could be compared to nothing&#10;but the roaring of Niagara, resounded long, loudly, and furiously,&#10;through all the environs of Rotterdam.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The origin of this hubbub soon became sufficiently evident. From&#10;behind the huge bulk of one of those sharply-defined masses of&#10;cloud already mentioned, was seen slowly to emerge into an open&#10;area of blue space, a queer, heterogeneous, but apparently solid&#10;substance, so oddly shaped, so whimsically put together, as not to&#10;be in any manner comprehended, and never to be sufficiently&#10;admired, by the host of sturdy burghers who stood open-mouthed&#10;below. What could it be? In the name of all the vrows and devils in&#10;Rotterdam, what could it possibly portend? No one knew, no one&#10;could imagine; no one&#8212;not even the burgomaster Mynheer Superbus Von&#10;Underduk&#8212;had the slightest clew by which to unravel the mystery;&#10;so, as nothing more reasonable could be done, every one to a man&#10;replaced his pipe carefully in the corner of his mouth, and cocking&#10;up his right eye towards the phenomenon, puffed, paused, waddled&#10;about, and grunted significantly&#8212;then waddled back, grunted,&#10;paused, and finally&#8212;puffed again.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In the meantime, however, lower and still lower toward the&#10;goodly city, came the object of so much curiosity, and the cause of&#10;so much smoke. In a very few minutes it arrived near enough to be&#10;accurately discerned. It appeared to be&#8212;yes! it was undoubtedly a&#10;species of balloon; but surely no such balloon had ever been seen&#10;in Rotterdam before. For who, let me ask, ever heard of a balloon&#10;manufactured entirely of dirty newspapers? No man in Holland&#10;certainly; yet here, under the very noses of the people, or rather&#10;at some distance above their noses was the identical thing in&#10;question, and composed, I have it on the best authority, of the&#10;precise material which no one had ever before known to be used for&#10;a similar purpose. It was an egregious insult to the good sense of&#10;the burghers of Rotterdam. As to the shape of the phenomenon, it&#10;was even still more reprehensible. Being little or nothing better&#10;than a huge foolscap turned upside down. And this similitude was&#10;regarded as by no means lessened when, upon nearer inspection,&#10;there was perceived a large tassel depending from its apex, and,&#10;around the upper rim or base of the cone, a circle of little&#10;instruments, resembling sheep-bells, which kept up a continual&#10;tinkling to the tune of Betty Martin. But still worse. Suspended by&#10;blue ribbons to the end of this fantastic machine, there hung, by&#10;way of car, an enormous drab beaver bat, with a brim superlatively&#10;broad, and a hemispherical crown with a black band and a silver&#10;buckle. It is, however, somewhat remarkable that many citizens of&#10;Rotterdam swore to having seen the same hat repeatedly before; and&#10;indeed the whole assembly seemed to regard it with eyes of&#10;familiarity; while the vrow Grettel Pfaall, upon sight of it,&#10;uttered an exclamation of joyful surprise, and declared it to be&#10;the identical hat of her good man himself. Now this was a&#10;circumstance the more to be observed, as Pfaall, with three&#10;companions, had actually disappeared from Rotterdam about five&#10;years before, in a very sudden and unaccountable manner, and up to&#10;the date of this narrative all attempts had failed of obtaining any&#10;intelligence concerning them whatsoever. To be sure, some bones&#10;which were thought to be human, mixed up with a quantity of&#10;odd-looking rubbish, had been lately discovered in a retired&#10;situation to the east of Rotterdam, and some people went so far as&#10;to imagine that in this spot a foul murder had been committed, and&#10;that the sufferers were in all probability Hans Pfaall and his&#10;associates. But to return.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The balloon (for such no doubt it was) had now descended to&#10;within a hundred feet of the earth, allowing the crowd below a&#10;sufficiently distinct view of the person of its occupant. This was&#10;in truth a very droll little somebody. He could not have been more&#10;than two feet in height; but this altitude, little as it was, would&#10;have been sufficient to destroy his equilibrium, and tilt him over&#10;the edge of his tiny car, but for the intervention of a circular&#10;rim reaching as high as the breast, and rigged on to the cords of&#10;the balloon. The body of the little man was more than&#10;proportionately broad, giving to his entire figure a rotundity&#10;highly absurd. His feet, of course, could not be seen at all,&#10;although a horny substance of suspicious nature was occasionally&#10;protruded through a rent in the bottom of the car, or to speak more&#10;properly, in the top of the hat. His hands were enormously large.&#10;His hair was extremely gray, and collected in a cue behind. His&#10;nose was prodigiously long, crooked, and inflammatory; his eyes&#10;full, brilliant, and acute; his chin and cheeks, although wrinkled&#10;with age, were broad, puffy, and double; but of ears of any kind or&#10;character there was not a semblance to be discovered upon any&#10;portion of his head. This odd little gentleman was dressed in a&#10;loose surtout of sky-blue satin, with tight breeches to match,&#10;fastened with silver buckles at the knees. His vest was of some&#10;bright yellow material; a white taffety cap was set jauntily on one&#10;side of his head; and, to complete his equipment, a blood-red silk&#10;handkerchief enveloped his throat, and fell down, in a dainty&#10;manner, upon his bosom, in a fantastic bow-knot of super-eminent&#10;dimensions.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Having descended, as I said before, to about one hundred feet&#10;from the surface of the earth, the little old gentleman was&#10;suddenly seized with a fit of trepidation, and appeared disinclined&#10;to make any nearer approach to terra firma. Throwing out,&#10;therefore, a quantity of sand from a canvas bag, which, he lifted&#10;with great difficulty, he became stationary in an instant. He then&#10;proceeded, in a hurried and agitated manner, to extract from a&#10;side-pocket in his surtout a large morocco pocket-book. This he&#10;poised suspiciously in his hand, then eyed it with an air of&#10;extreme surprise, and was evidently astonished at its weight. He at&#10;length opened it, and drawing there from a huge letter sealed with&#10;red sealing-wax and tied carefully with red tape, let it fall&#10;precisely at the feet of the burgomaster, Superbus Von Underduk.&#10;His Excellency stooped to take it up. But the aeronaut, still&#10;greatly discomposed, and having apparently no farther business to&#10;detain him in Rotterdam, began at this moment to make busy&#10;preparations for departure; and it being necessary to discharge a&#10;portion of ballast to enable him to reascend, the half dozen bags&#10;which he threw out, one after another, without taking the trouble&#10;to empty their contents, tumbled, every one of them, most&#10;unfortunately upon the back of the burgomaster, and rolled him over&#10;and over no less than one-and-twenty times, in the face of every&#10;man in Rotterdam. It is not to be supposed, however, that the great&#10;Underduk suffered this impertinence on the part of the little old&#10;man to pass off with impunity. It is said, on the contrary, that&#10;during each and every one of his one-and twenty circumvolutions he&#10;emitted no less than one-and-twenty distinct and furious whiffs&#10;from his pipe, to which he held fast the whole time with all his&#10;might, and to which he intends holding fast until the day of his&#10;death.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In the meantime the balloon arose like a lark, and, soaring far&#10;away above the city, at length drifted quietly behind a cloud&#10;similar to that from which it had so oddly emerged, and was thus&#10;lost forever to the wondering eyes of the good citiezns of&#10;Rotterdam. All attention was now directed to the letter, the&#10;descent of which, and the consequences attending thereupon, had&#10;proved so fatally subversive of both person and personal dignity to&#10;his Excellency, the illustrious Burgomaster Mynheer Superbus Von&#10;Underduk. That functionary, however, had not failed, during his&#10;circumgyratory movements, to bestow a thought upon the important&#10;subject of securing the packet in question, which was seen, upon&#10;inspection, to have fallen into the most proper hands, being&#10;actually addressed to himself and Professor Rub-a-dub, in their&#10;official capacities of President and Vice-President of the&#10;Rotterdam College of Astronomy. It was accordingly opened by those&#10;dignitaries upon the spot, and found to contain the following&#10;extraordinary, and indeed very serious, communications.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;To their Excellencies Von Underduk and Rub-a-dub, President and&#10;Vice-President of the States&#39; College of Astronomers, in the city&#10;of Rotterdam.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Your Excellencies may perhaps be able to remember an humble&#10;artizan, by name Hans Pfaall, and by occupation a mender of&#10;bellows, who, with three others, disappeared from Rotterdam, about&#10;five years ago, in a manner which must have been considered by all&#10;parties at once sudden, and extremely unaccountable. If, however,&#10;it so please your Excellencies, I, the writer of this&#10;communication, am the identical Hans Pfaall himself. It is well&#10;known to most of my fellow citizens, that for the period of forty&#10;years I continued to occupy the little square brick building, at&#10;the head of the alley called Sauerkraut, in which I resided at the&#10;time of my disappearance. My ancestors have also resided therein&#10;time out of mind&#8212;they, as well as myself, steadily following the&#10;respectable and indeed lucrative profession of mending of bellows.&#10;For, to speak the truth, until of late years, that the heads of all&#10;the people have been set agog with politics, no better business&#10;than my own could an honest citizen of Rotterdam either desire or&#10;deserve. Credit was good, employment was never wanting, and on all&#10;hands there was no lack of either money or good-will. But, as I was&#10;saying, we soon began to feel the effects of liberty and long&#10;speeches, and radicalism, and all that sort of thing. People who&#10;were formerly, the very best customers in the world, had now not a&#10;moment of time to think of us at all. They had, so they said, as&#10;much as they could do to read about the revolutions, and keep up&#10;with the march of intellect and the spirit of the age. If a fire&#10;wanted fanning, it could readily be fanned with a newspaper, and as&#10;the government grew weaker, I have no doubt that leather and iron&#10;acquired durability in proportion, for, in a very short time, there&#10;was not a pair of bellows in all Rotterdam that ever stood in need&#10;of a stitch or required the assistance of a hammer. This was a&#10;state of things not to be endured. I soon grew as poor as a rat,&#10;and, having a wife and children to provide for, my burdens at&#10;length became intolerable, and I spent hour after hour in&#10;reflecting upon the most convenient method of putting an end to my&#10;life. Duns, in the meantime, left me little leisure for&#10;contemplation. My house was literally besieged from morning till&#10;night, so that I began to rave, and foam, and fret like a caged&#10;tiger against the bars of his enclosure. There were three fellows&#10;in particular who worried me beyond endurance, keeping watch&#10;continually about my door, and threatening me with the law. Upon&#10;these three I internally vowed the bitterest revenge, if ever I&#10;should be so happy as to get them within my clutches; and I believe&#10;nothing in the world but the pleasure of this anticipation&#10;prevented me from putting my plan of suicide into immediate&#10;execution, by blowing my brains out with a blunderbuss. I thought&#10;it best, however, to dissemble my wrath, and to treat them with&#10;promises and fair words, until, by some good turn of fate, an&#10;opportunity of vengeance should be afforded me.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;One day, having given my creditors the slip, and feeling more&#10;than usually dejected, I continued for a long time to wander about&#10;the most obscure streets without object whatever, until at length I&#10;chanced to stumble against the corner of a bookseller&#39;s stall.&#10;Seeing a chair close at hand, for the use of customers, I threw&#10;myself doggedly into it, and, hardly knowing why, opened the pages&#10;of the first volume which came within my reach. It proved to be a&#10;small pamphlet treatise on Speculative Astronomy, written either by&#10;Professor Encke of Berlin or by a Frenchman of somewhat similar&#10;name. I had some little tincture of information on matters of this&#10;nature, and soon became more and more absorbed in the contents of&#10;the book, reading it actually through twice before I awoke to a&#10;recollection of what was passing around me. By this time it began&#10;to grow dark, and I directed my steps toward home. But the treatise&#10;had made an indelible impression on my mind, and, as I sauntered&#10;along the dusky streets, I revolved carefully over in my memory the&#10;wild and sometimes unintelligible reasonings of the writer. There&#10;are some particular passages which affected my imagination in a&#10;powerful and extraordinary manner. The longer I meditated upon&#10;these the more intense grew the interest which had been excited&#10;within me. The limited nature of my education in general, and more&#10;especially my ignorance on subjects connected with natural&#10;philosophy, so far from rendering me diffident of my own ability to&#10;comprehend what I had read, or inducing me to mistrust the many&#10;vague notions which had arisen in consequence, merely served as a&#10;farther stimulus to imagination; and I was vain enough, or perhaps&#10;reasonable enough, to doubt whether those crude ideas which,&#10;arising in ill-regulated minds, have all the appearance, may not&#10;often in effect possess all the force, the reality, and other&#10;inherent properties, of instinct or intuition; whether, to proceed&#10;a step farther, profundity itself might not, in matters of a purely&#10;speculative nature, be detected as a legitimate source of falsity&#10;and error. In other words, I believed, and still do believe, that&#10;truth, is frequently of its own essence, superficial, and that, in&#10;many cases, the depth lies more in the abysses where we seek her,&#10;than in the actual situations wherein she may be found. Nature&#10;herself seemed to afford me corroboration of these ideas. In the&#10;contemplation of the heavenly bodies it struck me forcibly that I&#10;could not distinguish a star with nearly as much precision, when I&#10;gazed on it with earnest, direct and undeviating attention, as when&#10;I suffered my eye only to glance in its vicinity alone. I was not,&#10;of course, at that time aware that this apparent paradox was&#10;occasioned by the center of the visual area being less susceptible&#10;of feeble impressions of light than the exterior portions of the&#10;retina. This knowledge, and some of another kind, came afterwards&#10;in the course of an eventful five years, during which I have&#10;dropped the prejudices of my former humble situation in life, and&#10;forgotten the bellows-mender in far different occupations. But at&#10;the epoch of which I speak, the analogy which a casual observation&#10;of a star offered to the conclusions I had already drawn, struck me&#10;with the force of positive conformation, and I then finally made up&#10;my mind to the course which I afterwards pursued.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It was late when I reached home, and I went immediately to bed.&#10;My mind, however, was too much occupied to sleep, and I lay the&#10;whole night buried in meditation. Arising early in the morning, and&#10;contriving again to escape the vigilance of my creditors, I&#10;repaired eagerly to the bookseller&#39;s stall, and laid out what&#10;little ready money I possessed, in the purchase of some volumes of&#10;Mechanics and Practical Astronomy. Having arrived at home safely&#10;with these, I devoted every spare moment to their perusal, and soon&#10;made such proficiency in studies of this nature as I thought&#10;sufficient for the execution of my plan. In the intervals of this&#10;period, I made every endeavor to conciliate the three creditors who&#10;had given me so much annoyance. In this I finally succeeded&#8212;partly&#10;by selling enough of my household furniture to satisfy a moiety of&#10;their claim, and partly by a promise of paying the balance upon&#10;completion of a little project which I told them I had in view, and&#10;for assistance in which I solicited their services. By these&#10;means&#8212;for they were ignorant men&#8212;I found little difficulty in&#10;gaining them over to my purpose.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Matters being thus arranged, I contrived, by the aid of my wife&#10;and with the greatest secrecy and caution, to dispose of what&#10;property I had remaining, and to borrow, in small sums, under&#10;various pretences, and without paying any attention to my future&#10;means of repayment, no inconsiderable quantity of ready money. With&#10;the means thus accruing I proceeded to procure at intervals,&#10;cambric muslin, very fine, in pieces of twelve yards each; twine; a&#10;lot of the varnish of caoutchouc; a large and deep basket of&#10;wicker-work, made to order; and several other articles necessary in&#10;the construction and equipment of a balloon of extraordinary&#10;dimensions. This I directed my wife to make up as soon as possible,&#10;and gave her all requisite information as to the particular method&#10;of proceeding. In the meantime I worked up the twine into a&#10;net-work of sufficient dimensions; rigged it with a hoop and the&#10;necessary cords; bought a quadrant, a compass, a spy-glass, a&#10;common barometer with some important modifications, and two&#10;astronomical instruments not so generally known. I then took&#10;opportunities of conveying by night, to a retired situation east of&#10;Rotterdam, five iron-bound casks, to contain about fifty gallons&#10;each, and one of a larger size; six tinned ware tubes, three inches&#10;in diameter, properly shaped, and ten feet in length; a quantity of&#10;a particular metallic substance, or semi-metal, which I shall not&#10;name, and a dozen demijohns of a very common acid. The gas to be&#10;formed from these latter materials is a gas never yet generated by&#10;any other person than myself&#8212;or at least never applied to any&#10;similar purpose. The secret I would make no difficulty in&#10;disclosing, but that it of right belongs to a citizen of Nantz, in&#10;France, by whom it was conditionally communicated to myself. The&#10;same individual submitted to me, without being at all aware of my&#10;intentions, a method of constructing balloons from the membrane of&#10;a certain animal, through which substance any escape of gas was&#10;nearly an impossibility. I found it, however, altogether too&#10;expensive, and was not sure, upon the whole, whether cambric muslin&#10;with a coating of gum caoutchouc, was not equally as good. I&#10;mention this circumstance, because I think it probable that&#10;hereafter the individual in question may attempt a balloon&#10;ascension with the novel gas and material I have spoken of, and I&#10;do not wish to deprive him of the honor of a very singular&#10;invention.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;On the spot which I intended each of the smaller casks to&#10;occupy respectively during the inflation of the balloon, I&#10;privately dug a hole two feet deep; the holes forming in this&#10;manner a circle twenty-five feet in diameter. In the centre of this&#10;circle, being the station designed for the large cask, I also dug a&#10;hole three feet in depth. In each of the five smaller holes, I&#10;deposited a canister containing fifty pounds, and in the larger one&#10;a keg holding one hundred and fifty pounds, of cannon powder.&#10;These&#8212;the keg and canisters&#8212;I connected in a proper manner with&#10;covered trains; and having let into one of the canisters the end of&#10;about four feet of slow match, I covered up the hole, and placed&#10;the cask over it, leaving the other end of the match protruding&#10;about an inch, and barely visible beyond the cask. I then filled up&#10;the remaining holes, and placed the barrels over them in their&#10;destined situation.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Besides the articles above enumerated, I conveyed to the depot,&#10;and there secreted, one of M. Grimm&#39;s improvements upon the&#10;apparatus for condensation of the atmospheric air. I found this&#10;machine, however, to require considerable alteration before it&#10;could be adapted to the purposes to which I intended making it&#10;applicable. But, with severe labor and unremitting perseverance, I&#10;at length met with entire success in all my preparations. My&#10;balloon was soon completed. It would contain more than forty&#10;thousand cubic feet of gas; would take me up easily, I calculated,&#10;with all my implements, and, if I managed rightly, with one hundred&#10;and seventy-five pounds of ballast into the bargain. It had&#10;received three coats of varnish, and I found the cambric muslin to&#10;answer all the purposes of silk itself, quite as strong and a good&#10;deal less expensive.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Everything being now ready, I exacted from my wife an oath of&#10;secrecy in relation to all my actions from the day of my first&#10;visit to the bookseller&#39;s stall; and promising, on my part, to&#10;return as soon as circumstances would permit, I gave her what&#10;little money I had left, and bade her farewell. Indeed I had no&#10;fear on her account. She was what people call a notable woman, and&#10;could manage matters in the world without my assistance. I believe,&#10;to tell the truth, she always looked upon me as an idle boy, a mere&#10;make-weight, good for nothing but building castles in the air, and&#10;was rather glad to get rid of me. It was a dark night when I bade&#10;her good-bye, and taking with me, as aides-de-camp, the three&#10;creditors who had given me so much trouble, we carried the balloon,&#10;with the car and accoutrements, by a roundabout way, to the station&#10;where the other articles were deposited. We there found them all&#10;unmolested, and I proceeded immediately to business.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It was the first of April. The night, as I said before, was&#10;dark; there was not a star to be seen; and a drizzling rain,&#10;falling at intervals, rendered us very uncomfortable. But my chief&#10;anxiety was concerning the balloon, which, in spite of the varnish&#10;with which it was defended, began to grow rather heavy with the&#10;moisture; the powder also was liable to damage. I therefore kept my&#10;three duns working with great diligence, pounding down ice around&#10;the central cask, and stirring the acid in the others. They did not&#10;cease, however, importuning me with questions as to what I intended&#10;to do with all this apparatus, and expressed much dissatisfaction&#10;at the terrible labor I made them undergo. They could not perceive,&#10;so they said, what good was likely to result from their getting wet&#10;to the skin, merely to take a part in such horrible incantations. I&#10;began to get uneasy, and worked away with all my might, for I&#10;verily believe the idiots supposed that I had entered into a&#10;compact with the devil, and that, in short, what I was now doing&#10;was nothing better than it should be. I was, therefore, in great&#10;fear of their leaving me altogether. I contrived, however, to&#10;pacify them by promises of payment of all scores in full, as soon&#10;as I could bring the present business to a termination. To these&#10;speeches they gave, of course, their own interpretation; fancying,&#10;no doubt, that at all events I should come into possession of vast&#10;quantities of ready money; and provided I paid them all I owed, and&#10;a trifle more, in consideration of their services, I dare say they&#10;cared very little what became of either my soul or my carcass.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;In about four hours and a half I found the balloon sufficiently&#10;inflated. I attached the car, therefore, and put all my implements&#10;in it&#8212;not forgetting the condensing apparatus, a copious supply of&#10;water, and a large quantity of provisions, such as pemmican, in&#10;which much nutriment is contained in comparatively little bulk. I&#10;also secured in the car a pair of pigeons and a cat. It was now&#10;nearly daybreak, and I thought it high time to take my departure.&#10;Dropping a lighted cigar on the ground, as if by accident, I took&#10;the opportunity, in stooping to pick it up, of igniting privately&#10;the piece of slow match, whose end, as I said before, protruded a&#10;very little beyond the lower rim of one of the smaller casks. This&#10;manoeuvre was totally unperceived on the part of the three duns;&#10;and, jumping into the car, I immediately cut the single cord which&#10;held me to the earth, and was pleased to find that I shot upward,&#10;carrying with all ease one hundred and seventy-five pounds of&#10;leaden ballast, and able to have carried up as many more.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Scarcely, however, had I attained the height of fifty yards,&#10;when, roaring and rumbling up after me in the most horrible and&#10;tumultuous manner, came so dense a hurricane of fire, and smoke,&#10;and sulphur, and legs and arms, and gravel, and burning wood, and&#10;blazing metal, that my very heart sunk within me, and I fell down&#10;in the bottom of the car, trembling with unmitigated terror.&#10;Indeed, I now perceived that I had entirely overdone the business,&#10;and that the main consequences of the shock were yet to be&#10;experienced. Accordingly, in less than a second, I felt all the&#10;blood in my body rushing to my temples, and immediately thereupon,&#10;a concussion, which I shall never forget, burst abruptly through&#10;the night and seemed to rip the very firmament asunder. When I&#10;afterward had time for reflection, I did not fail to attribute the&#10;extreme violence of the explosion, as regarded myself, to its&#10;proper cause&#8212;my situation directly above it, and in the line of its&#10;greatest power. But at the time, I thought only of preserving my&#10;life. The balloon at first collapsed, then furiously expanded, then&#10;whirled round and round with horrible velocity, and finally,&#10;reeling and staggering like a drunken man, hurled me with great&#10;force over the rim of the car, and left me dangling, at a terrific&#10;height, with my head downward, and my face outwards, by a piece of&#10;slender cord about three feet in length, which hung accidentally&#10;through a crevice near the bottom of the wicker-work, and in which,&#10;as I fell, my left foot became most providentially entangled. It is&#10;impossible&#8212;utterly impossible&#8212;to form any adequate idea of the&#10;horror of my situation. I gasped convulsively for breath&#8212;a shudder&#10;resembling a fit of the ague agitated every nerve and muscle of my&#10;frame&#8212;I felt my eyes starting from their sockets&#8212;a horrible nausea&#10;overwhelmed me&#8212;and at length I fainted away.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;How long I remained in this state it is impossible to say. It&#10;must, however, have been no inconsiderable time, for when I&#10;partially recovered the sense of existence, I found the day&#10;breaking, the balloon at a prodigious height over a wilderness of&#10;ocean, and not a trace of land to be discovered far and wide within&#10;the limits of the vast horizon. My sensations, however, upon thus&#10;recovering, were by no means so rife with agony as might have been&#10;anticipated. Indeed, there was much of incipient madness in the&#10;calm survey which I began to take of my situation. I drew up to my&#10;eyes each of my hands, one after the other, and wondered what&#10;occurrence could have given rise to the swelling of the veins, and&#10;the horrible blackness of the fingemails. I afterward carefully&#10;examined my head, shaking it repeatedly, and feeling it with minute&#10;attention, until I succeeded in satisfying myself that it was not,&#10;as I had more than half suspected, larger than my balloon. Then, in&#10;a knowing manner, I felt in both my breeches pockets, and, missing&#10;therefrom a set of tablets and a toothpick case, endeavored to&#10;account for their disappearance, and not being able to do so, felt&#10;inexpressibly chagrined. It now occurred to me that I suffered&#10;great uneasiness in the joint of my left ankle, and a dim&#10;consciousness of my situation began to glimmer through my mind.&#10;But, strange to say! I was neither astonished nor horror-stricken.&#10;If I felt any emotion at all, it was a kind of chuckling&#10;satisfaction at the cleverness I was about to display in&#10;extricating myself from this dilemma; and I never, for a moment,&#10;looked upon my ultimate safety as a question susceptible of doubt.&#10;For a few minutes I remained wrapped in the profoundest meditation.&#10;I have a distinct recollection of frequently compressing my lips,&#10;putting my forefinger to the side of my nose, and making use of&#10;other gesticulations and grimaces common to men who, at ease in&#10;their arm-chairs, meditate upon matters of intricacy or importance.&#10;Having, as I thought, sufficiently collected my ideas, I now, with&#10;great caution and deliberation, put my hands behind my back, and&#10;unfastened the large iron buckle which belonged to the waistband of&#10;my inexpressibles. This buckle had three teeth, which, being&#10;somewhat rusty, turned with great difficulty on their axis. I&#10;brought them, however, after some trouble, at right angles to the&#10;body of the buckle, and was glad to find them remain firm in that&#10;position. Holding the instrument thus obtained within my teeth, I&#10;now proceeded to untie the knot of my cravat. I had to rest several&#10;times before I could accomplish this manoeuvre, but it was at&#10;length accomplished. To one end of the cravat I then made fast the&#10;buckle, and the other end I tied, for greater security, tightly&#10;around my wrist. Drawing now my body upwards, with a prodigious&#10;exertion of muscular force, I succeeded, at the very first trial,&#10;in throwing the buckle over the car, and entangling it, as I had&#10;anticipated, in the circular rim of the wicker-work.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My body was now inclined towards the side of the car, at an&#10;angle of about forty-five degrees; but it must not be understood&#10;that I was therefore only forty-five degrees below the&#10;perpendicular. So far from it, I still lay nearly level with the&#10;plane of the horizon; for the change of situation which I had&#10;acquired, had forced the bottom of the car considerably outwards&#10;from my position, which was accordingly one of the most imminent&#10;and deadly peril. It should be remembered, however, that when I&#10;fell in the first instance, from the car, if I had fallen with my&#10;face turned toward the balloon, instead of turned outwardly from&#10;it, as it actually was; or if, in the second place, the cord by&#10;which I was suspended had chanced to hang over the upper edge,&#10;instead of through a crevice near the bottom of the car,&#8212;I say it&#10;may be readily conceived that, in either of these supposed cases, I&#10;should have been unable to accomplish even as much as I had now&#10;accomplished, and the wonderful adventures of Hans Pfaall would&#10;have been utterly lost to posterity, I had therefore every reason&#10;to be grateful; although, in point of fact, I was still too stupid&#10;to be anything at all, and hung for, perhaps, a quarter of an hour&#10;in that extraordinary manner, without making the slightest farther&#10;exertion whatsoever, and in a singularly tranquil state of idiotic&#10;enjoyment. But this feeling did not fail to die rapidly away, and&#10;thereunto succeeded horror, and dismay, and a chilling sense of&#10;utter helplessness and ruin. In fact, the blood so long&#10;accumulating in the vessels of my head and throat, and which had&#10;hitherto buoyed up my spirits with madness and delirium, had now&#10;begun to retire within their proper channels, and the distinctness&#10;which was thus added to my perception of the danger, merely served&#10;to deprive me of the self-possession and courage to encounter it.&#10;But this weakness was, luckily for me, of no very long duration. In&#10;good time came to my rescue the spirit of despair, and, with&#10;frantic cries and struggles, I jerked my way bodily upwards, till&#10;at length, clutching with a vise-like grip the long-desired rim, I&#10;writhed my person over it, and fell headlong and shuddering within&#10;the car.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It was not until some time afterward that I recovered myself&#10;sufficiently to attend to the ordinary cares of the balloon. I&#10;then, however, examined it with attention, and found it, to my&#10;great relief, uninjured. My implements were all safe, and,&#10;fortunately, I had lost neither ballast nor provisions. Indeed, I&#10;had so well secured them in their places, that such an accident was&#10;entirely out of the question. Looking at my watch, I found it six&#10;o&#39;clock. I was still rapidly ascending, and my barometer gave a&#10;present altitude of three and three-quarter miles. Immediately&#10;beneath me in the ocean, lay a small black object, slightly oblong&#10;in shape, seemingly about the size, and in every way bearing a&#10;great resemblance to one of those childish toys called a domino.&#10;Bringing my telescope to bear upon it, I plainly discerned it to be&#10;a British ninety four-gun ship, close-hauled, and pitching heavily&#10;in the sea with her head to the W.S.W. Besides this ship, I saw&#10;nothing but the ocean and the sky, and the sun, which had long&#10;arisen.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It is now high time that I should explain to your Excellencies&#10;the object of my perilous voyage. Your Excellencies will bear in&#10;mind that distressed circumstances in Rotterdam had at length&#10;driven me to the resolution of committing suicide. It was not,&#10;however, that to life itself I had any, positive disgust, but that&#10;I was harassed beyond endurance by the adventitious miseries&#10;attending my situation. In this state of mind, wishing to live, yet&#10;wearied with life, the treatise at the stall of the bookseller&#10;opened a resource to my imagination. I then finally made up my&#10;mind. I determined to depart, yet live&#8212;to leave the world, yet&#10;continue to exist&#8212;in short, to drop enigmas, I resolved, let what&#10;would ensue, to force a passage, if I could, to the moon. Now, lest&#10;I should be supposed more of a madman than I actually am, I will&#10;detail, as well as I am able, the considerations which led me to&#10;believe that an achievement of this nature, although without doubt&#10;difficult, and incontestably full of danger, was not absolutely, to&#10;a bold spirit, beyond the confines of the possible.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The moon&#39;s actual distance from the earth was the first thing&#10;to be attended to. Now, the mean or average interval between the&#10;centres of the two planets is 59.9643 of the earth&#39;s equatorial&#10;radii, or only about 237,000 miles. I say the mean or average&#10;interval. But it must be borne in mind that the form of the moon&#39;s&#10;orbit being an ellipse of eccentricity amounting to no less than&#10;0.05484 of the major semi-axis of the ellipse itself, and the&#10;earth&#39;s centre being situated in its focus, if I could, in any&#10;manner, contrive to meet the moon, as it were, in its perigee, the&#10;above mentioned distance would be materially diminished. But, to&#10;say nothing at present of this possibility, it was very certain&#10;that, at all events, from the 237,000 miles I would have to deduct&#10;the radius of the earth, say 4,000, and the radius of the moon, say&#10;1080, in all 5,080, leaving an actual interval to be traversed,&#10;under average circumstances, of 231,920 miles. Now this, I&#10;reflected, was no very extraordinary distance. Travelling on land&#10;has been repeatedly accomplished at the rate of thirty miles per&#10;hour, and indeed a much greater speed may be anticipated. But even&#10;at this velocity, it would take me no more than 322 days to reach&#10;the surface of the moon. There were, however, many particulars&#10;inducing me to believe that my average rate of travelling might&#10;possibly very much exceed that of thirty miles per hour, and, as&#10;these considerations did not fail to make a deep impression upon my&#10;mind, I will mention them more fully hereafter.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The next point to be regarded was a matter of far greater&#10;importance. From indications afforded by the barometer, we find&#10;that, in ascensions from the surface of the earth we have, at the&#10;height of 1,000 feet, left below us about one-thirtieth of the&#10;entire mass of atmospheric air, that at 10,600 we have ascended&#10;through nearly one-third; and that at 18,000, which is not far from&#10;the elevation of Cotopaxi, we have surmounted one-half the&#10;material, or, at all events, one-half the ponderable, body of air&#10;incumbent upon our globe. It is also calculated that at an altitude&#10;not exceeding the hundredth part of the earth&#39;s diameter&#8212;that is,&#10;not exceeding eighty miles&#8212;the rarefaction would be so excessive&#10;that animal life could in no manner be sustained, and, moreover,&#10;that the most delicate means we possess of ascertaining the&#10;presence of the atmosphere would be inadequate to assure us of its&#10;existence. But I did not fail to perceive that these latter&#10;calculations are founded altogether on our experimental knowledge&#10;of the properties of air, and the mechanical laws regulating its&#10;dilation and compression, in what may be called, comparatively&#10;speaking, the immediate vicinity of the earth itself; and, at the&#10;same time, it is taken for granted that animal life is and must be&#10;essentially incapable of modification at any given unattainable&#10;distance from the surface. Now, all such reasoning and from such&#10;data must, of course, be simply analogical. The greatest height&#10;ever reached by man was that of 25,000 feet, attained in the&#10;aeronautic expedition of Messieurs Gay-Lussac and Biot. This is a&#10;moderate altitude, even when compared with the eighty miles in&#10;question; and I could not help thinking that the subject admitted&#10;room for doubt and great latitude for speculation.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But, in point of fact, an ascension being made to any given&#10;altitude, the ponderable quantity of air surmounted in any farther&#10;ascension is by no means in proportion to the additional height&#10;ascended (as may be plainly seen from what has been stated before),&#10;but in a ratio constantly decreasing. It is therefore evident that,&#10;ascend as high as we may, we cannot, literally speaking, arrive at&#10;a limit beyond which no atmosphere is to be found. It must exist, I&#10;argued; although it may exist in a state of infinite&#10;rarefaction.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;On the other hand, I was aware that arguments have not been&#10;wanting to prove the existence of a real and definite limit to the&#10;atmosphere, beyond which there is absolutely no air whatsoever. But&#10;a circumstance which has been left out of view by those who contend&#10;for such a limit seemed to me, although no positive refutation of&#10;their creed, still a point worthy very serious investigation. On&#10;comparing the intervals between the successive arrivals of Encke&#39;s&#10;comet at its perihelion, after giving credit, in the most exact&#10;manner, for all the disturbances due to the attractions of the&#10;planets, it appears that the periods are gradually diminishing;&#10;that is to say, the major axis of the comet&#39;s ellipse is growing&#10;shorter, in a slow but perfectly regular decrease. Now, this is&#10;precisely what ought to be the case, if we suppose a resistance&#10;experienced from the comet from an extremely rare ethereal medium&#10;pervading the regions of its orbit. For it is evident that such a&#10;medium must, in retarding the comet&#39;s velocity, increase its&#10;centripetal, by weakening its centrifugal force. In other words,&#10;the sun&#39;s attraction would be constantly attaining greater power,&#10;and the comet would be drawn nearer at every revolution. Indeed,&#10;there is no other way of accounting for the variation in question.&#10;But again. The real diameter of the same comet&#39;s nebulosity is&#10;observed to contract rapidly as it approaches the sun, and dilate&#10;with equal rapidity in its departure towards its aphelion. Was I&#10;not justifiable in supposing with M. Valz, that this apparent&#10;condensation of volume has its origin in the compression of the&#10;same ethereal medium I have spoken of before, and which is only&#10;denser in proportion to its solar vicinity? The lenticular-shaped&#10;phenomenon, also called the zodiacal light, was a matter worthy of&#10;attention. This radiance, so apparent in the tropics, and which&#10;cannot be mistaken for any meteoric lustre, extends from the&#10;horizon obliquely upward, and follows generally the direction of&#10;the sun&#39;s equator. It appeared to me evidently in the nature of a&#10;rare atmosphere extending from the sun outward, beyond the orbit of&#10;Venus at least, and I believed indefinitely farther.2 Indeed, this&#10;medium I could not suppose confined to the path of the comet&#39;s&#10;ellipse, or to the immediate neighborhood of the sun. It was easy,&#10;on the contrary, to imagine it pervading the entire regions of our&#10;planetary system, condensed into what we call atmosphere at the&#10;planets themselves, and perhaps at some of them modified by&#10;considerations, so to speak, purely geological.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Having adopted this view of the subject, I had little further&#10;hesitation. Granting that on my passage I should meet with&#10;atmosphere essentially the same as at the surface of the earth, I&#10;conceived that, by means of the very ingenious apparatus of M.&#10;Grimm, I should readily be enabled to condense it in sufficient&#10;quantity for the purposes of respiration. This would remove the&#10;chief obstacle in a journey to the moon. I had indeed spent some&#10;money and great labor in adapting the apparatus to the object&#10;intended, and confidently looked forward to its successful&#10;application, if I could manage to complete the voyage within any&#10;reasonable period. This brings me back to the rate at which it&#10;might be possible to travel.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It is true that balloons, in the first stage of their&#10;ascensions from the earth, are known to rise with a velocity&#10;comparatively moderate. Now, the power of elevation lies altogether&#10;in the superior lightness of the gas in the balloon compared with&#10;the atmospheric air; and, at first sight, it does not appear&#10;probable that, as the balloon acquires altitude, and consequently&#10;arrives successively in atmospheric strata of densities rapidly&#10;diminishing&#8212;I say, it does not appear at all reasonable that, in&#10;this its progress upwards, the original velocity should be&#10;accelerated. On the other hand, I was not aware that, in any&#10;recorded ascension, a diminution was apparent in the absolute rate&#10;of ascent; although such should have been the case, if on account&#10;of nothing else, on account of the escape of gas through balloons&#10;ill-constructed, and varnished with no better material than the&#10;ordinary varnish. It seemed, therefore, that the effect of such&#10;escape was only sufficient to counterbalance the effect of some&#10;accelerating power. I now considered that, provided in my passage I&#10;found the medium I had imagined, and provided that it should prove&#10;to be actually and essentially what we denominate atmospheric air,&#10;it could make comparatively little difference at what extreme state&#10;of rarefaction I should discover it&#8212;that is to say, in regard to my&#10;power of ascending&#8212;for the gas in the balloon would not only be&#10;itself subject to rarefaction partially similar (in proportion to&#10;the occurrence of which, I could suffer an escape of so much as&#10;would be requisite to prevent explosion), but, being what it was,&#10;would, at all events, continue specifically lighter than any&#10;compound whatever of mere nitrogen and oxygen. In the meantime, the&#10;force of gravitation would be constantly diminishing, in proportion&#10;to the squares of the distances, and thus, with a velocity&#10;prodigiously accelerating, I should at length arrive in those&#10;distant regions where the force of the earth&#39;s attraction would be&#10;superseded by that of the moon. In accordance with these ideas, I&#10;did not think it worth while to encumber myself with more&#10;provisions than would be sufficient for a period of forty days.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;There was still, however, another difficulty, which occasioned&#10;me some little disquietude. It has been observed, that, in balloon&#10;ascensions to any considerable height, besides the pain attending&#10;respiration, great uneasiness is experienced about the head and&#10;body, often accompanied with bleeding at the nose, and other&#10;symptoms of an alarming kind, and growing more and more&#10;inconvenient in proportion to the altitude attained.3 This was a&#10;reflection of a nature somewhat startling. Was it not probable that&#10;these symptoms would increase indefinitely, or at least until&#10;terminated by death itself? I finally thought not. Their origin was&#10;to be looked for in the progressive removal of the customary&#10;atmospheric pressure upon the surface of the body, and consequent&#10;distention of the superficial blood-vessels&#8212;not in any positive&#10;disorganization of the animal system, as in the case of difficulty&#10;in breathing, where the atmospheric density is chemically&#10;insufficient for the due renovation of blood in a ventricle of the&#10;heart. Unless for default of this renovation, I could see no&#10;reason, therefore, why life could not be sustained even in a&#10;vacuum; for the expansion and compression of chest, commonly called&#10;breathing, is action purely muscular, and the cause, not the&#10;effect, of respiration. In a word, I conceived that, as the body&#10;should become habituated to the want of atmospheric pressure, the&#10;sensations of pain would gradually diminish&#8212;and to endure them&#10;while they continued, I relied with confidence upon the iron&#10;hardihood of my constitution.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Thus, may it please your Excellencies, I have detailed some,&#10;though by no means all, the considerations which led me to form the&#10;project of a lunar voyage. I shall now proceed to lay before you&#10;the result of an attempt so apparently audacious in conception,&#10;and, at all events, so utterly unparalleled in the annals of&#10;mankind.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Having attained the altitude before mentioned, that is to say&#10;three miles and three-quarters, I threw out from the car a quantity&#10;of feathers, and found that I still ascended with sufficient&#10;rapidity; there was, therefore, no necessity for discharging any&#10;ballast. I was glad of this, for I wished to retain with me as much&#10;weight as I could carry, for reasons which will be explained in the&#10;sequel. I as yet suffered no bodily inconvenience, breathing with&#10;great freedom, and feeling no pain whatever in the head. The cat&#10;was lying very demurely upon my coat, which I had taken off, and&#10;eyeing the pigeons with an air of nonchalance. These latter being&#10;tied by the leg, to prevent their escape, were busily employed in&#10;picking up some grains of rice scattered for them in the bottom of&#10;the car.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;At twenty minutes past six o&#39;clock, the barometer showed an&#10;elevation of 26,400 feet, or five miles to a fraction. The prospect&#10;seemed unbounded. Indeed, it is very easily calculated by means of&#10;spherical geometry, what a great extent of the earth&#39;s area I&#10;beheld. The convex surface of any segment of a sphere is, to the&#10;entire surface of the sphere itself, as the versed sine of the&#10;segment to the diameter of the sphere. Now, in my case, the versed&#10;sine&#8212;that is to say, the thickness of the segment beneath me&#8212;was&#10;about equal to my elevation, or the elevation of the point of sight&#10;above the surface. &#34;As five miles, then, to eight thousand,&#34; would&#10;express the proportion of the earth&#39;s area seen by me. In other&#10;words, I beheld as much as a sixteen-hundredth part of the whole&#10;surface of the globe. The sea appeared unruffled as a mirror,&#10;although, by means of the spy-glass, I could perceive it to be in a&#10;state of violent agitation. The ship was no longer visible, having&#10;drifted away, apparently to the eastward. I now began to&#10;experience, at intervals, severe pain in the head, especially about&#10;the ears&#8212;still, however, breathing with tolerable freedom. The cat&#10;and pigeons seemed to suffer no inconvenience whatsoever.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;At twenty minutes before seven, the balloon entered a long&#10;series of dense cloud, which put me to great trouble, by damaging&#10;my condensing apparatus and wetting me to the skin. This was, to be&#10;sure, a singular recontre, for I had not believed it possible that&#10;a cloud of this nature could be sustained at so great an elevation.&#10;I thought it best, however, to throw out two five-pound pieces of&#10;ballast, reserving still a weight of one hundred and sixty-five&#10;pounds. Upon so doing, I soon rose above the difficulty, and&#10;perceived immediately, that I had obtained a great increase in my&#10;rate of ascent. In a few seconds after my leaving the cloud, a&#10;flash of vivid lightning shot from one end of it to the other, and&#10;caused it to kindle up, throughout its vast extent, like a mass of&#10;ignited and glowing charcoal. This, it must be remembered, was in&#10;the broad light of day. No fancy may picture the sublimity which&#10;might have been exhibited by a similar phenomenon taking place amid&#10;the darkness of the night. Hell itself might have been found a&#10;fitting image. Even as it was, my hair stood on end, while I gazed&#10;afar down within the yawning abysses, letting imagination descend,&#10;as it were, and stalk about in the strange vaulted halls, and ruddy&#10;gulfs, and red ghastly chasms of the hideous and unfathomable fire.&#10;I had indeed made a narrow escape. Had the balloon remained a very&#10;short while longer within the cloud&#8212;that is to say&#8212;had not the&#10;inconvenience of getting wet, determined me to discharge the&#10;ballast, inevitable ruin would have been the consequence. Such&#10;perils, although little considered, are perhaps the greatest which&#10;must be encountered in balloons. I had by this time, however,&#10;attained too great an elevation to be any longer uneasy on this&#10;head.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I was now rising rapidly, and by seven o&#39;clock the barometer&#10;indicated an altitude of no less than nine miles and a half. I&#10;began to find great difficulty in drawing my breath. My head, too,&#10;was excessively painful; and, having felt for some time a moisture&#10;about my cheeks, I at length discovered it to be blood, which was&#10;oozing quite fast from the drums of my ears. My eyes, also, gave me&#10;great uneasiness. Upon passing the hand over them they seemed to&#10;have protruded from their sockets in no inconsiderable degree; and&#10;all objects in the car, and even the balloon itself, appeared&#10;distorted to my vision. These symptoms were more than I had&#10;expected, and occasioned me some alarm. At this juncture, very&#10;imprudently, and without consideration, I threw out from the car&#10;three five-pound pieces of ballast. The accelerated rate of ascent&#10;thus obtained, carried me too rapidly, and without sufficient&#10;gradation, into a highly rarefied stratum of the atmosphere, and&#10;the result had nearly proved fatal to my expedition and to myself.&#10;I was suddenly seized with a spasm which lasted for more than five&#10;minutes, and even when this, in a measure, ceased, I could catch my&#10;breath only at long intervals, and in a gasping manner&#8212;bleeding all&#10;the while copiously at the nose and ears, and even slightly at the&#10;eyes. The pigeons appeared distressed in the extreme, and struggled&#10;to escape; while the cat mewed piteously, and, with her tongue&#10;hanging out of her mouth, staggered to and fro in the car as if&#10;under the influence of poison. I now too late discovered the great&#10;rashness of which I had been guilty in discharging the ballast, and&#10;my agitation was excessive. I anticipated nothing less than death,&#10;and death in a few minutes. The physical suffering I underwent&#10;contributed also to render me nearly incapable of making any&#10;exertion for the preservation of my life. I had, indeed, little&#10;power of reflection left, and the violence of the pain in my head&#10;seemed to be greatly on the increase. Thus I found that my senses&#10;would shortly give way altogether, and I had already clutched one&#10;of the valve ropes with the view of attempting a descent, when the&#10;recollection of the trick I had played the three creditors, and the&#10;possible consequences to myself, should I return, operated to deter&#10;me for the moment. I lay down in the bottom of the car, and&#10;endeavored to collect my faculties. In this I so far succeeded as&#10;to determine upon the experiment of losing blood. Having no lancet,&#10;however, I was constrained to perform the operation in the best&#10;manner I was able, and finally succeeded in opening a vein in my&#10;right arm, with the blade of my penknife. The blood had hardly&#10;commenced flowing when I experienced a sensible relief, and by the&#10;time I had lost about half a moderate basin full, most of the worst&#10;symptoms had abandoned me entirely. I nevertheless did not think it&#10;expedient to attempt getting on my feet immediately; but, having&#10;tied up my arm as well as I could, I lay still for about a quarter&#10;of an hour. At the end of this time I arose, and found myself freer&#10;from absolute pain of any kind than I had been during the last hour&#10;and a quarter of my ascension. The difficulty of breathing,&#10;however, was diminished in a very slight degree, and I found that&#10;it would soon be positively necessary to make use of my condenser.&#10;In the meantime, looking toward the cat, who was again snugly&#10;stowed away upon my coat, I discovered to my infinite surprise,&#10;that she had taken the opportunity of my indisposition to bring&#10;into light a litter of three little kittens. This was an addition&#10;to the number of passengers on my part altogether unexpected; but I&#10;was pleased at the occurrence. It would afford me a chance of&#10;bringing to a kind of test the truth of a surmise, which, more than&#10;anything else, had influenced me in attempting this ascension. I&#10;had imagined that the habitual endurance of the atmospheric&#10;pressure at the surface of the earth was the cause, or nearly so,&#10;of the pain attending animal existence at a distance above the&#10;surface. Should the kittens be found to suffer uneasiness in an&#10;equal degree with their mother, I must consider my theory in fault,&#10;but a failure to do so I should look upon as a strong confirmation&#10;of my idea.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;By eight o&#39;clock I had actually attained an elevation of&#10;seventeen miles above the surface of the earth. Thus it seemed to&#10;me evident that my rate of ascent was not only on the increase, but&#10;that the progression would have been apparent in a slight degree&#10;even had I not discharged the ballast which I did. The pains in my&#10;head and ears returned, at intervals, with violence, and I still&#10;continued to bleed occasionally at the nose; but, upon the whole, I&#10;suffered much less than might have been expected. I breathed,&#10;however, at every moment, with more and more difficulty, and each&#10;inhalation was attended with a troublesome spasmodic action of the&#10;chest. I now unpacked the condensing apparatus, and got it ready&#10;for immediate use.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The view of the earth, at this period of my ascension, was&#10;beautiful indeed. To the westward, the northward, and the&#10;southward, as far as I could see, lay a boundless sheet of&#10;apparently unruffled ocean, which every moment gained a deeper and&#10;a deeper tint of blue and began already to assume a slight&#10;appearance of convexity. At a vast distance to the eastward,&#10;although perfectly discernible, extended the islands of Great&#10;Britain, the entire Atlantic coasts of France and Spain, with a&#10;small portion of the northern part of the continent of Africa. Of&#10;individual edifices not a trace could be discovered, and the&#10;proudest cities of mankind had utterly faded away from the face of&#10;the earth. From the rock of Gibraltar, now dwindled into a dim&#10;speck, the dark Mediterranean sea, dotted with shining islands as&#10;the heaven is dotted with stars, spread itself out to the eastward&#10;as far as my vision extended, until its entire mass of waters&#10;seemed at length to tumble headlong over the abyss of the horizon,&#10;and I found myself listening on tiptoe for the echoes of the mighty&#10;cataract. Overhead, the sky was of a jetty black, and the stars&#10;were brilliantly visible.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The pigeons about this time seeming to undergo much suffering,&#10;I determined upon giving them their liberty. I first untied one of&#10;them, a beautiful gray-mottled pigeon, and placed him upon the rim&#10;of the wicker-work. He appeared extremely uneasy, looking anxiously&#10;around him, fluttering his wings, and making a loud cooing noise,&#10;but could not be persuaded to trust himself from off the car. I&#10;took him up at last, and threw him to about half a dozen yards from&#10;the balloon. He made, however, no attempt to descend as I had&#10;expected, but struggled with great vehemence to get back, uttering&#10;at the same time very shrill and piercing cries. He at length&#10;succeeded in regaining his former station on the rim, but had&#10;hardly done so when his head dropped upon his breast, and be fell&#10;dead within the car. The other one did not prove so unfortunate. To&#10;prevent his following the example of his companion, and&#10;accomplishing a return, I threw him downward with all my force, and&#10;was pleased to find him continue his descent, with great velocity,&#10;making use of his wings with ease, and in a perfectly natural&#10;manner. In a very short time he was out of sight, and I have no&#10;doubt he reached home in safety. Puss, who seemed in a great&#10;measure recovered from her illness, now made a hearty meal of the&#10;dead bird and then went to sleep with much apparent satisfaction.&#10;Her kittens were quite lively, and so far evinced not the slightest&#10;sign of any uneasiness whatever.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;At a quarter-past eight, being no longer able to draw breath&#10;without the most intolerable pain, I proceeded forthwith to adjust&#10;around the car the apparatus belonging to the condenser. This&#10;apparatus will require some little explanation, and your&#10;Excellencies will please to bear in mind that my object, in the&#10;first place, was to surround myself and cat entirely with a&#10;barricade against the highly rarefied atmosphere in which I was&#10;existing, with the intention of introducing within this barricade,&#10;by means of my condenser, a quantity of this same atmosphere&#10;sufficiently condensed for the purposes of respiration. With this&#10;object in view I had prepared a very strong perfectly air-tight,&#10;but flexible gum-elastic bag. In this bag, which was of sufficient&#10;dimensions, the entire car was in a manner placed. That is to say,&#10;it (the bag) was drawn over the whole bottom of the car, up its&#10;sides, and so on, along the outside of the ropes, to the upper rim&#10;or hoop where the net-work is attached. Having pulled the bag up in&#10;this way, and formed a complete enclosure on all sides, and at&#10;botttom, it was now necessary to fasten up its top or mouth, by&#10;passing its material over the hoop of the net-work&#8212;in other words,&#10;between the net-work and the hoop. But if the net-work were&#10;separated from the hoop to admit this passage, what was to sustain&#10;the car in the meantime? Now the net-work was not permanently&#10;fastened to the hoop, but attached by a series of running loops or&#10;nooses. I therefore undid only a few of these loops at one time,&#10;leaving the car suspended by the remainder. Having thus inserted a&#10;portion of the cloth forming the upper part of the bag, I&#10;refastened the loops&#8212;not to the hoop, for that would have been&#10;impossible, since the cloth now intervened&#8212;but to a series of large&#10;buttons, affixed to the cloth itself, about three feet below the&#10;mouth of the bag, the intervals between the buttons having been&#10;made to correspond to the intervals between the loops. This done, a&#10;few more of the loops were unfastened from the rim, a farther&#10;portion of the cloth introduced, and the disengaged loops then&#10;connected with their proper buttons. In this way it was possible to&#10;insert the whole upper part of the bag between the net-work and the&#10;hoop. It is evident that the hoop would now drop down within the&#10;car, while the whole weight of the car itself, with all its&#10;contents, would be held up merely by the strength of the buttons.&#10;This, at first sight, would seem an inadequate dependence; but it&#10;was by no means so, for the buttons were not only very strong in&#10;themselves, but so close together that a very slight portion of the&#10;whole weight was supported by any one of them. Indeed, had the car&#10;and contents been three times heavier than they were, I should not&#10;have been at all uneasy. I now raised up the hoop again within the&#10;covering of gum-elastic, and propped it at nearly its former height&#10;by means of three light poles prepared for the occasion. This was&#10;done, of course, to keep the bag distended at the top, and to&#10;preserve the lower part of the net-work in its proper situation.&#10;All that now remained was to fasten up the mouth of the enclosure;&#10;and this was readily accomplished by gathering the folds of the&#10;material together, and twisting them up very tightly on the inside&#10;by means of a kind of stationary tourniquet.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;In the sides of the covering thus adjusted round the car, had&#10;been inserted three circular panes of thick but clear glass,&#10;through which I could see without difficulty around me in every&#10;horizontal direction. In that portion of the cloth forming the&#10;bottom, was likewise, a fourth window, of the same kind, and&#10;corresponding with a small aperture in the floor of the car itself.&#10;This enabled me to see perpendicularly down, but having found it&#10;impossible to place any similar contrivance overhead, on account of&#10;the peculiar manner of closing up the opening there, and the&#10;consequent wrinkles in the cloth, I could expect to see no objects&#10;situated directly in my zenith. This, of course, was a matter of&#10;little consequence; for had I even been able to place a window at&#10;top, the balloon itself would have prevented my making any use of&#10;it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;About a foot below one of the side windows was a circular&#10;opening, eight inches in diameter, and fitted with a brass rim&#10;adapted in its inner edge to the windings of a screw. In this rim&#10;was screwed the large tube of the condenser, the body of the&#10;machine being, of course, within the chamber of gum-elastic.&#10;Through this tube a quantity of the rare atmosphere circumjacent&#10;being drawn by means of a vacuum created in the body of the&#10;machine, was thence discharged, in a state of condensation, to&#10;mingle with the thin air already in the chamber. This operation&#10;being repeated several times, at length filled the chamber with&#10;atmosphere proper for all the purposes of respiration. But in so&#10;confined a space it would, in a short time, necessarily become&#10;foul, and unfit for use from frequent contact with the lungs. It&#10;was then ejected by a small valve at the bottom of the car&#8212;the&#10;dense air readily sinking into the thinner atmosphere below. To&#10;avoid the inconvenience of making a total vacuum at any moment&#10;within the chamber, this purification was never accomplished all at&#10;once, but in a gradual manner&#8212;the valve being opened only for a few&#10;seconds, then closed again, until one or two strokes from the pump&#10;of the condenser had supplied the place of the atmosphere ejected.&#10;For the sake of experiment I had put the cat and kittens in a small&#10;basket, and suspended it outside the car to a button at the bottom,&#10;close by the valve, through which I could feed them at any moment&#10;when necessary. I did this at some little risk, and before closing&#10;the mouth of the chamber, by reaching under the car with one of the&#10;poles before mentioned to which a hook had been attached.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;By the time I had fully completed these arrangements and filled&#10;the chamber as explained, it wanted only ten minutes of nine&#10;o&#39;clock. During the whole period of my being thus employed, I&#10;endured the most terrible distress from difficulty of respiration,&#10;and bitterly did I repent the negligence or rather fool-hardiness,&#10;of which I had been guilty, of putting off to the last moment a&#10;matter of so much importance. But having at length accomplished it,&#10;I soon began to reap the benefit of my invention. Once again I&#10;breathed with perfect freedom and ease&#8212;and indeed why should I not?&#10;I was also agreeably surprised to find myself, in a great measure,&#10;relieved from the violent pains which had hitherto tormented me. A&#10;slight headache, accompanied with a sensation of fulness or&#10;distention about the wrists, the ankles, and the throat, was nearly&#10;all of which I had now to complain. Thus it seemed evident that a&#10;greater part of the uneasiness attending the removal of atmospheric&#10;pressure had actually worn off, as I had expected, and that much of&#10;the pain endured for the last two hours should have been attributed&#10;altogether to the effects of a deficient respiration.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;At twenty minutes before nine o&#39;clock&#8212;that is to say, a short&#10;time prior to my closing up the mouth of the chamber, the mercury&#10;attained its limit, or ran down, in the barometer, which, as I&#10;mentioned before, was one of an extended construction. It then&#10;indicated an altitude on my part of 132,000 feet, or&#10;five-and-twenty miles, and I consequently surveyed at that time an&#10;extent of the earth&#39;s area amounting to no less than the three&#10;hundred-and-twentieth part of its entire superficies. At nine&#10;o&#39;clock I had again lost sight of land to the eastward, but not&#10;before I became aware that the balloon was drifting rapidly to the&#10;N. N. W. The convexity of the ocean beneath me was very evident&#10;indeed, although my view was often interrupted by the masses of&#10;cloud which floated to and fro. I observed now that even the&#10;lightest vapors never rose to more than ten miles above the level&#10;of the sea.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;At half past nine I tried the experiment of throwing out a&#10;handful of feathers through the valve. They did not float as I had&#10;expected; but dropped down perpendicularly, like a bullet, en&#10;masse, and with the greatest velocity&#8212;being out of sight in a very&#10;few seconds. I did not at first know what to make of this&#10;extraordinary phenomenon; not being able to believe that my rate of&#10;ascent had, of a sudden, met with so prodigious an acceleration.&#10;But it soon occurred to me that the atmosphere was now far too rare&#10;to sustain even the feathers; that they actually fell, as they&#10;appeared to do, with great rapidity; and that I had been surprised&#10;by the united velocities of their descent and my own elevation.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;By ten o&#39;clock I found that I had very little to occupy my&#10;immediate attention. Affairs went swimmingly, and I believed the&#10;balloon to be going upward witb a speed increasing momently&#10;although I had no longer any means of ascertaining the progression&#10;of the increase. I suffered no pain or uneasiness of any kind, and&#10;enjoyed better spirits than I had at any period since my departure&#10;from Rotterdam, busying myself now in examining the state of my&#10;various apparatus, and now in regenerating the atmosphere within&#10;the chamber. This latter point I determined to attend to at regular&#10;intervals of forty minutes, more on account of the preservation of&#10;my health, than from so frequent a renovation being absolutely&#10;necessary. In the meanwhile I could not help making anticipations.&#10;Fancy revelled in the wild and dreamy regions of the moon.&#10;Imagination, feeling herself for once unshackled, roamed at will&#10;among the ever-changing wonders of a shadowy and unstable land. Now&#10;there were boary and time-honored forests, and craggy precipices,&#10;and waterfalls tumbling with a loud noise into abysses without a&#10;bottom. Then I came suddenly into still noonday solitudes, where no&#10;wind of heaven ever intruded, and where vast meadows of poppies,&#10;and slender, lily-looking flowers spread themselves out a weary&#10;distance, all silent and motionless forever. Then again I journeyed&#10;far down away into another country where it was all one dim and&#10;vague lake, with a boundary line of clouds. And out of this&#10;melancholy water arose a forest of tall eastern trees, like a&#10;wilderness of dreams. And I have in mind that the shadows of the&#10;trees which fell upon the lake remained not on the surface where&#10;they fell, but sunk slowly and steadily down, and commingled with&#10;the waves, while from the trunks of the trees other shadows were&#10;continually coming out, and taking the place of their brothers thus&#10;entombed. &#34;This then,&#34; I said thoughtfully, &#34;is the very reason why&#10;the waters of this lake grow blacker with age, and more melancholy&#10;as the hours run on.&#34; But fancies such as these were not the sole&#10;possessors of my brain. Horrors of a nature most stern and most&#10;appalling would too frequently obtrude themselves upon my mind, and&#10;shake the innermost depths of my soul with the bare supposition of&#10;their possibility. Yet I would not suffer my thoughts for any&#10;length of time to dwell upon these latter speculations, rightly&#10;judging the real and palpable dangers of the voyage sufficient for&#10;my undivided attention.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;At five o&#39;clock, p.m., being engaged in regenerating the&#10;atmosphere within the chamber, I took that opportunity of observing&#10;the cat and kittens through the valve. The cat herself appeared to&#10;suffer again very much, and I had no hesitation in attributing her&#10;uneasiness chiefly to a difficulty in breathing; but my experiment&#10;with the kittens had resulted very strangely. I had expected, of&#10;course, to see them betray a sense of pain, although in a less&#10;degree than their mother, and this would have been sufficient to&#10;confirm my opinion concerning the habitual endurance of atmospheric&#10;pressure. But I was not prepared to find them, upon close&#10;examination, evidently enjoying a high degree of health, breathing&#10;with the greatest ease and perfect regularity, and evincing not the&#10;slightest sign of any uneasiness whatever. I could only account for&#10;all this by extending my theory, and supposing that the highly&#10;rarefied atmosphere around might perhaps not be, as I had taken for&#10;granted, chemically insufficient for the purposes of life, and that&#10;a person born in such a medium might, possibly, be unaware of any&#10;inconvenience attending its inhalation, while, upon removal to the&#10;denser strata near the earth, he might endure tortures of a similar&#10;nature to those I had so lately experienced. It has since been to&#10;me a matter of deep regret that an awkward accident, at this time,&#10;occasioned me the loss of my little family of cats, and deprived me&#10;of the insight into this matter which a continued experiment might&#10;have afforded. In passing my hand through the valve, with a cup of&#10;water for the old puss, the sleeves of my shirt became entangled in&#10;the loop which sustained the basket, and thus, in a moment,&#10;loosened it from the bottom. Had the whole actually vanished into&#10;air, it could not have shot from my sight in a more abrupt and&#10;instantaneous manner. Positively, there could not have intervened&#10;the tenth part of a second between the disengagement of the basket&#10;and its absolute and total disappearance with all that it&#10;contained. My good wishes followed it to the earth, but of course,&#10;I had no hope that either cat or kittens would ever live to tell&#10;the tale of their misfortune.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;At six o&#39;clock, I perceived a great portion of the earth&#39;s&#10;visible area to the eastward involved in thick shadow, which&#10;continued to advance with great rapidity, until, at five minutes&#10;before seven, the whole surface in view was enveloped in the&#10;darkness of night. It was not, however, until long after this time&#10;that the rays of the setting sun ceased to illumine the balloon;&#10;and this circumstance, although of course fully anticipated, did&#10;not fail to give me an infinite deal of pleasure. It was evident&#10;that, in the morning, I should behold the rising luminary many&#10;hours at least before the citizens of Rotterdam, in spite of their&#10;situation so much farther to the eastward, and thus, day after day,&#10;in proportion to the height ascended, would I enjoy the light of&#10;the sun for a longer and a longer period. I now determined to keep&#10;a journal of my passage, reckoning the days from one to twenty-four&#10;hours continuously, without taking into consideration the intervals&#10;of darkness.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;At ten o&#39;clock, feeling sleepy, I determined to lie down for&#10;the rest of the night; but here a difficulty presented itself,&#10;which, obvious as it may appear, had escaped my attention up to the&#10;very moment of which I am now speaking. If I went to sleep as I&#10;proposed, how could the atmosphere in the chamber be regenerated in&#10;the interim? To breathe it for more than an hour, at the farthest,&#10;would be a matter of impossibility, or, if even this term could be&#10;extended to an hour and a quarter, the most ruinous consequences&#10;might ensue. The consideration of this dilemma gave me no little&#10;disquietude; and it will hardly be believed, that, after the&#10;dangers I had undergone, I should look upon this business in so&#10;serious a light, as to give up all hope of accomplishing my&#10;ultimate design, and finally make up my mind to the necessity of a&#10;descent. But this hesitation was only momentary. I reflected that&#10;man is the veriest slave of custom, and that many points in the&#10;routine of his existence are deemed essentially important, which&#10;are only so at all by his having rendered them habitual. It was&#10;very certain that I could not do without sleep; but I might easily&#10;bring myself to feel no inconvenience from being awakened at&#10;intervals of an hour during the whole period of my repose. It would&#10;require but five minutes at most to regenerate the atmosphere in&#10;the fullest manner, and the only real difficulty was to contrive a&#10;method of arousing myself at the proper moment for so doing. But&#10;this was a question which, I am willing to confess, occasioned me&#10;no little trouble in its solution. To be sure, I had heard of the&#10;student who, to prevent his falling asleep over his books, held in&#10;one hand a ball of copper, the din of whose descent into a basin of&#10;the same metal on the floor beside his chair, served effectually to&#10;startle him up, if, at any moment, he should be overcome with&#10;drowsiness. My own case, however, was very different indeed, and&#10;left me no room for any similar idea; for I did not wish to keep&#10;awake, but to be aroused from slumber at regular intervals of time.&#10;I at length hit upon the following expedient, which, simple as it&#10;may seem, was hailed by me, at the moment of discovery, as an&#10;invention fully equal to that of the telescope, the steam-engine,&#10;or the art of printing itself.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It is necessary to premise, that the balloon, at the elevation&#10;now attained, continued its course upward with an even and&#10;undeviating ascent, and the car consequently followed with a&#10;steadiness so perfect that it would have been impossible to detect&#10;in it the slightest vacillation whatever. This circumstance favored&#10;me greatly in the project I now determined to adopt. My supply of&#10;water had been put on board in kegs containing five gallons each,&#10;and ranged very securely around the interior of the car. I&#10;unfastened one of these, and taking two ropes tied them tightly&#10;across the rim of the wicker-work from one side to the other;&#10;placing them about a foot apart and parallel so as to form a kind&#10;of shelf, upon which I placed the keg, and steadied it in a&#10;horizontal position. About eight inches immediately below these&#10;ropes, and four feet from the bottom of the car I fastened another&#10;shelf&#8212;but made of thin plank, being the only similar piece of wood&#10;I had. Upon this latter shelf, and exactly beneath one of the rims&#10;of the keg, a small earthern pitcher was deposited. I now bored a&#10;hole in the end of the keg over the pitcher, and fitted in a plug&#10;of soft wood, cut in a tapering or conical shape. This plug I&#10;pushed in or pulled out, as might happen, until, after a few&#10;experiments, it arrived at that exact degree of tightness, at which&#10;the water, oozing from the hole, and falling into the pitcher&#10;below, would fill the latter to the brim in the period of sixty&#10;minutes. This, of course, was a matter briefly and easily&#10;ascertained, by noticing the proportion of the pitcher filled in&#10;any given time. Having arranged all this, the rest of the plan is&#10;obvious. My bed was so contrived upon the floor of the car, as to&#10;bring my head, in lying down, immediately below the mouth of the&#10;pitcher. It was evident, that, at the expiration of an hour, the&#10;pitcher, getting full, would be forced to run over, and to run over&#10;at the mouth, which was somewhat lower than the rim. It was also&#10;evident, that the water thus falling from a height of more than&#10;four feet, could not do otherwise than fall upon my face, and that&#10;the sure consequences would be, to waken me up instantaneously,&#10;even from the soundest slumber in the world.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It was fully eleven by the time I had completed these&#10;arrangements, and I immediately betook myself to bed, with full&#10;confidence in the efficiency of my invention. Nor in this matter&#10;was I disappointed. Punctually every sixty minutes was I aroused by&#10;my trusty chronometer, when, having emptied the pitcher into the&#10;bung-hole of the keg, and performed the duties of the condenser, I&#10;retired again to bed. These regular interruptions to my slumber&#10;caused me even less discomfort than I had anticipated; and when I&#10;finally arose for the day, it was seven o&#39;clock, and the sun had&#10;attained many degrees above the line of my horizon.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;April 3d. I found the balloon at an immense height indeed, and&#10;the earth&#39;s apparent convexity increased in a material degree.&#10;Below me in the ocean lay a cluster of black specks, which&#10;undoubtedly were islands. Far away to the northward I perceived a&#10;thin, white, and exceedingly brilliant line, or streak, on the edge&#10;of the horizon, and I had no hesitation in supposing it to be the&#10;southern disk of the ices of the Polar Sea. My curiosity was&#10;greatly excited, for I had hopes of passing on much farther to the&#10;north, and might possibly, at some period, find myself placed&#10;directly above the Pole itself. I now lamented that my great&#10;elevation would, in this case, prevent my taking as accurate a&#10;survey as I could wish. Much, however, might be ascertained.&#10;Nothing else of an extraordinary nature occurred during the day. My&#10;apparatus all continued in good order, and the balloon still&#10;ascended without any perceptible vacillation. The cold was intense,&#10;and obliged me to wrap up closely in an overcoat. When darkness&#10;came over the earth, I betook myself to bed, although it was for&#10;many hours afterward broad daylight all around my immediate&#10;situation. The water-clock was punctual in its duty, and I slept&#10;until next morning soundly, with the exception of the periodical&#10;interruption.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;April 4th. Arose in good health and spirits, and was astonished&#10;at the singular change which had taken place in the appearance of&#10;the sea. It had lost, in a great measure, the deep tint of blue it&#10;had hitherto worn, being now of a grayish-white, and of a lustre&#10;dazzling to the eye. The islands were no longer visible; whether&#10;they had passed down the horizon to the southeast, or whether my&#10;increasing elevation had left them out of sight, it is impossible&#10;to say. I was inclined, however, to the latter opinion. The rim of&#10;ice to the northward was growing more and more apparent. Cold by no&#10;means so intense. Nothing of importance occurred, and I passed the&#10;day in reading, having taken care to supply myself with books.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;April 5th. Beheld the singular phenomenon of the sun rising&#10;while nearly the whole visible surface of the earth continued to be&#10;involved in darkness. In time, however, the light spread itself&#10;over all, and I again saw the line of ice to the northward. It was&#10;now very distinct, and appeared of a much darker hue than the&#10;waters of the ocean. I was evidently approaching it, and with great&#10;rapidity. Fancied I could again distinguish a strip of land to the&#10;eastward, and one also to the westward, but could not be certain.&#10;Weather moderate. Nothing of any consequence happened during the&#10;day. Went early to bed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;April 6th. Was surprised at finding the rim of ice at a very&#10;moderate distance, and an immense field of the same material&#10;stretching away off to the horizon in the north. It was evident&#10;that if the balloon held its present course, it would soon arrive&#10;above the Frozen Ocean, and I had now little doubt of ultimately&#10;seeing the Pole. During the whole of the day I continued to near&#10;the ice. Toward night the limits of my horizon very suddenly and&#10;materially increased, owing undoubtedly to the earth&#39;s form being&#10;that of an oblate spheroid, and my arriving above the flattened&#10;regions in the vicinity of the Arctic circle. When darkness at&#10;length overtook me, I went to bed in great anxiety, fearing to pass&#10;over the object of so much curiosity when I should have no&#10;opportunity of observing it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;April 7th. Arose early, and, to my great joy, at length beheld&#10;what there could be no hesitation in supposing the northern Pole&#10;itself. It was there, beyond a doubt, and immediately beneath my&#10;feet; but, alas! I had now ascended to so vast a distance, that&#10;nothing could with accuracy be discerned. Indeed, to judge from the&#10;progression of the numbers indicating my various altitudes,&#10;respectively, at different periods, between six A.M. on the second&#10;of April, and twenty minutes before nine A.M. of the same day (at&#10;which time the barometer ran down), it might be fairly inferred&#10;that the balloon had now, at four o&#39;clock in the morning of April&#10;the seventh, reached a height of not less, certainly, than 7,254&#10;miles above the surface of the sea. This elevation may appear&#10;immense, but the estimate upon which it is calculated gave a result&#10;in all probability far inferior to the truth. At all events I&#10;undoubtedly beheld the whole of the earth&#39;s major diameter; the&#10;entire northern hemisphere lay beneath me like a chart&#10;orthographically projected: and the great circle of the equator&#10;itself formed the boundary line of my horizon. Your Excellencies&#10;may, however, readily imagine that the confined regions hitherto&#10;unexplored within the limits of the Arctic circle, although&#10;situated directly beneath me, and therefore seen without any&#10;appearance of being foreshortened, were still, in themselves,&#10;comparatively too diminutive, and at too great a distance from the&#10;point of sight, to admit of any very accurate examination.&#10;Nevertheless, what could be seen was of a nature singular and&#10;exciting. Northwardly from that huge rim before mentioned, and&#10;which, with slight qualification, may be called the limit of human&#10;discovery in these regions, one unbroken, or nearly unbroken, sheet&#10;of ice continues to extend. In the first few degrees of this its&#10;progress, its surface is very sensibly flattened, farther on&#10;depressed into a plane, and finally, becoming not a little concave,&#10;it terminates, at the Pole itself, in a circular centre, sharply&#10;defined, wbose apparent diameter subtended at the balloon an angle&#10;of about sixty-five seconds, and whose dusky hue, varying in&#10;intensity, was, at all times, darker than any other spot upon the&#10;visible hemisphere, and occasionally deepened into the most&#10;absolute and impenetrable blackness. Farther than this, little&#10;could be ascertained. By twelve o&#39;clock the circular centre had&#10;materially decreased in circumference, and by seven P.M. I lost&#10;sight of it entirely; the balloon passing over the western limb of&#10;the ice, and floating away rapidly in the direction of the&#10;equator.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;April 8th. Found a sensible diminution in the earth&#39;s apparent&#10;diameter, besides a material alteration in its general color and&#10;appearance. The whole visible area partook in different degrees of&#10;a tint of pale yellow, and in some portions had acquired a&#10;brilliancy even painful to the eye. My view downward was also&#10;considerably impeded by the dense atmosphere in the vicinity of the&#10;surface being loaded with clouds, between whose masses I could only&#10;now and then obtain a glimpse of the earth itself. This difficulty&#10;of direct vision had troubled me more or less for the last&#10;forty-eight hours; but my present enormous elevation brought closer&#10;together, as it were, the floating bodies of vapor, and the&#10;inconvenience became, of course, more and more palpable in&#10;proportion to my ascent. Nevertheless, I could easily perceive that&#10;the balloon now hovered above the range of great lakes in the&#10;continent of North America, and was holding a course, due south,&#10;which would bring me to the tropics. This circumstance did not fail&#10;to give me the most heartful satisfaction, and I hailed it as a&#10;happy omen of ultimate success. Indeed, the direction I had&#10;hitherto taken, had filled me with uneasiness; for it was evident&#10;that, had I continued it much longer, there would have been no&#10;possibility of my arriving at the moon at all, whose orbit is&#10;inclined to the ecliptic at only the small angle of 5 degrees 8&#39;&#10;48&#34;.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;April 9th. To-day the earth&#39;s diameter was greatly diminished,&#10;and the color of the surface assumed hourly a deeper tint of&#10;yellow. The balloon kept steadily on her course to the southward,&#10;and arrived, at nine P.M., over the northern edge of the Mexican&#10;Gulf.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;April 10th. I was suddenly aroused from slumber, about five&#10;o&#39;clock this morning, by a loud, crackling, and terrific sound, for&#10;which I could in no manner account. It was of very brief duration,&#10;but, while it lasted resembled nothing in the world of which I had&#10;any previous experience. It is needless to say that I became&#10;excessively alarmed, having, in the first instance, attributed the&#10;noise to the bursting of the balloon. I examined all my apparatus,&#10;however, with great attention, and could discover nothing out of&#10;order. Spent a great part of the day in meditating upon an&#10;occurrence so extraordinary, but could find no means whatever of&#10;accounting for it. Went to bed dissatisfied, and in a state of&#10;great anxiety and agitation.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;April 11th. Found a startling diminution in the apparent&#10;diameter of the earth, and a considerable increase, now observable&#10;for the first time, in that of the moon itself, which wanted only a&#10;few days of being full. It now required long and excessive labor to&#10;condense within the chamber sufficient atmospheric air for the&#10;sustenance of life.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;April 12th. A singular alteration took place in regard to the&#10;direction of the balloon, and although fully anticipated, afforded&#10;me the most unequivocal delight. Having reached, in its former&#10;course, about the twentieth parallel of southern latitude, it&#10;turned off suddenly, at an acute angle, to the eastward, and thus&#10;proceeded throughout the day, keeping nearly, if not altogether, in&#10;the exact plane of the lunar elipse. What was worthy of remark, a&#10;very perceptible vacillation in the car was a consequence of this&#10;change of route&#8212;a vacillation which prevailed, in a more or less&#10;degree, for a period of many hours.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;April 13th. Was again very much alarmed by a repetition of the&#10;loud, crackling noise which terrified me on the tenth. Thought long&#10;upon the subject, but was unable to form any satisfactory&#10;conclusion. Great decrease in the earth&#39;s apparent diameter, which&#10;now subtended from the balloon an angle of very little more than&#10;twenty-five degrees. The moon could not be seen at all, being&#10;nearly in my zenith. I still continued in the plane of the elipse,&#10;but made little progress to the eastward.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;April 14th. Extremely rapid decrease in the diameter of the&#10;earth. To-day I became strongly impressed with the idea, that the&#10;balloon was now actually running up the line of apsides to the&#10;point of perigee- in other words, holding the direct course which&#10;would bring it immediately to the moon in that part of its orbit&#10;the nearest to the earth. The moon iself was directly overhead, and&#10;consequently hidden from my view. Great and long-continued labor&#10;necessary for the condensation of the atmosphere.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;April 15th. Not even the outlines of continents and seas could&#10;now be traced upon the earth with anything approaching&#10;distinctness. About twelve o&#39;clock I became aware, for the third&#10;time, of that appalling sound which had so astonished me before. It&#10;now, however, continued for some moments, and gathered intensity as&#10;it continued. At length, while, stupefied and terror-stricken, I&#10;stood in expectation of I knew not what hideous destruction, the&#10;car vibrated with excessive violence, and a gigantic and flaming&#10;mass of some material which I could not distinguish, came with a&#10;voice of a thousand thunders, roaring and booming by the balloon.&#10;When my fears and astonishment had in some degree subsided, I had&#10;little difficulty in supposing it to be some mighty volcanic&#10;fragment ejected from that world to which I was so rapidly&#10;approaching, and, in all probability, one of that singular class of&#10;substances occasionally picked up on the earth, and termed meteoric&#10;stones for want of a better appellation.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;April 16th. To-day, looking upward as well as I could, through&#10;each of the side windows alternately, I beheld, to my great&#10;delight, a very small portion of the moon&#39;s disk protruding, as it&#10;were, on all sides beyond the huge circumference of the balloon. My&#10;agitation was extreme; for I had now little doubt of soon reaching&#10;the end of my perilous voyage. Indeed, the labor now required by&#10;the condenser had increased to a most oppressive degree, and&#10;allowed me scarcely any respite from exertion. Sleep was a matter&#10;nearly out of the question. I became quite ill, and my frame&#10;trembled with exhaustion. It was impossible that human nature could&#10;endure this state of intense suffering much longer. During the now&#10;brief interval of darkness a meteoric stone again passed in my&#10;vicinity, and the frequency of these phenomena began to occasion me&#10;much apprehension.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;April 17th. This morning proved an epoch in my voyage. It will&#10;be remembered that, on the thirteenth, the earth subtended an&#10;angular breadth of twenty-five degrees. On the fourteenth this had&#10;greatly diminished; on the fifteenth a still more remarkable&#10;decrease was observable; and, on retiring on the night of the&#10;sixteenth, I had noticed an angle of no more than about seven&#10;degrees and fifteen minutes. What, therefore, must have been my&#10;amazement, on awakening from a brief and disturbed slumber, on the&#10;morning of this day, the seventeenth, at finding the surface&#10;beneath me so suddenly and wonderfully augmented in volume, as to&#10;subtend no less than thirty-nine degrees in apparent angular&#10;diameter! I was thunderstruck! No words can give any adequate idea&#10;of the extreme, the absolute horror and astonishment, with which I&#10;was seized possessed, and altogether overwhelmed. My knees tottered&#10;beneath me&#8212;my teeth chattered&#8212;my hair started up on end. &#34;The&#10;balloon, then, had actually burst!&#34; These were the first tumultuous&#10;ideas that hurried through my mind: &#34;The balloon had positively&#10;burst!&#8212;I was falling&#8212;falling with the most impetuous, the most&#10;unparalleled velocity! To judge by the immense distance already so&#10;quickly passed over, it could not be more than ten minutes, at the&#10;farthest, before I should meet the surface of the earth, and be&#10;hurled into annihilation!&#34; But at length reflection came to my&#10;relief. I paused; I considered; and I began to doubt. The matter&#10;was impossible. I could not in any reason have so rapidly come&#10;down. Besides, although I was evidently approaching the surface&#10;below me, it was with a speed by no means commensurate with the&#10;velocity I had at first so horribly conceived. This consideration&#10;served to calm the perturbation of my mind, and I finally succeeded&#10;in regarding the phenomenon in its proper point of view. In fact,&#10;amazement must have fairly deprived me of my senses, when I could&#10;not see the vast difference, in appearance, between the surface&#10;below me, and the surface of my mother earth. The latter was indeed&#10;over my head, and completely hidden by the balloon, while the&#10;moon&#8212;the moon itself in all its glory&#8212;lay beneath me, and at my&#10;feet.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The stupor and surprise produced in my mind by this&#10;extraordinary change in the posture of affairs was perhaps, after&#10;all, that part of the adventure least susceptible of explanation.&#10;For the bouleversement in itself was not only natural and&#10;inevitable, but had been long actually anticipated as a&#10;circumstance to be expected whenever I should arrive at that exact&#10;point of my voyage where the attraction of the planet should be&#10;superseded by the attraction of the satellite&#8212;or, more precisely,&#10;where the gravitation of the balloon toward the earth should be&#10;less powerful than its gravitation toward the moon. To be sure I&#10;arose from a sound slumber, with all my senses in confusion, to the&#10;contemplation of a very startling phenomenon, and one which,&#10;although expected, was not expected at the moment. The revolution&#10;itself must, of course, have taken place in an easy and gradual&#10;manner, and it is by no means clear that, had I even been awake at&#10;the time of the occurrence, I should have been made aware of it by&#10;any internal evidence of an inversion&#8212;that is to say, by any&#10;inconvenience or disarrangement, either about my person or about my&#10;apparatus.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It is almost needless to say that, upon coming to a due sense&#10;of my situation, and emerging from the terror which had absorbed&#10;every faculty of my soul, my attention was, in the first place,&#10;wholly directed to the contemplation of the general physical&#10;appearance of the moon. It lay beneath me like a chart&#8212;and although&#10;I judged it to be still at no inconsiderable distance, the&#10;indentures of its surface were defined to my vision with a most&#10;striking and altogether unaccountable distinctness. The entire&#10;absence of ocean or sea, and indeed of any lake or river, or body&#10;of water whatsoever, struck me, at first glance, as the most&#10;extraordinary feature in its geological condition. Yet, strange to&#10;say, I beheld vast level regions of a character decidedly alluvial,&#10;although by far the greater portion of the hemisphere in sight was&#10;covered with innumerable volcanic mountains, conical in shape, and&#10;having more the appearance of artificial than of natural&#10;protuberance. The highest among them does not exceed three and&#10;three-quarter miles in perpendicular elevation; but a map of the&#10;volcanic districts of the Campi Phlegraei would afford to your&#10;Excellencies a better idea of their general surface than any&#10;unworthy description I might think proper to attempt. The greater&#10;part of them were in a state of evident eruption, and gave me&#10;fearfully to understand their fury and their power, by the repeated&#10;thunders of the miscalled meteoric stones, which now rushed upward&#10;by the balloon with a frequency more and more appalling.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;April 18th. To-day I found an enormous increase in the moon&#39;s&#10;apparent bulk&#8212;and the evidently accelerated velocity of my descent&#10;began to fill me with alarm. It will be remembered, that, in the&#10;earliest stage of my speculations upon the possibility of a passage&#10;to the moon, the existence, in its vicinity, of an atmosphere,&#10;dense in proportion to the bulk of the planet, had entered largely&#10;into my calculations; this too in spite of many theories to the&#10;contrary, and, it may be added, in spite of a general disbelief in&#10;the existence of any lunar atmosphere at all. But, in addition to&#10;what I have already urged in regard to Encke&#39;s comet and the&#10;zodiacal light, I had been strengthened in my opinion by certain&#10;observations of Mr. Schroeter, of Lilienthal. He observed the moon&#10;when two days and a half old, in the evening soon after sunset,&#10;before the dark part was visible, and continued to watch it until&#10;it became visible. The two cusps appeared tapering in a very sharp&#10;faint prolongation, each exhibiting its farthest extremity faintly&#10;illuminated by the solar rays, before any part of the dark&#10;hemisphere was visible. Soon afterward, the whole dark limb became&#10;illuminated. This prolongation of the cusps beyond the semicircle,&#10;I thought, must have arisen from the refraction of the sun&#39;s rays&#10;by the moon&#39;s atmosphere. I computed, also, the height of the&#10;atmosphere (which could refract light enough into its dark&#10;hemisphere to produce a twilight more luminous than the light&#10;reflected from the earth when the moon is about 32 degrees from the&#10;new) to be 1,356 Paris feet; in this view, I supposed the greatest&#10;height capable of refracting the solar ray, to be 5,376 feet. My&#10;ideas on this topic had also received confirmation by a passage in&#10;the eighty-second volume of the Philosophical Transactions, in&#10;which it is stated that at an occultation of Jupiter&#39;s satellites,&#10;the third disappeared after having been about 1&#34; or 2&#34; of time&#10;indistinct, and the fourth became indiscernible near the limb.4&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Cassini frequently observed Saturn, Jupiter, and the fixed&#10;stars, when approaching the moon to occultation, to have their&#10;circular figure changed into an oval one; and, in other&#10;occultations, he found no alteration of figure at all. Hence it&#10;might be supposed, that at some times and not at others, there is a&#10;dense matter encompassing the moon wherein the rays of the stars&#10;are refracted.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Upon the resistance or, more properly, upon the support of an&#10;atmosphere, existing in the state of density imagined, I had, of&#10;course, entirely depended for the safety of my ultimate descent.&#10;Should I then, after all, prove to have been mistaken, I had in&#10;consequence nothing better to expect, as a finale to my adventure,&#10;than being dashed into atoms against the rugged surface of the&#10;satellite. And, indeed, I had now every reason to be terrified. My&#10;distance from the moon was comparatively trifling, while the labor&#10;required by the condenser was diminished not at all, and I could&#10;discover no indication whatever of a decreasing rarity in the&#10;air.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;April 19th. This morning, to my great joy, about nine o&#39;clock,&#10;the surface of the moon being frightfully near, and my&#10;apprehensions excited to the utmost, the pump of my condenser at&#10;length gave evident tokens of an alteration in the atmosphere. By&#10;ten, I had reason to believe its density considerably increased. By&#10;eleven, very little labor was necessary at the apparatus; and at&#10;twelve o&#39;clock, with some hesitation, I ventured to unscrew the&#10;tourniquet, when, finding no inconvenience from having done so, I&#10;finally threw open the gum-elastic chamber, and unrigged it from&#10;around the car. As might have been expected, spasms and violent&#10;headache were the immediate consequences of an experiment so&#10;precipitate and full of danger. But these and other difficulties&#10;attending respiration, as they were by no means so great as to put&#10;me in peril of my life, I determined to endure as I best could, in&#10;consideration of my leaving them behind me momently in my approach&#10;to the denser strata near the moon. This approach, however, was&#10;still impetuous in the extreme; and it soon became alarmingly&#10;certain that, although I had probably not been deceived in the&#10;expectation of an atmosphere dense in proportion to the mass of the&#10;satellite, still I had been wrong in supposing this density, even&#10;at the surface, at all adequate to the support of the great weight&#10;contained in the car of my balloon. Yet this should have been the&#10;case, and in an equal degree as at the surface of the earth, the&#10;actual gravity of bodies at either planet supposed in the ratio of&#10;the atmospheric condensation. That it was not the case, however, my&#10;precipitous downfall gave testimony enough; why it was not so, can&#10;only be explained by a reference to those possible geological&#10;disturbances to which I have formerly alluded. At all events I was&#10;now close upon the planet, and coming down with the most terrible&#10;impetuosity. I lost not a moment, accordingly, in throwing&#10;overboard first my ballast, then my water-kegs, then my condensing&#10;apparatus and gum-elastic chamber, and finally every article within&#10;the car. But it was all to no purpose. I still fell with horrible&#10;rapidity, and was now not more than half a mile from the surface.&#10;As a last resource, therefore, having got rid of my coat, hat, and&#10;boots, I cut loose from the balloon the car itself, which was of no&#10;inconsiderable weight, and thus, clinging with both hands to the&#10;net-work, I had barely time to observe that the whole country, as&#10;far as the eye could reach, was thickly interspersed with&#10;diminutive habitations, ere I tumbled headlong into the very heart&#10;of a fantastical-looking city, and into the middle of a vast crowd&#10;of ugly little people, who none of them uttered a single syllable,&#10;or gave themselves the least trouble to render me assistance, but&#10;stood, like a parcel of idiots, grinning in a ludicrous manner, and&#10;eyeing me and my balloon askant, with their arms set a-kimbo. I&#10;turned from them in contempt, and, gazing upward at the earth so&#10;lately left, and left perhaps for ever, beheld it like a huge,&#10;dull, copper shield, about two degrees in diameter, fixed immovably&#10;in the heavens overhead, and tipped on one of its edges with a&#10;crescent border of the most brilliant gold. No traces of land or&#10;water could be discovered, and the whole was clouded with variable&#10;spots, and belted with tropical and equatorial zones.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Thus, may it please your Excellencies, after a series of great&#10;anxieties, unheard of dangers, and unparalleled escapes, I had, at&#10;length, on the nineteenth day of my departure from Rotterdam,&#10;arrived in safety at the conclusion of a voyage undoubtedly the&#10;most extraordinary, and the most momentous, ever accomplished,&#10;undertaken, or conceived by any denizen of earth. But my adventures&#10;yet remain to be related. And indeed your Excellencies may well&#10;imagine that, after a residence of five years upon a planet not&#10;only deeply interesting in its own peculiar character, but rendered&#10;doubly so by its intimate connection, in capacity of satellite,&#10;with the world inhabited by man, I may have intelligence for the&#10;private ear of the States&#39; College of Astronomers of far more&#10;importance than the details, however wonderful, of the mere voyage&#10;which so happily concluded. This is, in fact, the case. I have&#10;much&#8212;very much which it would give me the greatest pleasure to&#10;communicate. I have much to say of the climate of the planet; of&#10;its wonderful alternations of heat and cold, of unmitigated and&#10;burning sunshine for one fortnight, and more than polar frigidity&#10;for the next; of a constant transfer of moisture, by distillation&#10;like that in vacuo, from the point beneath the sun to the point the&#10;farthest from it; of a variable zone of running water, of the&#10;people themselves; of their manners, customs, and political&#10;institutions; of their peculiar physical construction; of their&#10;ugliness; of their want of ears, those useless appendages in an&#10;atmosphere so peculiarly modified; of their consequent ignorance of&#10;the use and properties of speech; of their substitute for speech in&#10;a singular method of inter-communication; of the incomprehensible&#10;connection between each particular individual in the moon with some&#10;particular individual on the earth&#8212;a connection analogous with, and&#10;depending upon, that of the orbs of the planet and the satellites,&#10;and by means of which the lives and destinies of the inhabitants of&#10;the one are interwoven with the lives and destinies of the&#10;inhabitants of the other; and above all, if it so please your&#10;Excellencies&#8212;above all, of those dark and hideous mysteries which&#10;lie in the outer regions of the moon&#8212;regions which, owing to the&#10;almost miraculous accordance of the satellite&#39;s rotation on its own&#10;axis with its sidereal revolution about the earth, have never yet&#10;been turned, and, by God&#39;s mercy, never shall be turned, to the&#10;scrutiny of the telescopes of man. All this, and more- much&#10;more&#8212;would I most willingly detail. But, to be brief, I must have&#10;my reward. I am pining for a return to my family and to my home,&#10;and as the price of any farther communication on my part&#8212;in&#10;consideration of the light which I have it in my power to throw&#10;upon many very important branches of physical and metaphysical&#10;science&#8212;I must solicit, through the influence of your honorable&#10;body, a pardon for the crime of which I have been guilty in the&#10;death of the creditors upon my departure from Rotterdam. This,&#10;then, is the object of the present paper. Its bearer, an inhabitant&#10;of the moon, whom I have prevailed upon, and properly instructed,&#10;to be my messenger to the earth, will await your Excellencies&#39;&#10;pleasure, and return to me with the pardon in question, if it can,&#10;in any manner, be obtained.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I have the honor to be, etc., your Excellencies&#39; very humble&#10;servant,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;HANS PFAALL.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Upon finishing the perusal of this very extraordinary document,&#10;Professor Rub-a-dub, it is said, dropped his pipe upon the ground&#10;in the extremity of his surprise, and Mynheer Superbus Von Underduk&#10;having taken off his spectacles, wiped them, and deposited them in&#10;his pocket, so far forgot both himself and his dignity, as to turn&#10;round three times upon his heel in the quintessence of astonishment&#10;and admiration. There was no doubt about the matter&#8212;the pardon&#10;should be obtained. So at least swore, with a round oath, Professor&#10;Rub-a-dub, and so finally thought the illustrious Von Underduk, as&#10;he took the arm of his brother in science, and without saying a&#10;word, began to make the best of his way home to deliberate upon the&#10;measures to be adopted. Having reached the door, however, of the&#10;burgomaster&#39;s dwelling, the professor ventured to suggest that as&#10;the messenger had thought proper to disappear&#8212;no doubt frightened&#10;to death by the savage appearance of the burghers of Rotterdam&#8212;the&#10;pardon would be of little use, as no one but a man of the moon&#10;would undertake a voyage to so vast a distance. To the truth of&#10;this observation the burgomaster assented, and the matter was&#10;therefore at an end. Not so, however, rumors and speculations. The&#10;letter, having been published, gave rise to a variety of gossip and&#10;opinion. Some of the over-wise even made themselves ridiculous by&#10;decrying the whole business; as nothing better than a hoax. But&#10;hoax, with these sort of people, is, I believe, a general term for&#10;all matters above their comprehension. For my part, I cannot&#10;conceive upon what data they have founded such an accusation. Let&#10;us see what they say:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Imprimus. That certain wags in Rotterdam have certain especial&#10;antipathies to certain burgomasters and astronomers.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Don&#39;t understand at all.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Secondly. That an odd little dwarf and bottle conjurer, both of&#10;whose ears, for some misdemeanor, have been cut off close to his&#10;head, has been missing for several days from the neighboring city&#10;of Bruges.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Well&#8212;what of that?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Thirdly. That the newspapers which were stuck all over the&#10;little balloon were newspapers of Holland, and therefore could not&#10;have been made in the moon. They were dirty papers&#8212;very dirty&#8212;and&#10;Gluck, the printer, would take his Bible oath to their having been&#10;printed in Rotterdam.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He was mistaken&#8212;undoubtedly&#8212;mistaken.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Fourthly, That Hans Pfaall himself, the druken villain, and the&#10;three very idle gentlemen styled his creditors, were all seen, no&#10;longer than two or three days ago, in a tippling house in the&#10;suburbs, having just returned, with money in their pockets, from a&#10;trip beyond the sea.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Don&#39;t believe it&#8212;don&#39;t believe a word of it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Lastly. That it is an opinion very generally received, or which&#10;ought to be generally received, that the College of Astronomers in&#10;the city of Rotterdam, as well as other colleges in all other parts&#10;of the world,&#8212;not to mention colleges and astronomers in&#10;general,&#8212;are, to say the least of the matter, not a whit better,&#10;nor greater, nor wiser than they ought to be.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 1, :source => 'feedbooks')

When was it ever known that the Ammonites proved&#10;wanting to their own interests? Methinks it is no great stretch of&#10;generosity to allow us lambs for the altar of the Lord, receiving&#10;in lieu thereof thirty silver shekels per head!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Thou forgettest, however, Ben-Levi,&#34; replied Abel-Phittim,&#10;&#34;that the Roman Pompey, who is now impiously besieging the city of&#10;the Most High, has no assurity that we apply not the lambs thus&#10;purchased for the altar, to the sustenance of the body, rather than&#10;of the spirit.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Now, by the five corners of my beard!&#34; shouted the Pharisee,&#10;who belonged to the sect called The Dashers (that little knot of&#10;saints whose manner of dashing and lacerating the feet against the&#10;pavement was long a thorn and a reproach to less zealous devotees-&#10;a stumbling-block to less gifted perambulators)- &#34;by the five&#10;corners of that beard which, as a priest, I am forbidden to shave!-&#10;have we lived to see the day when a blaspheming and idolatrous&#10;upstart of Rome shall accuse us of appropriating to the appetites&#10;of the flesh the most holy and consecrated elements? Have we lived&#10;to see the day when-&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Let us not question the motives of the Philistine,&#34; interrupted&#10;Abel-Phittim, &#34;for to-day we profit for the first time by his&#10;avarice or by his generosity, but rather let us hurry to the&#10;ramparts, lest offerings should be wanting for that altar whose&#10;fire the rains of heaven cannot extinguish, and whose pillars of&#10;smoke no tempest can turn aside.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;That part of the city to which our worthy Gizbarin now hastened,&#10;and which bore the name of its architect, King David, was esteemed&#10;the most strongly fortified district of Jerusalem; being situated&#10;upon the steep and lofty hill of Zion. Here, a broad, deep,&#10;circumvallatory trench, hewn from the solid rock, was defended by a&#10;wall of great strength erected upon its inner edge. This wall was&#10;adorned, at regular interspaces, by square towers of white marble;&#10;the lowest sixty, and the highest one hundred and twenty cubits in&#10;height. But, in the vicinity of the gate of Benjamin, the wall&#10;arose by no means from the margin of the fosse. On the contrary,&#10;between the level of the ditch and the basement of the rampart,&#10;sprang up a perpendicular cliff of two hundred and fifty cubits,&#10;forming part of the precipitous Mount Moriah. So that when Simeon&#10;and his associates arrived on the summit of the tower called&#10;Adoni-Bezek- the loftiest of all the turrets around about&#10;Jerusalem, and the usual place of conference with the besieging&#10;army- they looked down upon the camp of the enemy from an eminence&#10;excelling by many feet that of the Pyramid of Cheops, and, by&#10;several, that of the temple of Belus.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Verily,&#34; sighed the Pharisee, as he peered dizzly over the&#10;precipice, &#34;the uncircumcised are as the sands by the seashore- as&#10;the locusts in the wilderness! The valley of The King hath become&#10;the valley of Adommin.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And yet,&#34; added Ben-Levi, &#34;thou canst not point me out a&#10;Philistine- no, not one- from Aleph to Tau- from the wilderness to&#10;the battlements- who seemeth any bigger than the letter Jod!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Lower away the basket with the shekels of silver!&#34; here shouted&#10;a Roman soldier in a hoarse, rough voice, which appeared to issue&#10;from the regions of Pluto- &#34;lower away the basket with the accursed&#10;coin which it has broken the jaw of a noble Roman to pronounce! Is&#10;it thus you evince your gratitude to our master Pompeius, who, in&#10;his condescension, has thought fit to listen to your idolatrous&#10;importunities? The god Phoebus, who is a true god, has been&#10;charioted for an hour- and were you not to be on the ramparts by&#10;sunrise? Aedepol! do you think that we, the conquerors of the&#10;world, have nothing better to do than stand waiting by the walls of&#10;every kennel, to traffic with the dogs of the earth? Lower away! I&#10;say- and see that your trumpery be bright in color and just in&#10;weight!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;El Elohim!&#34; ejaculated the Pharisee, as the discordant tones of&#10;the centurion rattled up the crags of the precipice, and fainted&#10;away against the temple- &#34;El Elohim!- who is the God Phoebus?- whom&#10;doth the blasphemer invoke? Thou, Buzi-Ben-Levi! who art read in&#10;the laws of the Gentiles, and hast sojourned among them who dabble&#10;with the Teraphim!- is it Nergal of whom the idolater speaketh?- or&#10;Ashimah?- or- Nibhaz?- or Tartak?- or Adramalech?- or Anamalech?-&#10;or Succoth-Benith?- or Dragon?- or Belial?- or Baal-Perith?- or&#10;Baal-Peor?- or Baal-Zebub?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Verily it is neither- but beware how thou lettest the rope slip&#10;too rapidly through thy fingers; for should the wicker-work chance&#10;to hang on the projection of yonder crag, there will be a woful&#10;outpouring of the holy things of the sanctuary.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;By the assistance of some rudely constructed machinery, the&#10;heavily laden basket was now carefully lowered down among the&#10;multitude; and, from the giddy pinnacle, the Romans were seen&#10;gathering confusedly round it; but owing to the vast height and the&#10;prevalence of a fog, no distinct view of their operations could be&#10;obtained.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Half an hour had already elapsed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;We shall be too late!&#34; sighed the Pharisee, as at the&#10;expiration of this period, he looked over into the abyss- &#34;we shall&#10;be too late! we shall be turned out of office by the Katholim.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No more,&#34; responded Abel-Phittim,- &#34;no more shall we feast upon&#10;the fat of the land- no longer shall our beards be odorous with&#10;frankincense- our loins girded up with fine linen from the&#10;Temple.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Raca!&#34; swore Ben-Levi, &#34;Raca! do they mean to defraud us of the&#10;purchase money? or, Holy Moses! are they weighing the shekels of&#10;the tabernacle?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;They have given the signal at last!&#34; cried the Pharisee- &#34;they&#10;have given the signal at last!- pull away, Abel-Phittim!- and thou,&#10;Buzi-Ben-Levi, pull away!- for verily the Philistines have either&#10;still hold upon the basket, or the Lord hath softened their hearts&#10;to place therein a beast of good weight!&#34; And the Gizbarim pulled&#10;away, while their burthen swung heavily upwards through the still&#10;increasing mist.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Booshoh he!&#34;- as, at the conclusion of an hour, some object at&#10;the extremity of the rope became indistinctly visible &#8212; &#34;Booshoh&#10;he!&#34; was the exclamation which burst from the lips of Ben-Levi.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Booshoh he!- for shame!- it is a ram from the thickets of&#10;Engedi, and as rugged as the valley of Jehosaphat!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It is a firstling of the flock,&#34; said Abel-Phittim, &#34;I know him&#10;by the bleating of his lips, and the innocent folding of his limbs.&#10;His eyes are more beautiful than the jewels of the Pectoral, and&#10;his flesh is like the honey of Hebron.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It is a fatted calf from the pastures of Bashan,&#34; said the&#10;Pharisee, &#34;the heathen have dealt wonderfully with us!- let us&#10;raise up our voices in a psalm!- let us give thanks on the shawm&#10;and on the psaltery- on the harp and on the huggab- on the cythern&#10;and on the sackbutt&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was not until the basket had arrived within a few feet of the&#10;Gizbarium, that a low grunt betrayed to their perception a hog of&#10;no common size.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Now El Emanu!&#34; slowly, and with upturned eyes ejaculated the&#10;trio, as, letting go their hold, the emancipated porker tumbled&#10;headlong among the Philistines, &#34;El Emanu!- God be with us- it is&#10;the unutterable flesh!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 1, :source => 'feedbooks')

My&#10;acquaintance with Ritzner commenced at the magnificent Chateau&#10;Jung, into which a train of droll adventures, not to be made&#10;public, threw a place in his regard, and here, with somewhat more&#10;difficulty, a partial insight into his mental conformation. In&#10;later days this insight grew more clear, as the intimacy which had&#10;at first permitted it became more close; and when, after three&#10;years of the character of the Baron Ritzner von Jung.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I remember the buzz of curiosity which his advent excited within&#10;the college precincts on the night of the twenty-fifth of June. I&#10;remember still more distinctly, that while he was pronounced by all&#10;parties at first sight &#34;the most remarkable man in the world,&#34; no&#10;person made any attempt at accounting for his opinion. That he was&#10;unique appeared so undeniable, that it was deemed impertinent to&#10;inquire wherein the uniquity consisted. But, letting this matter&#10;pass for the present, I will merely observe that, from the first&#10;moment of his setting foot within the limits of the university, he&#10;began to exercise over the habits, manners, persons, purses, and&#10;propensities of the whole community which surrounded him, an&#10;influence the most extensive and despotic, yet at the same time the&#10;most indefinite and altogether unaccountable. Thus the brief period&#10;of his residence at the university forms an era in its annals, and&#10;is characterized by all classes of people appertaining to it or its&#10;dependencies as &#34;that very extraordinary epoch forming the&#10;domination of the Baron Ritzner von Jung.&#34; then of no particular&#10;age, by which I mean that it was impossible to form a guess&#10;respecting his age by any data personally afforded. He might have&#10;been fifteen or fifty, and was twenty-one years and seven months.&#10;He was by no means a handsome man&#8212;perhaps the reverse. The contour&#10;of his face was somewhat angular and harsh. His forehead was lofty&#10;and very fair; his nose a snub; his eyes large, heavy, glassy, and&#10;meaningless. About the mouth there was more to be observed. The&#10;lips were gently protruded, and rested the one upon the other,&#10;after such a fashion that it is impossible to conceive any, even&#10;the most complex, combination of human features, conveying so&#10;entirely, and so singly, the idea of unmitigated gravity, solemnity&#10;and repose.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It will be perceived, no doubt, from what I have already said,&#10;that the Baron was one of those human anomalies now and then to be&#10;found, who make the science of mystification the study and the&#10;business of their lives. For this science a peculiar turn of mind&#10;gave him instinctively the cue, while his physical appearance&#10;afforded him unusual facilities for carrying his prospects into&#10;effect. I quaintly termed the domination of the Baron Ritzner von&#10;Jung, ever rightly entered into the mystery which overshadowed his&#10;character. I truly think that no person at the university, with the&#10;exception of myself, ever suspected him to be capable of a joke,&#10;verbal or practical:&#8212;the old bull-dog at the garden-gate would&#10;sooner have been accused,&#8212;the ghost of Heraclitus,&#8212;or the wig of&#10;the Emeritus Professor of Theology. This, too, when it was evident&#10;that the most egregious and unpardonable of all conceivable tricks,&#10;whimsicalities and buffooneries were brought about, if not directly&#10;by him, at least plainly through his intermediate agency or&#10;connivance. The beauty, if I may so call it, of his art mystifique,&#10;lay in that consummate ability (resulting from an almost intuitive&#10;knowledge of human nature, and a most wonderful self-possession,)&#10;by means of which he never failed to make it appear that the&#10;drolleries he was occupied in bringing to a point, arose partly in&#10;spite, and partly in consequence of the laudable efforts he was&#10;making for their prevention, and for the preservation of the good&#10;order and dignity of Alma Mater. The deep, the poignant, the&#10;overwhelming mortification, which upon each such failure of his&#10;praise worthy endeavors, would suffuse every lineament of his&#10;countenance, left not the slightest room for doubt of his sincerity&#10;in the bosoms of even his most skeptical companions. The&#10;adroitness, too, was no less worthy of observation by which he&#10;contrived to shift the sense of the grotesque from the creator to&#10;the created&#8212;from his own person to the absurdities to which he had&#10;given rise. In no instance before that of which I speak, have I&#10;known the habitual mystific escape the natural consequence of his&#10;manoevres&#8212;an attachment of the ludicrous to his own character and&#10;person. Continually enveloped in an atmosphere of whim, my friend&#10;appeared to live only for the severities of society; and not even&#10;his own household have for a moment associated other ideas than&#10;those of the rigid and august with the memory of the Baron Ritzner&#10;von Jung. the demon of the dolce far niente lay like an incubus&#10;upon the university. Nothing, at least, was done beyond eating and&#10;drinking and making merry. The apartments of the students were&#10;converted into so many pot-houses, and there was no pot-house of&#10;them all more famous or more frequented than that of the Baron. Our&#10;carousals here were many, and boisterous, and long, and never&#10;unfruitful of events.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Upon one occasion we had protracted our sitting until nearly&#10;daybreak, and an unusual quantity of wine had been drunk. The&#10;company consisted of seven or eight individuals besides the Baron&#10;and myself. Most of these were young men of wealth, of high&#10;connection, of great family pride, and all alive with an&#10;exaggerated sense of honor. They abounded in the most ultra German&#10;opinions respecting the duello. To these Quixotic notions some&#10;recent Parisian publications, backed by three or four desperate and&#10;fatal conversation, during the greater part of the night, had run&#10;wild upon the all&#8212;engrossing topic of the times. The Baron, who had&#10;been unusually silent and abstracted in the earlier portion of the&#10;evening, at length seemed to be aroused from his apathy, took a&#10;leading part in the discourse, and dwelt upon the benefits, and&#10;more especially upon the beauties, of the received code of&#10;etiquette in passages of arms with an ardor, an eloquence, an&#10;impressiveness, and an affectionateness of manner, which elicited&#10;the warmest enthusiasm from his hearers in general, and absolutely&#10;staggered even myself, who well knew him to be at heart a ridiculer&#10;of those very points for which he contended, and especially to hold&#10;the entire fanfaronade of duelling etiquette in the sovereign&#10;contempt which it deserves.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Looking around me during a pause in the Baron&#39;s discourse (of&#10;which my readers may gather some faint idea when I say that it bore&#10;resemblance to the fervid, chanting, monotonous, yet musical&#10;sermonic manner of Coleridge), I perceived symptoms of even more&#10;than the general interest in the countenance of one of the party.&#10;This gentleman, whom I shall call Hermann, was an original in every&#10;respect&#8212;except, perhaps, in the single particular that he was a&#10;very great fool. He contrived to bear, however, among a particular&#10;set at the university, a reputation for deep metaphysical thinking,&#10;and, I believe, for some logical talent. As a duellist he had&#10;acquired who had fAllan at his hands; but they were many. He was a&#10;man of courage undoubtedly. But it was upon his minute acquaintance&#10;with the etiquette of the duello, and the nicety of his sense of&#10;honor, that he most especially prided himself. These things were a&#10;hobby which he rode to the death. To Ritzner, ever upon the lookout&#10;for the grotesque, his peculiarities had for a long time past&#10;afforded food for mystification. Of this, however, I was not aware;&#10;although, in the present instance, I saw clearly that something of&#10;a whimsical nature was upon the tapis with my friend, and that&#10;Hermann was its especial object.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As the former proceeded in his discourse, or rather monologue I&#10;perceived the excitement of the latter momently increasing. At&#10;length he spoke; offering some objection to a point insisted upon&#10;by R., and giving his reasons in detail. To these the Baron replied&#10;at length (still maintaining his exaggerated tone of sentiment) and&#10;concluding, in what I thought very bad taste, with a sarcasm and a&#10;sneer. The hobby of Hermann now took the bit in his teeth. This I&#10;could discern by the studied hair-splitting farrago of his&#10;rejoinder. His last words I distinctly remember. &#34;Your opinions,&#10;allow me to say, Baron von Jung, although in the main correct, are,&#10;in many nice points, discreditable to yourself and to the&#10;university of which you are a member. In a few respects they are&#10;even unworthy of serious refutation. I would say more than this,&#10;sir, were it not for the fear of giving you offence (here the&#10;speaker smiled blandly), I would say, sir, that your opinions are&#10;not the opinions to be expected from a gentleman.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As Hermann completed this equivocal sentence, all eyes were&#10;turned upon the Baron. He became pale, then excessively red; then,&#10;dropping his pocket-handkerchief, stooped to recover it, when I&#10;caught a glimpse of his countenance, while it could be seen by no&#10;one else at the table. It was radiant with the quizzical expression&#10;which was its natural character, but which I had never seen it&#10;assume except when we were alone together, and when he unbent&#10;himself freely. In an instant afterward he stood erect, confronting&#10;Hermann; and so total an alteration of countenance in so short a&#10;period I certainly never saw before. For a moment I even fancied&#10;that I had misconceived him, and that he was in sober earnest. He&#10;appeared to be stifling with passion, and his face was cadaverously&#10;white. For a short time he remained silent, apparently striving to&#10;master his emotion. Having at length seemingly succeeded, he&#10;reached a decanter which stood near him, saying as he held it&#10;firmly clenched &#34;The language you have thought proper to employ,&#10;Mynheer Hermann, in addressing yourself to me, is objectionable in&#10;so many particulars, that I have neither temper nor time for&#10;specification. That my opinions, however, are not the opinions to&#10;be expected from a gentleman, is an observation so directly&#10;offensive as to allow me but one line of conduct. Some courtesy,&#10;nevertheless, is due to the presence of this company, and to&#10;yourself, at this moment, as my guest. You will pardon me,&#10;therefore, if, upon this consideration, I deviate slightly from the&#10;general usage among gentlemen in similar cases of personal affront.&#10;You will forgive me for the moderate tax I shall make upon your&#10;imagination, and endeavor to consider, for an instant, the&#10;reflection of your person in yonder mirror as the living Mynheer&#10;Hermann himself. This being done, there will be no difficulty&#10;whatever. I shall discharge this decanter of wine at your image in&#10;yonder mirror, and thus fulfil all the spirit, if not the exact&#10;letter, of resentment for your insult, while the necessity of&#10;physical violence to your real person will be obviated.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With these words he hurled the decanter, full of wine, against&#10;the mirror which hung directly opposite Hermann; striking the&#10;reflection of his person with great precision, and of course&#10;shattering the glass into fragments. The whole company at once&#10;started to their feet, and, with the exception of myself and&#10;Ritzner, took their departure. As Hermann went out, the Baron&#10;whispered me that I should follow him and make an offer of my&#10;services. To this I agreed; not knowing precisely what to make of&#10;so ridiculous a piece of business.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The duellist accepted my aid with his stiff and ultra recherche&#10;air, and, taking my arm, led me to his apartment. I could hardly&#10;forbear laughing in his face while he proceeded to discuss, with&#10;the profoundest gravity, what he termed &#34;the refinedly peculiar&#10;character&#34; of the insult he had received. After a tiresome harangue&#10;in his ordinary style, he took down from his book shelves a number&#10;of musty volumes on the subject of the duello, and entertained me&#10;for a long time with their contents; reading aloud, and commenting&#10;earnestly as he read. I can just remember the titles of some of the&#10;works. There were the &#34;Ordonnance of Philip le Bel on Single&#10;Combat&#34;; the &#34;Theatre of Honor,&#34; by Favyn, and a treatise &#34;On the&#10;Permission of Duels,&#34; by Andiguier. He displayed, also, with much&#10;pomposity, Brantome&#39;s &#34;Memoirs of Duels,&#34;&#8212;published at Cologne,&#10;1666, in the types of Elzevir&#8212;a precious and unique vellum-paper&#10;volume, with a fine margin, and bound by Derome. But he requested&#10;my attention particularly, and with an air of mysterious sagacity,&#10;to a thick octavo, written in barbarous Latin by one Hedelin, a&#10;Frenchman, and having the quaint title, &#34;Duelli Lex Scripta, et&#10;non; aliterque.&#34; From this he read me one of the drollest chapters&#10;in the world concerning &#34;Injuriae per applicationem, per&#10;constructionem, et per se,&#34; about half of which, he averred, was&#10;strictly applicable to his own &#34;refinedly peculiar&#34; case, although&#10;not one syllable of the whole matter could I understand for the&#10;life of me. Having finished the chapter, he closed the book, and&#10;demanded what I thought necessary to be done. I replied that I had&#10;entire confidence in his superior delicacy of feeling, and would&#10;abide by what he proposed. With this answer he seemed flattered,&#10;and sat down to write a note to the Baron. It ran thus:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Sir,&#8212;My friend, M. P.&#8212;, will hand you this note. I find it&#10;incumbent upon me to request, at your earliest convenience, an&#10;explanation of this evening&#39;s occurrences at your chambers. In the&#10;event of your declining this request, Mr. P. will be happy to&#10;arrange, with any friend whom you may appoint, the steps&#10;preliminary to a meeting.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With sentiments of perfect respect,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Your most humble servant,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;JOHANN HERMAN.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;To the Baron Ritzner von Jung,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Not knowing what better to do, I called upon Ritzner with this&#10;epistle. He bowed as I presented it; then, with a grave&#10;countenance, motioned me to a seat. Having perused the cartel, he&#10;wrote the following reply, which I carried to Hermann.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;SIR,&#8212;Through our common friend, Mr. P., I have received your&#10;note of this evening. Upon due reflection I frankly admit the&#10;propriety of the explanation you suggest. This being admitted, I&#10;still find great difficulty, (owing to the refinedly peculiar&#10;nature of our disagreement, and of the personal affront offered on&#10;my part,) in so wording what I have to say by way of apology, as to&#10;meet all the minute exigencies, and all the variable shadows, of&#10;the case. I have great reliance, however, on that extreme delicacy&#10;of discrimination, in matters appertaining to the rules of&#10;etiquette, for which you have been so long and so pre-eminently&#10;distinguished. With perfect certainty, therefore, of being&#10;comprehended, I beg leave, in lieu of offering any sentiments of my&#10;own, to refer you to the opinions of Sieur Hedelin, as set forth in&#10;the ninth paragraph of the chapter of &#34;Injuriae per applicationem,&#10;per constructionem, et per se,&#34; in his &#34;Duelli Lex scripta, et non;&#10;aliterque.&#34; The nicety of your discernment in all the matters here&#10;treated, will be sufficient, I am assured, to convince you that the&#10;mere circumstance of me referring you to this admirable passage,&#10;ought to satisfy your request, as a man of honor, for&#10;explanation.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With sentiments of profound respect, Your most obedient servant,&#10;VON JUNG.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Herr Johann Hermann&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Hermann commenced the perusal of this epistle with a scowl,&#10;which, however, was converted into a smile of the most ludicrous&#10;self-complacency as he came to the rigmarole about Injuriae per&#10;applicationem, per constructionem, et per se. Having finished&#10;reading, he begged me, with the blandest of all possible smiles, to&#10;be seated, while he made reference to the treatise in question.&#10;Turning to the passage specified, he read it with great care to&#10;himself, then closed the book, and desired me, in my character of&#10;confidential acquaintance, to express to the Baron von Jung his&#10;exalted sense of his chivalrous behavior, and, in that of second,&#10;to assure him that the explanation offered was of the fullest, the&#10;most honorable, and the most unequivocally satisfactory nature.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Somewhat amazed at all this, I made my retreat to the Baron. He&#10;seemed to receive Hermann&#39;s amicable letter as a matter of course,&#10;and after a few words of general conversation, went to an inner&#10;room and brought out the everlasting treatise &#34;Duelli Lex scripta,&#10;et non; aliterque.&#34; He handed me the volume and asked me to look&#10;over some portion of it. I did so, but to little purpose, not being&#10;able to gather the least particle of meaning. He then took the book&#10;himself, and read me a chapter aloud. To my surprise, what he read&#10;proved to be a most horribly absurd account of a duel between two&#10;baboons. He now explained the mystery; showing that the volume, as&#10;it appeared prima facie, was written upon the plan of the nonsense&#10;verses of Du Bartas; that is to say, the language was ingeniously&#10;framed so as to present to the ear all the outward signs of&#10;intelligibility, and even of profundity, while in fact not a shadow&#10;of meaning existed. The key to the whole was found in leaving out&#10;every second and third word alternately, when there appeared a&#10;series of ludicrous quizzes upon a single combat as practised in&#10;modern times.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Baron afterwards informed me that he had purposely thrown&#10;the treatise in Hermann&#39;s way two or three weeks before the&#10;adventure, and that he was satisfied, from the general tenor of his&#10;conversation, that he had studied it with the deepest attention,&#10;and firmly believed it to be a work of unusual merit. Upon this&#10;hint he proceeded. Hermann would have died a thousand deaths rather&#10;than acknowledge his inability to understand anything and&#10;everything in the universe that had ever been written about the&#10;duello.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;LITTLETON BARRY.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 1, :source => 'feedbooks')

Shalmanezer, as we have it in holy&#10;writings, lay three years before Samaria; yet it fell.&#10;Sardanapalus&#8212;see Diodorus&#8212;maintained himself seven in Nineveh; but&#10;to no purpose. Troy expired at the close of the second lustrum; and&#10;Azoth, as Aristaeus declares upon his honour as a gentleman, opened&#10;at last her gates to Psammetichus, after having barred them for the&#10;fifth part of a century&#8230; .&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Thou wretch!&#8212;thou vixen!&#8212;thou shrew!&#34; said I to my wife on the&#10;morning after our wedding; &#34;thou witch!&#8212;thou hag!&#8212;thou&#10;whippersnapper&#8212;thou sink of iniquity!&#8212;thou fiery-faced quintessence&#10;of all that is abominable!&#8212;thou&#8212;thou&#8212;&#34; here standing upon tiptoe,&#10;seizing her by the throat, and placing my mouth close to her ear, I&#10;was preparing to launch forth a new and more decided epithet of&#10;opprobrium, which should not fail, if ejaculated, to convince her&#10;of her insignificance, when to my extreme horror and astonishment I&#10;discovered that I had lost my breath.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The phrases &#34;I am out of breath,&#34; &#34;I have lost my breath,&#34; etc.,&#10;are often enough repeated in common conversation; but it had never&#10;occurred to me that the terrible accident of which I speak could&#10;bona fide and actually happen! Imagine&#8212;that is if you have a&#10;fanciful turn&#8212;imagine, I say, my wonder&#8212;my consternation&#8212;my&#10;despair!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There is a good genius, however, which has never entirely&#10;deserted me. In my most ungovernable moods I still retain a sense&#10;of propriety, et le chemin des passions me conduit&#8212;as Lord Edouard&#10;in the &#34;Julie&#34; says it did him&#8212;a la philosophie veritable.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Although I could not at first precisely ascertain to what degree&#10;the occurence had affected me, I determined at all events to&#10;conceal the matter from my wife, until further experience should&#10;discover to me the extent of this my unheard of calamity. Altering&#10;my countenance, therefore, in a moment, from its bepuffed and&#10;distorted appearance, to an expression of arch and coquettish&#10;benignity, I gave my lady a pat on the one cheek, and a kiss on the&#10;other, and without saying one syllable (Furies! I could not), left&#10;her astonished at my drollery, as I pirouetted out of the room in a&#10;Pas de Zephyr.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Behold me then safely ensconced in my private boudoir, a fearful&#10;instance of the ill consequences attending upon irascibility&#8212;alive,&#10;with the qualifications of the dead&#8212;dead, with the propensities of&#10;the living&#8212;an anomaly on the face of the earth&#8212;being very calm, yet&#10;breathless.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Yes! breathless. I am serious in asserting that my breath was&#10;entirely gone. I could not have stirred with it a feather if my&#10;life had been at issue, or sullied even the delicacy of a mirror.&#10;Hard fate!&#8212;yet there was some alleviation to the first overwhelming&#10;paroxysm of my sorrow. I found, upon trial, that the powers of&#10;utterance which, upon my inability to proceed in the conversation&#10;with my wife, I then concluded to be totally destroyed, were in&#10;fact only partially impeded, and I discovered that had I, at that&#10;interesting crisis, dropped my voice to a singularly deep guttural,&#10;I might still have continued to her the communication of my&#10;sentiments; this pitch of voice (the guttural) depending, I find,&#10;not upon the current of the breath, but upon a certain spasmodic&#10;action of the muscles of the throat.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Throwing myself upon a chair, I remained for some time absorbed&#10;in meditation. My reflections, be sure, were of no consolatory&#10;kind. A thousand vague and lachrymatory fancies took possesion of&#10;my soul- and even the idea of suicide flitted across my brain; but&#10;it is a trait in the perversity of human nature to reject the&#10;obvious and the ready, for the far-distant and equivocal. Thus I&#10;shuddered at self-murder as the most decided of atrocities while&#10;the tabby cat purred strenuously upon the rug, and the very water&#10;dog wheezed assiduously under the table, each taking to itself much&#10;merit for the strength of its lungs, and all obviously done in&#10;derision of my own pulmonary incapacity.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Oppressed with a tumult of vague hopes and fears, I at length&#10;heard the footsteps of my wife descending the staircase. Being now&#10;assured of her absence, I returned with a palpitating heart to the&#10;scene of my disaster.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Carefully locking the door on the inside, I commenced a vigorous&#10;search. It was possible, I thought, that, concealed in some obscure&#10;corner, or lurking in some closet or drawer, might be found the&#10;lost object of my inquiry. It might have a vapory&#8212;it might even&#10;have a tangible form. Most philosophers, upon many points of&#10;philosophy, are still very unphilosophical. William Godwin,&#10;however, says in his &#34;Mandeville,&#34; that &#34;invisible things are the&#10;only realities,&#34; and this, all will allow, is a case in point. I&#10;would have the judicious reader pause before accusing such&#10;asseverations of an undue quantum of absurdity. Anaxagoras, it will&#10;be remembered, maintained that snow is black, and this I have since&#10;found to be the case.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Long and earnestly did I continue the investigation: but the&#10;contemptible reward of my industry and perseverance proved to be&#10;only a set of false teeth, two pair of hips, an eye, and a bundle&#10;of billets-doux from Mr. Windenough to my wife. I might as well&#10;here observe that this confirmation of my lady&#39;s partiality for Mr.&#10;W. occasioned me little uneasiness. That Mrs. Lackobreath should&#10;admire anything so dissimilar to myself was a natural and necessary&#10;evil. I am, it is well known, of a robust and corpulent appearance,&#10;and at the same time somewhat diminutive in stature. What wonder,&#10;then, that the lath-like tenuity of my acquaintance, and his&#10;altitude, which has grown into a proverb, should have met with all&#10;due estimation in the eyes of Mrs. Lackobreath. But to return.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;My exertions, as I have before said, proved fruitless. Closet&#10;after closet&#8212;drawer after drawer&#8212;corner after corner&#8212;were&#10;scrutinized to no purpose. At one time, however, I thought myself&#10;sure of my prize, having, in rummaging a dressing-case,&#10;accidentally demolished a bottle of Grandjean&#39;s Oil of&#10;Archangels&#8212;which, as an agreeable perfume, I here take the liberty&#10;of recommending.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With a heavy heart I returned to my boudoir&#8212;there to ponder upon&#10;some method of eluding my wife&#39;s penetration, until I could make&#10;arrangements prior to my leaving the country, for to this I had&#10;already made up my mind. In a foreign climate, being unknown, I&#10;might, with some probability of success, endeavor to conceal my&#10;unhappy calamity&#8212;a calamity calculated, even more than beggary, to&#10;estrange the affections of the multitude, and to draw down upon the&#10;wretch the well-merited indignation of the virtuous and the happy.&#10;I was not long in hesitation. Being naturally quick, I committed to&#10;memory the entire tragedy of &#34;Metamora.&#34; I had the good fortune to&#10;recollect that in the accentuation of this drama, or at least of&#10;such portion of it as is allotted to the hero, the tones of voice&#10;in which I found myself deficient were altogether unnecessary, and&#10;the deep guttural was expected to reign monotonously&#10;throughout.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I practised for some time by the borders of a well frequented&#10;marsh;&#8212;herein, however, having no reference to a similar proceeding&#10;of Demosthenes, but from a design peculiarly and conscientiously my&#10;own. Thus armed at all points, I determined to make my wife believe&#10;that I was suddenly smitten with a passion for the stage. In this,&#10;I succeeded to a miracle; and to every question or suggestion found&#10;myself at liberty to reply in my most frog-like and sepulchral&#10;tones with some passage from the tragedy&#8212;any portion of which, as I&#10;soon took great pleasure in observing, would apply equally well to&#10;any particular subject. It is not to be supposed, however, that in&#10;the delivery of such passages I was found at all deficient in the&#10;looking asquint&#8212;the showing my teeth&#8212;the working my knees&#8212;the&#10;shuffling my feet&#8212;or in any of those unmentionable graces which are&#10;now justly considered the characteristics of a popular performer.&#10;To be sure they spoke of confining me in a strait-jacket&#8212;but, good&#10;God! they never suspected me of having lost my breath.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Having at length put my affairs in order, I took my seat very&#10;early one morning in the mail stage for &#8212;, giving it to be&#10;understood, among my acquaintances, that business of the last&#10;importance required my immediate personal attendance in that&#10;city.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The coach was crammed to repletion; but in the uncertain&#10;twilight the features of my companions could not be distinguished.&#10;Without making any effectual resistance, I suffered myself to be&#10;placed between two gentlemen of colossal dimensions; while a third,&#10;of a size larger, requesting pardon for the liberty he was about to&#10;take, threw himself upon my body at full length, and falling asleep&#10;in an instant, drowned all my guttural ejaculations for relief, in&#10;a snore which would have put to blush the roarings of the bull of&#10;Phalaris. Happily the state of my respiratory faculties rendered&#10;suffocation an accident entirely out of the question.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As, however, the day broke more distinctly in our approach to&#10;the outskirts of the city, my tormentor, arising and adjusting his&#10;shirt-collar, thanked me in a very friendly manner for my civility.&#10;Seeing that I remained motionless (all my limbs were dislocated and&#10;my head twisted on one side), his apprehensions began to be&#10;excited; and arousing the rest of the passengers, he communicated,&#10;in a very decided manner, his opinion that a dead man had been&#10;palmed upon them during the night for a living and responsible&#10;fellow-traveller; here giving me a thump on the right eye, by way&#10;of demonstrating the truth of his suggestion.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Hereupon all, one after another (there were nine in company),&#10;believed it their duty to pull me by the ear. A young practising&#10;physician, too, having applied a pocket-mirror to my mouth, and&#10;found me without breath, the assertion of my persecutor was&#10;pronounced a true bill; and the whole party expressed a&#10;determination to endure tamely no such impositions for the future,&#10;and to proceed no farther with any such carcasses for the&#10;present.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I was here, accordingly, thrown out at the sign of the &#34;Crow&#34;&#10;(by which tavern the coach happened to be passing), without meeting&#10;with any farther accident than the breaking of both my arms, under&#10;the left hind wheel of the vehicle. I must besides do the driver&#10;the justice to state that he did not forget to throw after me the&#10;largest of my trunks, which, unfortunately falling on my head,&#10;fractured my skull in a manner at once interesting and&#10;extraordinary.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The landlord of the &#34;Crow,&#34; who is a hospitable man, finding&#10;that my trunk contained sufficient to indemnify him for any little&#10;trouble he might take in my behalf, sent forthwith for a surgeon of&#10;his acquaintance, and delivered me to his care with a bill and&#10;receipt for ten dollars.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The purchaser took me to his apartments and commenced operations&#10;immediately. Having cut off my ears, however, he discovered signs&#10;of animation. He now rang the bell, and sent for a neighboring&#10;apothecary with whom to consult in the emergency. In case of his&#10;suspicions with regard to my existence proving ultimately correct,&#10;he, in the meantime, made an incision in my stomach, and removed&#10;several of my viscera for private dissection.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The apothecary had an idea that I was actually dead. This idea I&#10;endeavored to confute, kicking and plunging with all my might, and&#10;making the most furious contortions&#8212;for the operations of the&#10;surgeon had, in a measure, restored me to the possession of my&#10;faculties. All, however, was attributed to the effects of a new&#10;galvanic battery, wherewith the apothecary, who is really a man of&#10;information, performed several curious experiments, in which, from&#10;my personal share in their fulfillment, I could not help feeling&#10;deeply interested. It was a course of mortification to me,&#10;nevertheless, that although I made several attempts at&#10;conversation, my powers of speech were so entirely in abeyance,&#10;that I could not even open my mouth; much less, then, make reply to&#10;some ingenious but fanciful theories of which, under other&#10;circumstances, my minute acquaintance with the Hippocratian&#10;pathology would have afforded me a ready confutation.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Not being able to arrive at a conclusion, the practitioners&#10;remanded me for farther examination. I was taken up into a garret;&#10;and the surgeon&#39;s lady having accommodated me with drawers and&#10;stockings, the surgeon himself fastened my hands, and tied up my&#10;jaws with a pocket-handkerchief&#8212;then bolted the door on the outside&#10;as he hurried to his dinner, leaving me alone to silence and to&#10;meditation.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I now discovered to my extreme delight that I could have spoken&#10;had not my mouth been tied up with the pocket-handkerchief.&#10;Consoling myself with this reflection, I was mentally repeating&#10;some passages of the &#34;Omnipresence of the Deity,&#34; as is my custom&#10;before resigning myself to sleep, when two cats, of a greedy and&#10;vituperative turn, entering at a hole in the wall, leaped up with a&#10;flourish a la Catalani, and alighting opposite one another on my&#10;visage, betook themselves to indecorous contention for the paltry&#10;consideration of my nose.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But, as the loss of his ears proved the means of elevating to&#10;the throne of Cyrus, the Magian or Mige-Gush of Persia, and as the&#10;cutting off his nose gave Zopyrus possession of Babylon, so the&#10;loss of a few ounces of my countenance proved the salvation of my&#10;body. Aroused by the pain, and burning with indignation, I burst,&#10;at a single effort, the fastenings and the bandage. Stalking across&#10;the room I cast a glance of contempt at the belligerents, and&#10;throwing open the sash to their extreme horror and disappointment,&#10;precipitated myself, very dexterously, from the window. this moment&#10;passing from the city jail to the scaffold erected for his&#10;execution in the suburbs. His extreme infirmity and long continued&#10;ill health had obtained him the privilege of remaining unmanacled;&#10;and habited in his gallows costume&#8212;one very similar to my own,&#8212;he&#10;lay at full length in the bottom of the hangman&#39;s cart (which&#10;happened to be under the windows of the surgeon at the moment of my&#10;precipitation) without any other guard than the driver, who was&#10;asleep, and two recruits of the sixth infantry, who were drunk.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As ill-luck would have it, I alit upon my feet within the&#10;vehicle. immediately, he bolted out behind, and turning down an&#10;alley, was out of sight in the twinkling of an eye. The recruits,&#10;aroused by the bustle, could not exactly comprehend the merits of&#10;the transaction. Seeing, however, a man, the precise counterpart of&#10;the felon, standing upright in the cart before their eyes, they&#10;were of (so they expressed themselves,) and, having communicated&#10;this opinion to one another, they took each a dram, and then&#10;knocked me down with the butt-ends of their muskets.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was not long ere we arrived at the place of destination. Of&#10;course nothing could be said in my defence. Hanging was my&#10;inevitable fate. I resigned myself thereto with a feeling half&#10;stupid, half acrimonious. Being little of a cynic, I had all the&#10;sentiments of a dog. The hangman, however, adjusted the noose about&#10;my neck. The drop fell.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I forbear to depict my sensations upon the gallows; although&#10;here, undoubtedly, I could speak to the point, and it is a topic&#10;upon which nothing has been well said. In fact, to write upon such&#10;a theme it is necessary to have been hanged. Every author should&#10;confine himself to matters of experience. Thus Mark Antony composed&#10;a treatise upon getting drunk.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I may just mention, however, that die I did not. My body was,&#10;but I had no breath to be, suspended; and but for the knot under my&#10;left ear (which had the feel of a military stock) I dare say that I&#10;should have experienced very little inconvenience. As for the jerk&#10;given to my neck upon the falling of the drop, it merely proved a&#10;corrective to the twist afforded me by the fat gentleman in the&#10;coach.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For good reasons, however, I did my best to give the crowd the&#10;worth of their trouble. My convulsions were said to be&#10;extraordinary. My spasms it would have been difficult to beat. The&#10;populace encored. Several gentlemen swooned; and a multitude of&#10;ladies were carried home in hysterics. Pinxit availed himself of&#10;the opportunity to retouch, from a sketch taken upon the spot, his&#10;admirable painting of the &#34;Marsyas flayed alive.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When I had afforded sufficient amusement, it was thought proper&#10;to remove my body from the gallows;&#8212;this the more especially as the&#10;real culprit had in the meantime been retaken and recognized, a&#10;fact which I was so unlucky as not to know.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Much sympathy was, of course, exercised in my behalf, and as no&#10;one made claim to my corpse, it was ordered that I should be&#10;interred in a public vault.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Here, after due interval, I was deposited. The sexton departed,&#10;and I was left alone. A line of Marston&#39;s &#34;Malcontent&#34;-&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Death&#39;s a good fellow and keeps open house-&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;struck me at that moment as a palpable lie.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I knocked off, however, the lid of my coffin, and stepped out.&#10;The place was dreadfully dreary and damp, and I became troubled&#10;with ennui. By way of amusement, I felt my way among the numerous&#10;coffins ranged in order around. I lifted them down, one by one, and&#10;breaking open their lids, busied myself in speculations about the&#10;mortality within.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;This,&#34; I soliloquized, tumbling over a carcass, puffy, bloated,&#10;and rotund&#8212;&#34;this has been, no doubt, in every sense of the word, an&#10;unhappy&#8212;an unfortunate man. It has been his terrible lot not to&#10;walk but to waddle&#8212;to pass through life not like a human being, but&#10;like an elephant&#8212;not like a man, but like a rhinoceros.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;His attempts at getting on have been mere abortions, and his&#10;circumgyratory proceedings a palpable failure. Taking a step&#10;forward, it has been his misfortune to take two toward the right,&#10;and three toward the left. His studies have been confined to the&#10;poetry of Crabbe. He can have no idea of the wonder of a pirouette.&#10;To him a pas de papillon has been an abstract conception. He has&#10;never ascended the summit of a hill. He has never viewed from any&#10;steeple the glories of a metropolis. Heat has been his mortal&#10;enemy. In the dog-days his days have been the days of a dog.&#10;Therein, he has dreamed of flames and suffocation&#8212;of mountains upon&#10;mountains&#8212;of Pelion upon Ossa. He was short of breath&#8212;to say all in&#10;a word, he was short of breath. He thought it extravagant to play&#10;upon wind instruments. He was the inventor of self-moving fans,&#10;wind-sails, and ventilators. He patronized Du Pont the&#10;bellows-maker, and he died miserably in attempting to smoke a&#10;cigar. His was a case in which I feel a deep interest&#8212;a lot in&#10;which I sincerely sympathize.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But here,&#34;&#8212;said I&#8212;&#34;here&#34;&#8212;and I dragged spitefully from its&#10;receptacle a gaunt, tall and peculiar-looking form, whose&#10;remarkable appearance struck me with a sense of unwelcome&#10;familiarity&#8212;&#34;here is a wretch entitled to no earthly&#10;commiseration.&#34; Thus saying, in order to obtain a more distinct&#10;view of my subject, I applied my thumb and forefinger to its nose,&#10;and causing it to assume a sitting position upon the ground, held&#10;it thus, at the length of my arm, while I continued my&#10;soliloquy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;-&#34;Entitled,&#34; I repeated, &#34;to no earthly commiseration. Who&#10;indeed would think of compassioning a shadow? Besides, has he not&#10;had his full share of the blessings of mortality? He was the&#10;originator of tall monuments&#8212;shot-towers&#8212;lightning-rods&#8212;Lombardy&#10;poplars. His treatise upon &#34;Shades and Shadows&#34; has immortalized&#10;him. He edited with distinguished ability the last edition of&#10;&#34;South on the Bones.&#34; He went early to college and studied&#10;pneumatics. He then came home, talked eternally, and played upon&#10;the French-horn. He patronized the bagpipes. Captain Barclay, who&#10;walked against Time, would not walk against him. Windham and&#10;Allbreath were his favorite writers,&#8212;his favorite artist, Phiz. He&#10;died gloriously while inhaling gas&#8212;levique flatu corrupitur, like&#10;the fama pudicitae in Hieronymus.* He was indubitably a&#34;-&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;* Tenera res in feminis fama pudicitiae, et quasi flos&#10;pulcherrimus, cito ad levem marcessit auram, levique flatu&#10;corrumpitur, maxime, &#38;amp;c.&#8212;Hieronymus ad Salvinam.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;How can you?&#8212;how&#8212;can&#8212;you?&#34;&#8212;interrupted the object of my&#10;animadversions, gasping for breath, and tearing off, with a&#10;desperate exertion, the bandage around its jaws&#8212;&#34;how can you, Mr.&#10;Lackobreath, be so infernally cruel as to pinch me in that manner&#10;by the nose? Did you not see how they had fastened up my mouth&#8212;and&#10;you must know&#8212;if you know any thing&#8212;how vast a superfluity of&#10;breath I have to dispose of! If you do not know, however, sit down&#10;and you shall see. In my situation it is really a great relief to&#10;be able to open ones mouth&#8212;to be able to expatiate&#8212;to be able to&#10;communicate with a person like yourself, who do not think yourself&#10;called upon at every period to interrupt the thread of a&#10;gentleman&#39;s discourse. Interruptions are annoying and should&#10;undoubtedly be abolished&#8212;don&#39;t you think so?&#8212;no reply, I beg&#10;you,&#8212;one person is enough to be speaking at a time.&#8212;I shall be done&#10;by and by, and then you may begin.&#8212;How the devil sir, did you get&#10;into this place?&#8212;not a word I beseech you&#8212;been here some time&#10;myself&#8212;terrible accident!&#8212;heard of it, I suppose?&#8212;awful&#10;calamity!&#8212;walking under your windows&#8212;some short while ago&#8212;about the&#10;time you were stage-struck&#8212;horrible occurrence!&#8212;heard of &#34;catching&#10;one&#39;s breath,&#34; eh?&#8212;hold your tongue I tell you!&#8212;I caught somebody&#10;elses!&#8212;had always too much of my own&#8212;met Blab at the corner of the&#10;street&#8212;wouldn&#39;t give me a chance for a word&#8212;couldn&#39;t get in a&#10;syllable edgeways&#8212;attacked, consequently, with epilepsis&#8212;Blab made&#10;his escape&#8212;damn all fools!&#8212;they took me up for dead, and put me in&#10;this place&#8212;pretty doings all of them!&#8212;heard all you said about&#10;me&#8212;every word a&#10;lie&#8212;horrible!&#8212;wonderful&#8212;outrageous!&#8212;hideous!&#8212;incomprehensible!&#8212;et&#10;cetera&#8212;et cetera&#8212;et cetera&#8212;et cetera&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It is impossible to conceive my astonishment at so unexpected a&#10;discourse, or the joy with which I became gradually convinced that&#10;the breath so fortunately caught by the gentleman (whom I soon&#10;recognized as my neighbor Windenough) was, in fact, the identical&#10;expiration mislaid by myself in the conversation with my wife.&#10;Time, place, and circumstances rendered it a matter beyond&#10;question. I did not at least during the long period in which the&#10;inventor of Lombardy poplars continued to favor me with his&#10;explanations.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In this respect I was actuated by that habitual prudence which&#10;has ever been my predominating trait. I reflected that many&#10;difficulties might still lie in the path of my preservation which&#10;only extreme exertion on my part would be able to surmount. Many&#10;persons, I considered, are prone to estimate commodities in their&#10;possession&#8212;however valueless to the then proprietor&#8212;however&#10;troublesome, or distressing&#8212;in direct ratio with the advantages to&#10;be derived by others from their attainment, or by themselves from&#10;their abandonment. Might not this be the case with Mr. Windenough?&#10;In displaying anxiety for the breath of which he was at present so&#10;willing to get rid, might I not lay myself open to the exactions of&#10;his avarice? There are scoundrels in this world, I remembered with&#10;a sigh, who will not scruple to take unfair opportunities with even&#10;a next door neighbor, and (this remark is from Epictetus) it is&#10;precisely at that time when men are most anxious to throw off the&#10;burden of their own calamities that they feel the least desirous of&#10;relieving them in others.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Upon considerations similar to these, and still retaining my&#10;grasp upon the nose of Mr. W., I accordingly thought proper to&#10;model my reply.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Monster!&#34; I began in a tone of the deepest indignation&#8212;&#34;monster&#10;and double-winded idiot!&#8212;dost thou, whom for thine iniquities it&#10;has pleased heaven to accurse with a two-fold respimtion&#8212;dost thou,&#10;I say, presume to address me in the familiar language of an old&#10;acquaintance?&#8212;&#39;I lie,&#39; forsooth! and &#39;hold my tongue,&#39; to be&#10;sure!&#8212;pretty conversation indeed, to a gentleman with a single&#10;breath!&#8212;all this, too, when I have it in my power to relieve the&#10;calamity under which thou dost so justly suffer&#8212;to curtail the&#10;superfluities of thine unhappy respiration.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Like Brutus, I paused for a reply&#8212;with which, like a tornado,&#10;Mr. Windenough immediately overwhelmed me. Protestation followed&#10;upon protestation, and apology upon apology. There were no terms&#10;with which he was unwilling to comply, and there were none of which&#10;I failed to take the fullest advantage.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Preliminaries being at length arranged, my acquaintance&#10;delivered me the respiration; for which (having carefully examined&#10;it) I gave him afterward a receipt.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I am aware that by many I shall be held to blame for speaking in&#10;a manner so cursory, of a transaction so impalpable. It will be&#10;thought that I should have entered more minutely, into the details&#10;of an occurrence by which&#8212;and this is very true&#8212;much new light&#10;might be thrown upon a highly interesting branch of physical&#10;philosophy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;To all this I am sorry that I cannot reply. A hint is the only&#10;answer which I am permitted to make. There were circumstances&#8212;but I&#10;think it much safer upon consideration to say as little as possible&#10;about an affair so delicate&#8212;so delicate, I repeat, and at the time&#10;involving the interests of a third party whose sulphurous&#10;resentment I have not the least desire, at this moment, of&#10;incurring.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;We were not long after this necessary arrangement in effecting&#10;an escape from the dungeons of the sepulchre. The united strength&#10;of our resuscitated voices was soon sufficiently apparent.&#10;Scissors, the Whig editor, republished a treatise upon &#34;the nature&#10;and origin of subterranean noises.&#34; A&#10;reply&#8212;rejoinder&#8212;confutation&#8212;and justification&#8212;followed in the&#10;columns of a Democratic Gazette. It was not until the opening of&#10;the vault to decide the controversy, that the appearance of Mr.&#10;Windenough and myself proved both parties to have been decidedly in&#10;the wrong.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I cannot conclude these details of some very singular passages&#10;in a life at all times sufficiently eventful, without again&#10;recalling to the attention of the reader the merits of that&#10;indiscriminate philosophy which is a sure and ready shield against&#10;those shafts of calamity which can neither be seen, felt nor fully&#10;understood. It was in the spirit of this wisdom that, among the&#10;ancient Hebrews, it was believed the gates of Heaven would be&#10;inevitably opened to that sinner, or saint, who, with good lungs&#10;and implicit confidence, should vociferate the word &#34;Amen!&#34; It was&#10;in the spirit of this wisdom that, when a great plague raged at&#10;Athens, and every means had been in vain attempted for its removal,&#10;Epimenides, as Laertius relates, in his second book, of that&#10;philosopher, advised the erection of a shrine and temple &#34;to the&#10;proper God.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;LYTTLETON BARRY.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 1, :source => 'feedbooks')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('Metzengerstein'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Pestis eram vivus&#8212;moriens tua mors ero.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Martin Luther&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Horror and fatality have been stalking abroad in all ages. Why&#10;then give a date to this story I have to tell? Let it suffice to&#10;say, that at the period of which I speak, there existed, in the&#10;interior of Hungary, a settled although hidden belief in the&#10;doctrines of the Metempsychosis. Of the doctrines themselves&#8212;that&#10;is, of their falsity, or of their probability&#8212;I say nothing. I&#10;assert, however, that much of our incredulity&#8212;as La Bruyere says of&#10;all our unhappiness&#8212;&#34;vient de ne pouvoir etre seuls.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But there are some points in the Hungarian superstition which&#10;were fast verging to absurdity. They&#8212;the Hungarians&#8212;differed very&#10;essentially from their Eastern authorities. For example, &#34;The&#10;soul,&#34; said the former&#8212;I give the words of an acute and intelligent&#10;Parisian&#8212;&#34;ne demeure qu&#39;un seul fois dans un corps sensible: au&#10;reste&#8212;un cheval, un chien, un homme meme, n&#39;est que la ressemblance&#10;peu tangible de ces animaux.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The families of Berlifitzing and Metzengerstein had been at&#10;variance for centuries. Never before were two houses so&#10;illustrious, mutually embittered by hostility so deadly. Indeed at&#10;the era of this history, it was observed by an old crone of haggard&#10;and sinister appearance, that &#34;fire and water might sooner mingle&#10;than a Berlifitzing clasp the hand of a Metzengerstein.&#34; The origin&#10;of this enmity seems to be found in the words of an ancient&#10;prophecy&#8212;&#34;A lofty name shall have a fearful fall when, as the rider&#10;over his horse, the mortality of Metzengerstein shall triumph over&#10;the immortality of Berlifitzing.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;To be sure the words themselves had little or no meaning. But&#10;more trivial causes have given rise&#8212;and that no long while ago&#8212;to&#10;consequences equally eventful. Besides, the estates, which were&#10;contiguous, had long exercised a rival influence in the affairs of&#10;a busy government. Moreover, near neighbors are seldom friends; and&#10;the inhabitants of the Castle Berlifitzing might look, from their&#10;lofty buttresses, into the very windows of the palace&#10;Metzengerstein. Least of all had the more than feudal magnificence,&#10;thus discovered, a tendency to allay the irritable feelings of the&#10;less ancient and less wealthy Berlifitzings. What wonder then, that&#10;the words, however silly, of that prediction, should have succeeded&#10;in setting and keeping at variance two families already predisposed&#10;to quarrel by every instigation of hereditary jealousy? The&#10;prophecy seemed to imply&#8212;if it implied anything&#8212;a final triumph on&#10;the part of the already more powerful house; and was of course&#10;remembered with the more bitter animosity by the weaker and less&#10;influential.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Wilhelm, Count Berlifitzing, although loftily descended, was, at&#10;the epoch of this narrative, an infirm and doting old man,&#10;remarkable for nothing but an inordinate and inveterate personal&#10;antipathy to the family of his rival, and so passionate a love of&#10;horses, and of hunting, that neither bodily infirmity, great age,&#10;nor mental incapacity, prevented his daily participation in the&#10;dangers of the chase.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Frederick, Baron Metzengerstein, was, on the other hand, not yet&#10;Mary, followed him quickly after. Frederick was, at that time, in&#10;his fifteenth year. In a city, fifteen years are no long period&#8212;a&#10;child may be still a child in his third lustrum: but in a&#10;wilderness&#8212;in so magnificent a wilderness as that old principality,&#10;fifteen years have a far deeper meaning.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The beautiful Lady Mary! How could she die?&#8212;and of consumption!&#10;But it is a path I have prayed to follow. I would wish all I love&#10;to perish of that gentle disease. How glorious&#8212;to depart in the&#10;heyday of the young blood&#8212;the heart of all passion&#8212;the imagination&#10;all fire&#8212;amid the remembrances of happier days&#8212;in the fall of the&#10;year- and so be buried up forever in the gorgeous autumnal&#10;leaves!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Thus died the Lady Mary. The young Baron Frederick stood without&#10;a living relative by the coffin of his dead mother. He placed his&#10;hand upon her placid forehead. No shudder came over his delicate&#10;frame&#8212;no sigh from his flinty bosom. Heartless, self-willed and&#10;impetuous from his childhood, he had reached the age of which I&#10;speak through a career of unfeeling, wanton, and reckless&#10;dissipation; and a barrier had long since arisen in the channel of&#10;all holy thoughts and gentle recollections.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;From some peculiar circumstances attending the administration of&#10;his father, the young Baron, at the decease of the former, entered&#10;immediately upon his vast possessions. Such estates were seldom&#10;held before by a nobleman of Hungary. His castles were without&#10;number. The chief in point of splendor and extent was the &#34;Chateau&#10;Metzengerstein.&#34; The boundary line of his dominions was never&#10;clearly defined; but his principal park embraced a circuit of fifty&#10;miles.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Upon the succession of a proprietor so young, with a character&#10;so well known, to a fortune so unparalleled, little speculation was&#10;afloat in regard to his probable course of conduct. And, indeed,&#10;for the space of three days, the behavior of the heir out-heroded&#10;Herod, and fairly surpassed the expectations of his most&#10;enthusiastic admirers. Shameful debaucheries&#8212;flagrant&#10;treacheries&#8212;unheard-of atrocities&#8212;gave his trembling vassals&#10;quickly to understand that no servile submission on their part&#8212;no&#10;punctilios of conscience on his own&#8212;were thenceforward to prove any&#10;security against the remorseless fangs of a petty Caligula. On the&#10;night of the fourth day, the stables of the castle Berlifitzing&#10;were discovered to be on fire; and the unanimous opinion of the&#10;neighborhood added the crime of the incendiary to the already&#10;hideous list of the Baron&#39;s misdemeanors and enormities.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But during the tumult occasioned by this occurrence, the young&#10;nobleman himself sat apparently buried in meditation, in a vast and&#10;desolate upper apartment of the family palace of Metzengerstein.&#10;The rich although faded tapestry hangings which swung gloomily upon&#10;the walls, represented the shadowy and majestic forms of a thousand&#10;illustrious ancestors. Here, rich-ermined priests, and pontifical&#10;dignitaries, familiarly seated with the autocrat and the sovereign,&#10;put a veto on the wishes of a temporal king, or restrained with the&#10;fiat of papal supremacy the rebellious sceptre of the Arch-enemy.&#10;There, the dark, tall statures of the Princes Metzengerstein&#8212;their&#10;muscular war-coursers plunging over the carcasses of fallan&#10;foes&#8212;startled the steadiest nerves with their vigorous expression;&#10;and here, again, the voluptuous and swan-like figures of the dames&#10;of days gone by, floated away in the mazes of an unreal dance to&#10;the strains of imaginary melody.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But as the Baron listened, or affected to listen, to the&#10;gradually increasing uproar in the stables of Berlifitzing&#8212;or&#10;perhaps pondered upon some more novel, some more decided act of&#10;audacity&#8212;his eyes became unwittingly rivetted to the figure of an&#10;enormous, and unnaturally colored horse, represented in the&#10;tapestry as belonging to a Saracen ancestor of the family of his&#10;rival. The horse itself, in the foreground of the design, stood&#10;motionless and statue-like&#8212;while farther back, its discomfited&#10;rider perished by the dagger of a Metzengerstein.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;On Frederick&#39;s lip arose a fiendish expression, as he became&#10;aware of the direction which his glance had, without his&#10;consciousness, assumed. Yet he did not remove it. On the contrary,&#10;he could by no means account for the overwhelming anxiety which&#10;appeared falling like a pall upon his senses. It was with&#10;difficulty that he reconciled his dreamy and incoherent feelings&#10;with the certainty of being awake. The longer he gazed the more&#10;absorbing became the spell&#8212;the more impossible did it appear that&#10;he could ever withdraw his glance from the fascination of that&#10;tapestry. But the tumult without becoming suddenly more violent,&#10;with a compulsory exertion he diverted his attention to the glare&#10;of ruddy light thrown full by the flaming stables upon the windows&#10;of the apartment.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The action, however, was but momentary, his gaze returned&#10;mechanically to the wall. To his extreme horror and astonishment,&#10;the head of the gigantic steed had, in the meantime, altered its&#10;position. The neck of the animal, before arched, as if in&#10;compassion, over the prostrate body of its lord, was now extended,&#10;at full length, in the direction of the Baron. The eyes, before&#10;invisible, now wore an energetic and human expression, while they&#10;gleamed with a fiery and unusual red; and the distended lips of the&#10;apparently enraged horse left in full view his gigantic and&#10;disgusting teeth.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Stupefied with terror, the young nobleman tottered to the door.&#10;As he threw it open, a flash of red light, streaming far into the&#10;chamber, flung his shadow with a clear outline against the&#10;quivering tapestry, and he shuddered to perceive that shadow&#8212;as he&#10;staggered awhile upon the threshold&#8212;assuming the exact position,&#10;and precisely filling up the contour, of the relentless and&#10;triumphant murderer of the Saracen Berlifitzing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;To lighten the depression of his spirits, the Baron hurried into&#10;the open air. At the principal gate of the palace he encountered&#10;three equerries. With much difficulty, and at the imminent peril of&#10;their lives, they were restraining the convulsive plunges of a&#10;gigantic and fiery-colored horse.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Whose horse? Where did you get him?&#34; demanded the youth, in a&#10;querulous and husky tone of voice, as he became instantly aware&#10;that the mysterious steed in the tapestried chamber was the very&#10;counterpart of the furious animal before his eyes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;He is your own property, sire,&#34; replied one of the equerries,&#10;&#34;at least he is claimed by no other owner. We caught him flying,&#10;all smoking and foaming with rage, from the burning stables of the&#10;Castle Berlifitzing. Supposing him to have belonged to the old&#10;Count&#39;s stud of foreign horses, we led him back as an estray. But&#10;the grooms there disclaim any title to the creature; which is&#10;strange, since he bears evident marks of having made a narrow&#10;escape from the flames.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The letters W. V. B. are also branded very distinctly on his&#10;forehead,&#34; interrupted a second equerry, &#34;I supposed them, of&#10;course, to be the initials of Wilhelm Von Berlifitzing&#8212;but all at&#10;the castle are positive in denying any knowledge of the horse.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Extremely singular!&#34; said the young Baron, with a musing air,&#10;and apparently unconscious of the meaning of his words. &#34;He is, as&#10;you say, a remarkable horse&#8212;a prodigious horse! although, as you&#10;very justly observe, of a suspicious and untractable character, let&#10;him be mine, however,&#34; he added, after a pause, &#34;perhaps a rider&#10;like Frederick of Metzengerstein, may tame even the devil from the&#10;stables of Berlifitzing.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You are mistaken, my lord; the horse, as I think we mentioned,&#10;is not from the stables of the Count. If such had been the case, we&#10;know our duty better than to bring him into the presence of a noble&#10;of your family.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;True!&#34; observed the Baron, dryly, and at that instant a page of&#10;the bedchamber came from the palace with a heightened color, and a&#10;precipitate step. He whispered into his master&#39;s ear an account of&#10;the sudden disappearance of a small portion of the tapestry, in an&#10;apartment which he designated; entering, at the same time, into&#10;particulars of a minute and circumstantial character; but from the&#10;low tone of voice in which these latter were communicated, nothing&#10;escaped to gratify the excited curiosity of the equerries.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The young Frederick, during the conference, seemed agitated by a&#10;variety of emotions. He soon, however, recovered his composure, and&#10;an expression of determined malignancy settled upon his&#10;countenance, as he gave peremptory orders that a certain chamber&#10;should be immediately locked up, and the key placed in his own&#10;possession.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Have you heard of the unhappy death of the old hunter&#10;Berlifitzing?&#34; said one of his vassals to the Baron, as, after the&#10;departure of the page, the huge steed which that nobleman had&#10;adopted as his own, plunged and curvetted, with redoubled fury,&#10;down the long avenue which extended from the chateau to the stables&#10;of Metzengerstein.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No!&#34; said the Baron, turning abruptly toward the speaker,&#10;&#34;dead! say you?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It is indeed true, my lord; and, to a noble of your name, will&#10;be, I imagine, no unwelcome intelligence.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A rapid smile shot over the countenance of the listener. &#34;How&#10;died he?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;In his rash exertions to rescue a favorite portion of his&#10;hunting stud, he has himself perished miserably in the flames.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I-n-d-e-e-d-!&#34; ejaculated the Baron, as if slowly and&#10;deliberately impressed with the truth of some exciting idea.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Indeed;&#34; repeated the vassal.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Shocking!&#34; said the youth, calmly, and turned quietly into the&#10;chateau.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;From this date a marked alteration took place in the outward&#10;demeanor of the dissolute young Baron Frederick Von Metzengerstein.&#10;Indeed, his behavior disappointed every expectation, and proved&#10;little in accordance with the views of many a manoeuvering mamma;&#10;while his habits and manner, still less than formerly, offered any&#10;thing congenial with those of the neighboring aristocracy. He was&#10;never to be seen beyond the limits of his own domain, and, in this&#10;wide and social world, was utterly companionless&#8212;unless, indeed,&#10;that unnatural, impetuous, and fiery-colored horse, which he&#10;henceforward continually bestrode, had any mysterious right to the&#10;title of his friend.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Numerous invitations on the part of the neighborhood for a long&#10;time, however, periodically came in. &#34;Will the Baron honor our&#10;festivals with his presence?&#34; &#34;Will the Baron join us in a hunting&#10;of the boar?&#34;&#8212;&#34;Metzengerstein does not hunt;&#34; &#34;Metzengerstein will&#10;not attend,&#34; were the haughty and laconic answers.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;These repeated insults were not to be endured by an imperious&#10;nobility. Such invitations became less cordial&#8212;less frequent&#8212;in&#10;time they ceased altogether. The widow of the unfortunate Count&#10;Berlifitzing was even heard to express a hope &#34;that the Baron might&#10;be at home when he did not wish to be at home, since he disdained&#10;the company of his equals; and ride when he did not wish to ride,&#10;since he preferred the society of a horse.&#34; This to be sure was a&#10;very silly explosion of hereditary pique; and merely proved how&#10;singularly unmeaning our sayings are apt to become, when we desire&#10;to be unusually energetic.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The charitable, nevertheless, attributed the alteration in the&#10;conduct of the young nobleman to the natural sorrow of a son for&#10;the untimely loss of his parents&#8212;forgetting, however, his atrocious&#10;and reckless behavior during the short period immediately&#10;succeeding that bereavement. Some there were, indeed, who suggested&#10;a too haughty idea of self-consequence and dignity. Others again&#10;(among them may be mentioned the family physician) did not hesitate&#10;in speaking of morbid melancholy, and hereditary ill-health; while&#10;dark hints, of a more equivocal nature, were current among the&#10;multitude.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Indeed, the Baron&#39;s perverse attachment to his lately-acquired&#10;charger&#8212;an attachment which seemed to attain new strength from&#10;every fresh example of the animal&#39;s ferocious and demon-like&#10;propensities- at length became, in the eyes of all reasonable men,&#10;a hideous and unnatural fervor. In the glare of noon&#8212;at the dead&#10;hour of night&#8212;in sickness or in health&#8212;in calm or in tempest&#8212;the&#10;young Metzengerstein seemed rivetted to the saddle of that colossal&#10;horse, whose intractable audacities so well accorded with his own&#10;spirit.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There were circumstances, moreover, which coupled with late&#10;events, gave an unearthly and portentous character to the mania of&#10;the rider, and to the capabilities of the steed. The space passed&#10;over in a single leap had been accurately measured, and was found&#10;to exceed, by an astounding difference, the wildest expectations of&#10;the most imaginative. The Baron, besides, had no particular name&#10;for the animal, although all the rest in his collection were&#10;distinguished by characteristic appellations. His stable, too, was&#10;appointed at a distance from the rest; and with regard to grooming&#10;and other necessary offices, none but the owner in person had&#10;ventured to officiate, or even to enter the enclosure of that&#10;particular stall. It was also to be observed, that although the&#10;three grooms, who had caught the steed as he fled from the&#10;conflagration at Berlifitzing, had succeeded in arresting his&#10;course, by means of a chain-bridle and noose&#8212;yet no one of the&#10;three could with any certainty affirm that he had, during that&#10;dangerous struggle, or at any period thereafter, actually placed&#10;his hand upon the body of the beast. Instances of peculiar&#10;intelligence in the demeanor of a noble and high-spirited horse are&#10;not to be supposed capable of exciting unreasonable&#10;attention&#8212;especially among men who, daily trained to the labors of&#10;the chase, might appear well acquainted with the sagacity of a&#10;horse&#8212;but there were certain circumstances which intruded&#10;themselves per force upon the most skeptical and phlegmatic; and it&#10;is said there were times when the animal caused the gaping crowd&#10;who stood around to recoil in horror from the deep and impressive&#10;meaning of his terrible stamp&#8212;times when the young Metzengerstein&#10;turned pale and shrunk away from the rapid and searching expression&#10;of his earnest and human-looking eye.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Among all the retinue of the Baron, however, none were found to&#10;doubt the ardor of that extraordinary affection which existed on&#10;the part of the young nobleman for the fiery qualities of his&#10;horse; at least, none but an insignificant and misshapen little&#10;page, whose deformities were in everybody&#39;s way, and whose opinions&#10;were of the least possible importance. He&#8212;if his ideas are worth&#10;mentioning at all&#8212;had the effrontery to assert that his master&#10;never vaulted into the saddle without an unaccountable and almost&#10;imperceptible shudder, and that, upon his return from every&#10;long-continued and habitual ride, an expression of triumphant&#10;malignity distorted every muscle in his countenance.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;One tempestuous night, Metzengerstein, awaking from a heavy&#10;slumber, descended like a maniac from his chamber, and, mounting in&#10;hot haste, bounded away into the mazes of the forest. An occurrence&#10;so common attracted no particular attention, but his return was&#10;looked for with intense anxiety on the part of his domestics, when,&#10;after some hours&#39; absence, the stupendous and magnificent&#10;battlements of the Chateau Metzengerstein, were discovered&#10;crackling and rocking to their very foundation, under the influence&#10;of a dense and livid mass of ungovernable fire.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As the flames, when first seen, had already made so terrible a&#10;progress that all efforts to save any portion of the building were&#10;evidently futile, the astonished neighborhood stood idly around in&#10;silent and pathetic wonder. But a new and fearful object soon&#10;rivetted the attention of the multitude, and proved how much more&#10;intense is the excitement wrought in the feelings of a crowd by the&#10;contemplation of human agony, than that brought about by the most&#10;appalling spectacles of inanimate matter.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Up the long avenue of aged oaks which led from the forest to the&#10;main entrance of the Chateau Metzengerstein, a steed, bearing an&#10;unbonneted and disordered rider, was seen leaping with an&#10;impetuosity which outstripped the very Demon of the Tempest, and&#10;extorted from every stupefied beholder the&#10;ejaculation&#8212;&#34;horrible.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The career of the horseman was indisputably, on his own part,&#10;uncontrollable. The agony of his countenance, the convulsive&#10;struggle of his frame, gave evidence of superhuman exertion: but no&#10;sound, save a solitary shriek, escaped from his lacerated lips,&#10;which were bitten through and through in the intensity of terror.&#10;One instant, and the clattering of hoofs resounded sharply and&#10;shrilly above the roaring of the flames and the shrieking of the&#10;winds&#8212;another, and, clearing at a single plunge the gate-way and&#10;the moat, the steed bounded far up the tottering staircases of the&#10;palace, and, with its rider, disappeared amid the whirlwind of&#10;chaotic fire.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The fury of the tempest immediately died away, and a dead calm&#10;sullenly succeeded. A white flame still enveloped the building like&#10;a shroud, and, streaming far away into the quiet atmosphere, shot&#10;forth a glare of preternatural light; while a cloud of smoke&#10;settled heavily over the battlements in the distinct colossal&#10;figure of&#8212;a horse.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 1, :source => 'feedbooks')

The wretchedness of earth is multiform.&#10;Overreaching the wide horizon as the rainbow, its hues are as&#10;various as the hues of that arch,&#8212;as distinct too, yet as&#10;intimately blended. Overreaching the wide horizon as the rainbow!&#10;How is it that from beauty I have derived a type of&#10;unloveliness?&#8212;from the covenant of peace a simile of sorrow? But&#10;as, in ethics, evil is a consequence of good, so, in fact, out of&#10;joy is sorrow born. Either the memory of past bliss is the anguish&#10;of to-day, or the agonies which are have their origin in the&#10;ecstasies which might have been.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;My baptismal name is Egaeus; that of my family I will not&#10;mention. Yet there are no towers in the land more time-honored than&#10;my gloomy, gray, hereditary halls. Our line has been called a race&#10;of visionaries; and in many striking particulars&#8212;in the character&#10;of the family mansion&#8212;in the frescos of the chief saloon&#8212;in the&#10;tapestries of the dormitories&#8212;in the chiselling of some buttresses&#10;in the armory&#8212;but more especially in the gallery of antique&#10;paintings&#8212;in the fashion of the library chamber&#8212;and, lastly, in the&#10;very peculiar nature of the library&#39;s contents, there is more than&#10;sufficient evidence to warrant the belief.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The recollections of my earliest years are connected with that&#10;chamber, and with its volumes&#8212;of which latter I will say no more.&#10;Here died my mother. Herein was I born. But it is mere idleness to&#10;say that I had not lived before&#8212;that the soul has no previous&#10;existence. You deny it?&#8212;let us not argue the matter. Convinced&#10;myself, I seek not to convince. There is, however, a remembrance of&#10;aerial forms&#8212;of spiritual and meaning eyes&#8212;of sounds, musical yet&#10;sad&#8212;a remembrance which will not be excluded; a memory like a&#10;shadow, vague, variable, indefinite, unsteady; and like a shadow,&#10;too, in the impossibility of my getting rid of it while the&#10;sunlight of my reason shall exist.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In that chamber was I born. Thus awaking from the long night of&#10;what seemed, but was not, nonentity, at once into the very regions&#10;of fairy-land&#8212;into a palace of imagination&#8212;into the wild dominions&#10;of monastic thought and erudition&#8212;it is not singular that I gazed&#10;around me with a startled and ardent eye&#8212;that I loitered away my&#10;boyhood in books, and dissipated my youth in reverie; but it is&#10;singular that as years rolled away, and the noon of manhood found&#10;me still in the mansion of my fathers&#8212;it is wonderful what&#10;stagnation there fell upon the springs of my life&#8212;wonderful how&#10;total an inversion took place in the character of my commonest&#10;thought. The realities of the world affected me as visions, and as&#10;visions only, while the wild ideas of the land of dreams became, in&#10;turn,&#8212;not the material of my every-day existence-but in very deed&#10;that existence utterly and solely in itself.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Berenice and I were cousins, and we grew up together in my&#10;paternal halls. Yet differently we grew&#8212;I ill of health, and buried&#10;in gloom&#8212;she agile, graceful, and overflowing with energy; hers the&#10;ramble on the hill-side&#8212;mine the studies of the cloister&#8212;I living&#10;within my own heart, and addicted body and soul to the most intense&#10;and painful meditation&#8212;she roaming carelessly through life with no&#10;thought of the shadows in her path, or the silent flight of the&#10;raven-winged hours. Berenice!&#8212;I call upon her name&#8212;Berenice!&#8212;and&#10;from the gray ruins of memory a thousand tumultuous recollections&#10;are startled at the sound! Ah! vividly is her image before me now,&#10;as in the early days of her light-heartedness and joy! Oh! gorgeous&#10;yet fantastic beauty! Oh! sylph amid the shrubberies of&#10;Arnheim!&#8212;Oh! Naiad among its fountains!&#8212;and then&#8212;then all is&#10;mystery and terror, and a tale which should not be told. Disease&#8212;a&#10;fatal disease&#8212;fell like the simoom upon her frame, and, even while&#10;I gazed upon her, the spirit of change swept, over her, pervading&#10;her mind, her habits, and her character, and, in a manner the most&#10;subtle and terrible, disturbing even the identity of her person!&#10;Alas! the destroyer came and went, and the victim&#8212;where was she, I&#10;knew her not&#8212;or knew her no longer as Berenice.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Among the numerous train of maladies superinduced by that fatal&#10;and primary one which effected a revolution of so horrible a kind&#10;in the moral and physical being of my cousin, may be mentioned as&#10;the most distressing and obstinate in its nature, a species of&#10;epilepsy not unfrequently terminating in trance itself&#8212;trance very&#10;nearly resembling positive dissolution, and from which her manner&#10;of recovery was in most instances, startlingly abrupt. In the mean&#10;time my own disease&#8212;for I have been told that I should call it by&#10;no other appelation&#8212;my own disease, then, grew rapidly upon me, and&#10;assumed finally a monomaniac character of a novel and extraordinary&#10;form&#8212;hourly and momently gaining vigor&#8212;and at length obtaining over&#10;me the most incomprehensible ascendancy. This monomania, if I must&#10;so term it, consisted in a morbid irritability of those properties&#10;of the mind in metaphysical science termed the attentive. It is&#10;more than probable that I am not understood; but I fear, indeed,&#10;that it is in no manner possible to convey to the mind of the&#10;merely general reader, an adequate idea of that nervous intensity&#10;of interest with which, in my case, the powers of meditation (not&#10;to speak technically) busied and buried themselves, in the&#10;contemplation of even the most ordinary objects of the&#10;universe.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;To muse for long unwearied hours with my attention riveted to&#10;some frivolous device on the margin, or in the topography of a&#10;book; to become absorbed for the better part of a summer&#39;s day, in&#10;a quaint shadow falling aslant upon the tapestry, or upon the door;&#10;to lose myself for an entire night in watching the steady flame of&#10;a lamp, or the embers of a fire; to dream away whole days over the&#10;perfume of a flower; to repeat monotonously some common word, until&#10;the sound, by dint of frequent repetition, ceased to convey any&#10;idea whatever to the mind; to lose all sense of motion or physical&#10;existence, by means of absolute bodily quiescence long and&#10;obstinately persevered in;&#8212;such were a few of the most common and&#10;least pernicious vagaries induced by a condition of the mental&#10;faculties, not, indeed, altogether unparalleled, but certainly&#10;bidding defiance to anything like analysis or explanation.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Yet let me not be misapprehended.&#8212;The undue, earnest, and morbid&#10;attention thus excited by objects in their own nature frivolous,&#10;must not be confounded in character with that ruminating propensity&#10;common to all mankind, and more especially indulged in by persons&#10;of ardent imagination. It was not even, as might be at first&#10;supposed, an extreme condition or exaggeration of such propensity,&#10;but primarily and essentially distinct and different. In the one&#10;instance, the dreamer, or enthusiast, being interested by an object&#10;usually not frivolous, imperceptibly loses sight of this object in&#10;a wilderness of deductions and suggestions issuing therefrom,&#10;until, at the conclusion of a day dream often replete with luxury,&#10;he finds the incitamentum or first cause of his musings entirely&#10;vanished and forgotten. In my case the primary object was&#10;invariably frivolous, although assuming, through the medium of my&#10;distempered vision, a refracted and unreal importance. Few&#10;deductions, if any, were made; and those few pertinaciously&#10;returning in upon the original object as a centre. The meditations&#10;were never pleasurable; and, at the termination of the reverie, the&#10;first cause, so far from being out of sight, had attained that&#10;supernaturally exaggerated interest which was the prevailing&#10;feature of the disease. In a word, the powers of mind more&#10;particularly exercised were, with me, as I have said before, the&#10;attentive, and are, with the day-dreamer, the speculative.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;My books, at this epoch, if they did not actually serve to&#10;irritate the disorder, partook, it will be perceived, largely, in&#10;their imaginative and inconsequential nature, of the characteristic&#10;qualities of the disorder itself. I well remember, among others,&#10;the treatise of the noble Italian Coelius Secundus Curio &#34;de&#10;Amplitudine Beati Regni dei&#34;; St. Austin&#39;s great work, the &#34;City of&#10;God&#34;; and Tertullian &#34;de Carne Christi,&#34; in which the paradoxical&#10;sentence &#34;Mortuus est Dei filius; credible est quia ineptum est: et&#10;sepultus resurrexit; certum est quia impossibile est&#34; occupied my&#10;undivided time, for many weeks of laborious and fruitless&#10;investigation.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Thus it will appear that, shaken from its balance only by&#10;trivial things, my reason bore resemblance to that ocean-crag&#10;spoken of by Ptolemy Hephestion, which steadily resisting the&#10;attacks of human violence, and the fiercer fury of the waters and&#10;the winds, trembled only to the touch of the flower called&#10;Asphodel. And although, to a careless thinker, it might appear a&#10;matter beyond doubt, that the alteration produced by her unhappy&#10;malady, in the moral condition of Berenice, would afford me many&#10;objects for the exercise of that intense and abnormal meditation&#10;whose nature I have been at some trouble in explaining, yet such&#10;was not in any degree the case. In the lucid intervals of my&#10;infirmity, her calamity, indeed, gave me pain, and, taking deeply&#10;to heart that total wreck of her fair and gentle life, I did not&#10;fall to ponder frequently and bitterly upon the wonder-working&#10;means by which so strange a revolution had been so suddenly brought&#10;to pass. But these reflections partook not of the idiosyncrasy of&#10;my disease, and were such as would have occurred, under similar&#10;circumstances, to the ordinary mass of mankind. True to its own&#10;character, my disorder revelled in the less important but more&#10;startling changes wrought in the physical frame of Berenice&#8212;in the&#10;singular and most appalling distortion of her personal&#10;identity.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;During the brightest days of her unparalleled beauty, most&#10;surely I had never loved her. In the strange anomaly of my&#10;existence, feelings with me, had never been of the heart, and my&#10;passions always were of the mind. Through the gray of the early&#10;morning&#8212;among the trellissed shadows of the forest at noonday&#8212;and&#10;in the silence of my library at night, she had flitted by my eyes,&#10;and I had seen her&#8212;not as the living and breathing Berenice, but as&#10;the Berenice of a dream&#8212;not as a being of the earth, earthy, but as&#10;the abstraction of such a being-not as a thing to admire, but to&#10;analyze&#8212;not as an object of love, but as the theme of the most&#10;abstruse although desultory speculation. And now&#8212;now I shuddered in&#10;her presence, and grew pale at her approach; yet bitterly lamenting&#10;her fallen and desolate condition, I called to mind that she had&#10;loved me long, and, in an evil moment, I spoke to her of&#10;marriage.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And at length the period of our nuptials was approaching, when,&#10;upon an afternoon in the winter of the year,&#8212;one of those&#10;unseasonably warm, calm, and misty days which are the nurse of the&#10;beautiful Halcyon*,&#8212;I sat, (and sat, as I thought, alone,) in the&#10;inner apartment of the library. But uplifting my eyes I saw that&#10;Berenice stood before me.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;* For as Jove, during the winter season, gives twice seven days&#10;of warmth, men have called this clement and temperate time the&#10;nurse of the beautiful Halcyon&#8212;Simonides.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Was it my own excited imagination&#8212;or the misty influence of the&#10;atmosphere&#8212;or the uncertain twilight of the chamber&#8212;or the gray&#10;draperies which fell around her figure&#8212;that caused in it so&#10;vacillating and indistinct an outline? I could not tell. She spoke&#10;no word, I&#8212;not for worlds could I have uttered a syllable. An icy&#10;chill ran through my frame; a sense of insufferable anxiety&#10;oppressed me; a consuming curiosity pervaded my soul; and sinking&#10;back upon the chair, I remained for some time breathless and&#10;motionless, with my eyes riveted upon her person. Alas! its&#10;emaciation was excessive, and not one vestige of the former being,&#10;lurked in any single line of the contour. My burning glances at&#10;length fell upon the face.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The forehead was high, and very pale, and singularly placid; and&#10;the once jetty hair fell partially over it, and overshadowed the&#10;hollow temples with innumerable ringlets now of a vivid yellow, and&#10;Jarring discordantly, in their fantastic character, with the&#10;reigning melancholy of the countenance. The eyes were lifeless, and&#10;lustreless, and seemingly pupil-less, and I shrank involuntarily&#10;from their glassy stare to the contemplation of the thin and&#10;shrunken lips. They parted; and in a smile of peculiar meaning, the&#10;teeth of the changed Berenice disclosed themselves slowly to my&#10;view. Would to God that I had never beheld them, or that, having&#10;done so, I had died!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The shutting of a door disturbed me, and, looking up, I found&#10;that my cousin had departed from the chamber. But from the&#10;disordered chamber of my brain, had not, alas! departed, and would&#10;not be driven away, the white and ghastly spectrum of the teeth.&#10;Not a speck on their surface&#8212;not a shade on their enamel&#8212;not an&#10;indenture in their edges&#8212;but what that period of her smile had&#10;sufficed to brand in upon my memory. I saw them now even more&#10;unequivocally than I beheld them then. The teeth!&#8212;the teeth!&#8212;they&#10;were here, and there, and everywhere, and visibly and palpably&#10;before me; long, narrow, and excessively white, with the pale lips&#10;writhing about them, as in the very moment of their first terrible&#10;development. Then came the full fury of my monomania, and I&#10;struggled in vain against its strange and irresistible influence.&#10;In the multiplied objects of the external world I had no thoughts&#10;but for the teeth. For these I longed with a phrenzied desire. All&#10;other matters and all different interests became absorbed in their&#10;single contemplation. They&#8212;they alone were present to the mental&#10;eye, and they, in their sole individuality, became the essence of&#10;my mental life. I held them in every light. I turned them in every&#10;attitude. I surveyed their characteristics. I dwelt upon their&#10;peculiarities. I pondered upon their conformation. I mused upon the&#10;alteration in their nature. I shuddered as I assigned to them in&#10;imagination a sensitive and sentient power, and even when&#10;unassisted by the lips, a capability of moral expression. Of&#10;Mad&#39;selle Salle it has been well said, &#34;que tous ses pas etaient&#10;des sentiments,&#34; and of Berenice I more seriously believed que&#10;toutes ses dents etaient des idees. Des idees!&#8212;ah here was the&#10;idiotic thought that destroyed me! Des idees!&#8212;ah therefore it was&#10;that I coveted them so madly! I felt that their possession could&#10;alone ever restore me to peace, in giving me back to reason.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And the evening closed in upon me thus-and then the darkness&#10;came, and tarried, and went&#8212;and the day again dawned&#8212;and the mists&#10;of a second night were now gathering around&#8212;and still I sat&#10;motionless in that solitary room; and still I sat buried in&#10;meditation, and still the phantasma of the teeth maintained its&#10;terrible ascendancy as, with the most vivid hideous distinctness,&#10;it floated about amid the changing lights and shadows of the&#10;chamber. At length there broke in upon my dreams a cry as of horror&#10;and dismay; and thereunto, after a pause, succeeded the sound of&#10;troubled voices, intermingled with many low moanings of sorrow, or&#10;of pain. I arose from my seat and, throwing open one of the doors&#10;of the library, saw standing out in the antechamber a servant&#10;maiden, all in tears, who told me that Berenice was&#8212;no more. She&#10;had been seized with epilepsy in the early morning, and now, at the&#10;closing in of the night, the grave was ready for its tenant, and&#10;all the preparations for the burial were completed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I found myself sitting in the library, and again sitting there&#10;alone. It seemed that I had newly awakened from a confused and&#10;exciting dream. I knew that it was now midnight, and I was well&#10;aware that since the setting of the sun Berenice had been interred.&#10;But of that dreary period which intervened I had no positive&#8212;at&#10;least no definite comprehension. Yet its memory was replete with&#10;horror&#8212;horror more horrible from being vague, and terror more&#10;terrible from ambiguity. It was a fearful page in the record my&#10;existence, written all over with dim, and hideous, and&#10;unintelligible recollections. I strived to decypher them, but in&#10;vain; while ever and anon, like the spirit of a departed sound, the&#10;shrill and piercing shriek of a female voice seemed to be ringing&#10;in my ears. I had done a deed&#8212;what was it? I asked myself the&#10;question aloud, and the whispering echoes of the chamber answered&#10;me, &#34;what was it?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;On the table beside me burned a lamp, and near it lay a little&#10;box. It was of no remarkable character, and I had seen it&#10;frequently before, for it was the property of the family physician;&#10;but how came it there, upon my table, and why did I shudder in&#10;regarding it? These things were in no manner to be accounted for,&#10;and my eyes at length dropped to the open pages of a book, and to a&#10;sentence underscored therein. The words were the singular but&#10;simple ones of the poet Ebn Zaiat, &#34;Dicebant mihi sodales si&#10;sepulchrum amicae visitarem, curas meas aliquantulum fore levatas.&#34;&#10;Why then, as I perused them, did the hairs of my head erect&#10;themselves on end, and the blood of my body become congealed within&#10;my veins?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There came a light tap at the library door, and pale as the&#10;tenant of a tomb, a menial entered upon tiptoe. His looks were wild&#10;with terror, and he spoke to me in a voice tremulous, husky, and&#10;very low. What said he?&#8212;some broken sentences I heard. He told of a&#10;wild cry disturbing the silence of the night&#8212;of the gathering&#10;together of the household-of a search in the direction of the&#10;sound;&#8212;and then his tones grew thrillingly distinct as he whispered&#10;me of a violated grave&#8212;of a disfigured body enshrouded, yet still&#10;breathing, still palpitating, still alive!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He pointed to garments;&#8212;they were muddy and clotted with gore. I&#10;spoke not, and he took me gently by the hand;&#8212;it was indented with&#10;the impress of human nails. He directed my attention to some object&#10;against the wall;&#8212;I looked at it for some minutes;&#8212;it was a spade.&#10;With a shriek I bounded to the table, and grasped the box that lay&#10;upon it. But I could not force it open; and in my tremor it slipped&#10;from my hands, and fell heavily, and burst into pieces; and from&#10;it, with a rattling sound, there rolled out some instruments of&#10;dental surgery, intermingled with thirty-two small, white and&#10;ivory-looking substances that were scattered to and fro about the&#10;floor.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 1, :source => 'feedbooks')

And fait that same is no wonder at all at all (so be plased&#10;to stop curlin your nose), for every inch o&#39; the six wakes that&#10;I&#39;ve been a gintleman, and left aff wid the bogthrothing to take up&#10;wid the Barronissy, it&#39;s Pathrick that&#39;s been living like a houly&#10;imperor, and gitting the iddication and the graces.

But it&#39;s the illigant big figgur&#10;that I ave, for the rason o&#39; which all the ladies fall in love wid&#10;me. Isn&#39;t it my own swate silf now that&#39;ll missure the six fut, and&#10;the three inches more nor that, in me stockins, and that am&#10;excadingly will proportioned all over to match? And it is ralelly&#10;more than three fut and a bit that there is, inny how, of the&#10;little ould furrener Frinchman that lives jist over the way, and&#10;that&#39;s a oggling and a goggling the houl day, (and bad luck to&#10;him,) at the purty widdy Misthress Tracle that&#39;s my own nixt-door&#10;neighbor, (God bliss her!) and a most particuller frind and&#10;acquaintance? You percave the little spalpeen is summat down in the&#10;mouth, and wears his lift hand in a sling, and it&#39;s for that same&#10;thing, by yur lave, that I&#39;m going to give you the good rason.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The truth of the houl matter is jist simple enough; for the very&#10;first day that I com&#39;d from Connaught, and showd my swate little&#10;silf in the strait to the widdy, who was looking through the windy,&#10;it was a gone case althegither with the heart o&#39; the purty&#10;Misthress Tracle. I percaved it, ye see, all at once, and no&#10;mistake, and that&#39;s God&#39;s truth. First of all it was up wid the&#10;windy in a jiffy, and thin she threw open her two peepers to the&#10;itmost, and thin it was a little gould spy-glass that she clapped&#10;tight to one o&#39; them and divil may burn me if it didn&#39;t spake to me&#10;as plain as a peeper cud spake, and says it, through the spy-glass:&#10;&#34;Och! the tip o&#39; the mornin&#39; to ye, Sir Pathrick O&#39;Grandison,&#10;Barronitt, mavourneen; and it&#39;s a nate gintleman that ye are, sure&#10;enough, and it&#39;s mesilf and me forten jist that&#39;ll be at yur&#10;sarvice, dear, inny time o&#39; day at all at all for the asking.&#34; And&#10;it&#39;s not mesilf ye wud have to be bate in the purliteness; so I&#10;made her a bow that wud ha&#39; broken yur heart altegither to behould,&#10;and thin I pulled aff me hat with a flourish, and thin I winked at&#10;her hard wid both eyes, as much as to say, &#34;True for you, yer a&#10;swate little crature, Mrs. Tracle, me darlint, and I wish I may be&#10;drownthed dead in a bog, if it&#39;s not mesilf, Sir Pathrick&#10;O&#39;Grandison, Barronitt, that&#39;ll make a houl bushel o&#39; love to yur&#10;leddyship, in the twinkling o&#39; the eye of a Londonderry&#10;purraty.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And it was the nixt mornin&#39;, sure, jist as I was making up me&#10;mind whither it wouldn&#39;t be the purlite thing to sind a bit o&#39;&#10;writin&#39; to the widdy by way of a love-litter, when up com&#39;d the&#10;delivery servant wid an illigant card, and he tould me that the&#10;name on it (for I niver could rade the copperplate printin on&#10;account of being lift handed) was all about Mounseer, the Count, A&#10;Goose, Look&#8212;aisy, Maiter-di-dauns, and that the houl of the&#10;divilish lingo was the spalpeeny long name of the little ould&#10;furrener Frinchman as lived over the way.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And jist wid that in cum&#39;d the little willian himself, and then&#10;he made me a broth of a bow, and thin he said he had ounly taken&#10;the liberty of doing me the honor of the giving me a call, and thin&#10;he went on to palaver at a great rate, and divil the bit did I&#10;comprehind what he wud be afther the tilling me at all at all,&#10;excipting and saving that he said &#34;pully wou, woolly wou,&#34; and&#10;tould me, among a bushel o&#39; lies, bad luck to him, that he was mad&#10;for the love o&#39; my widdy Misthress Tracle, and that my widdy Mrs.&#10;Tracle had a puncheon for him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At the hearin&#39; of this, ye may swear, though, I was as mad as a&#10;grasshopper, but I remimbered that I was Sir Pathrick O&#39;Grandison,&#10;Barronitt, and that it wasn&#39;t althegither gentaal to lit the anger&#10;git the upper hand o&#39; the purliteness, so I made light o&#39; the&#10;matter and kipt dark, and got quite sociable wid the little chap,&#10;and afther a while what did he do but ask me to go wid him to the&#10;widdy&#39;s, saying he wud give me the feshionable inthroduction to her&#10;leddyship.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Is it there ye are?&#34; said I thin to mesilf, &#34;and it&#39;s thrue for&#10;you, Pathrick, that ye&#39;re the fortunittest mortal in life. We&#39;ll&#10;soon see now whither it&#39;s your swate silf, or whither it&#39;s little&#10;Mounseer Maiter-di-dauns, that Misthress Tracle is head and ears in&#10;the love wid.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Wid that we wint aff to the widdy&#39;s, next door, and ye may well&#10;say it was an illigant place; so it was. There was a carpet all&#10;over the floor, and in one corner there was a forty-pinny and a&#10;Jew&#39;s harp and the divil knows what ilse, and in another corner was&#10;a sofy, the beautifullest thing in all natur, and sitting on the&#10;sofy, sure enough, there was the swate little angel, Misthress&#10;Tracle.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The tip o&#39; the mornin&#39; to ye,&#34; says I, &#34;Mrs. Tracle,&#34; and thin&#10;I made sich an illigant obaysance that it wud ha quite althegither&#10;bewildered the brain o&#39; ye.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Wully woo, pully woo, plump in the mud,&#34; says the little&#10;furrenner Frinchman, &#34;and sure Mrs. Tracle,&#34; says he, that he did,&#10;&#34;isn&#39;t this gintleman here jist his reverence Sir Pathrick&#10;O&#39;Grandison, Barronitt, and isn&#39;t he althegither and entirely the&#10;most particular frind and acquaintance that I have in the houl&#10;world?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And wid that the widdy, she gits up from the sofy, and makes the&#10;swatest curthchy nor iver was seen; and thin down she sits like an&#10;angel; and thin, by the powers, it was that little spalpeen&#10;Mounseer Maiter-di-dauns that plumped his silf right down by the&#10;right side of her. Och hon! I ixpicted the two eyes o&#39; me wud ha&#10;cum&#39;d out of my head on the spot, I was so dispirate mad! Howiver,&#10;&#34;Bait who!&#34; says I, after awhile. &#34;Is it there ye are, Mounseer&#10;Maiter-di-dauns?&#34; and so down I plumped on the lift side of her&#10;leddyship, to be aven with the willain. Botheration! it wud ha done&#10;your heart good to percave the illigant double wink that I gived&#10;her jist thin right in the face with both eyes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But the little ould Frinchman he niver beginned to suspict me at&#10;all at all, and disperate hard it was he made the love to her&#10;leddyship. &#34;Woully wou,&#34; says he, Pully wou,&#34; says he, &#34;Plump in&#10;the mud,&#34; says he.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That&#39;s all to no use, Mounseer Frog, mavourneen,&#34; thinks I; and&#10;I talked as hard and as fast as I could all the while, and throth&#10;it was mesilf jist that divarted her leddyship complately and&#10;intirely, by rason of the illigant conversation that I kipt up wid&#10;her all about the dear bogs of Connaught. And by and by she gived&#10;me such a swate smile, from one ind of her mouth to the ither, that&#10;it made me as bould as a pig, and I jist took hould of the ind of&#10;her little finger in the most dillikitest manner in natur, looking&#10;at her all the while out o&#39; the whites of my eyes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And then ounly percave the cuteness of the swate angel, for no&#10;sooner did she obsarve that I was afther the squazing of her&#10;flipper, than she up wid it in a jiffy, and put it away behind her&#10;back, jist as much as to say, &#34;Now thin, Sir Pathrick O&#39;Grandison,&#10;there&#39;s a bitther chance for ye, mavourneen, for it&#39;s not&#10;altogether the gentaal thing to be afther the squazing of my&#10;flipper right full in the sight of that little furrenner Frinchman,&#10;Mounseer Maiter-di-dauns.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Wid that I giv&#39;d her a big wink jist to say, &#34;lit Sir Pathrick&#10;alone for the likes o&#39; them thricks,&#34; and thin I wint aisy to work,&#10;and you&#39;d have died wid the divarsion to behould how cliverly I&#10;slipped my right arm betwane the back o&#39; the sofy, and the back of&#10;her leddyship, and there, sure enough, I found a swate little&#10;flipper all a waiting to say, &#34;the tip o&#39; the mornin&#39; to ye, Sir&#10;Pathrick O&#39;Grandison, Barronitt.&#34; And wasn&#39;t it mesilf, sure, that&#10;jist giv&#39;d it the laste little bit of a squaze in the world, all in&#10;the way of a commincement, and not to be too rough wid her&#10;leddyship? and och, botheration, wasn&#39;t it the gentaalest and&#10;dilikittest of all the little squazes that I got in return? &#34;Blood&#10;and thunder, Sir Pathrick, mavourneen,&#34; thinks I to mesilf, &#34;fait&#10;it&#39;s jist the mother&#39;s son of you, and nobody else at all at all,&#10;that&#39;s the handsomest and the fortunittest young bog-throtter that&#10;ever cum&#39;d out of Connaught!&#34; And with that I givd the flipper a&#10;big squaze, and a big squaze it was, by the powers, that her&#10;leddyship giv&#39;d to me back. But it would ha split the seven sides&#10;of you wid the laffin&#39; to behould, jist then all at once, the&#10;consated behavior of Mounseer Maiter-di-dauns. The likes o&#39; sich a&#10;jabbering, and a smirking, and a parley-wouing as he begin&#39;d wid&#10;her leddyship, niver was known before upon arth; and divil may burn&#10;me if it wasn&#39;t me own very two peepers that cotch&#39;d him tipping&#10;her the wink out of one eye. Och, hon! if it wasn&#39;t mesilf thin&#10;that was mad as a Kilkenny cat I shud like to be tould who it&#10;was!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Let me infarm you, Mounseer Maiter-di-dauns,&#34; said I, as&#10;purlite as iver ye seed, &#34;that it&#39;s not the gintaal thing at all at&#10;all, and not for the likes o&#39; you inny how, to be afther the&#10;oggling and a goggling at her leddyship in that fashion,&#34; and jist&#10;wid that such another squaze as it was I giv&#39;d her flipper, all as&#10;much as to say, &#34;isn&#39;t it Sir Pathrick now, my jewel, that&#39;ll be&#10;able to the proticting o&#39; you, my darlint?&#34; and then there cum&#39;d&#10;another squaze back, all by way of the answer. &#34;Thrue for you, Sir&#10;Pathrick,&#34; it said as plain as iver a squaze said in the world,&#10;&#34;Thrue for you, Sir Pathrick, mavourneen, and it&#39;s a proper nate&#10;gintleman ye are- that&#39;s God&#39;s truth,&#34; and with that she opened her&#10;two beautiful peepers till I belaved they wud ha&#39; cum&#39;d out of her&#10;hid althegither and intirely, and she looked first as mad as a cat&#10;at Mounseer Frog, and thin as smiling as all out o&#39; doors at&#10;mesilf.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Thin,&#34; says he, the willian, &#34;Och hon! and a wolly-wou,&#10;pully-wou,&#34; and then wid that he shoved up his two shoulders till&#10;the divil the bit of his hid was to be diskivered, and then he let&#10;down the two corners of his purraty-trap, and thin not a haporth&#10;more of the satisfaction could I git out o&#39; the spalpeen.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Belave me, my jewel, it was Sir Pathrick that was unreasonable&#10;mad thin, and the more by token that the Frinchman kipt an wid his&#10;winking at the widdy; and the widdy she kept an wid the squazing of&#10;my flipper, as much as to say, &#34;At him again, Sir Pathrick&#10;O&#39;Grandison, mavourneen:&#34; so I just ripped out wid a big oath, and&#10;says I;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ye little spalpeeny frog of a bog-throtting son of a bloody&#10;noun!&#34;- and jist thin what d&#39;ye think it was that her leddyship&#10;did? Troth she jumped up from the sofy as if she was bit, and made&#10;off through the door, while I turned my head round afther her, in a&#10;complate bewilderment and botheration, and followed her wid me two&#10;peepers. You percave I had a reason of my own for knowing that she&#10;couldn&#39;t git down the stares althegither and intirely; for I knew&#10;very well that I had hould of her hand, for the divil the bit had I&#10;iver lit it go. And says I; &#34;Isn&#39;t it the laste little bit of a&#10;mistake in the world that ye&#39;ve been afther the making, yer&#10;leddyship? Come back now, that&#39;s a darlint, and I&#39;ll give ye yur&#10;flipper.&#34; But aff she wint down the stairs like a shot, and thin I&#10;turned round to the little Frinch furrenner. Och hon! if it wasn&#39;t&#10;his spalpeeny little paw that I had hould of in my own&#8212;why&#10;thin&#8212;thin it wasn&#39;t&#8212;that&#39;s all.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And maybe it wasn&#39;t mesilf that jist died then outright wid the&#10;laffin&#39;, to behold the little chap when he found out that it wasn&#39;t&#10;the widdy at all at all that he had had hould of all the time, but&#10;only Sir Pathrick O&#39;Grandison. The ould divil himself niver behild&#10;sich a long face as he pet an! As for Sir Pathrick O&#39;Grandison,&#10;Barronitt, it wasn&#39;t for the likes of his riverence to be afther&#10;the minding of a thrifle of a mistake. Ye may jist say, though (for&#10;it&#39;s God&#39;s thruth), that afore I left hould of the flipper of the&#10;spalpeen (which was not till afther her leddyship&#39;s futman had&#10;kicked us both down the stairs, I giv&#39;d it such a nate little broth&#10;of a squaze as made it all up into raspberry jam.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Woully wou,&#34; says he, &#34;pully wou,&#34; says he&#8212;&#34;Cot tam!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And that&#39;s jist the thruth of the rason why he wears his lift&#10;hand in a sling.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;LITTLETON BARRY.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 1, :source => 'feedbooks')

Why do you call me Eiros?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;CHARMION. So henceforth will you always be called. You must&#10;forget, too, my earthly name, and speak to me as Charmion.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;EIROS. This is indeed no dream!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;CHARMION. Dreams are with us no more; but of these mysteries&#10;anon. I rejoice to see you looking like-life and rational. The film&#10;of the shadow has already passed from off your eyes. Be of heart&#10;and fear nothing. Your allotted days of stupor have expired; and,&#10;to-morrow, I will myself induct you into the full joys and wonders&#10;of your novel existence.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;EIROS. True, I feel no stupor, none at all. The wild sickness&#10;and the terrible darkness have left me, and I hear no longer that&#10;mad, rushing, horrible sound, like the &#34;voice of many waters.&#34; Yet&#10;my senses are bewildered, Charmion, with the keenness of their&#10;perception of the new.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;CHARMION. A few days will remove all this;&#8212;but I fully&#10;understand you, and feel for you. It is now ten earthly years since&#10;I underwent what you undergo, yet the remembrance of it hangs by me&#10;still. You have now suffered all of pain, however, which you will&#10;suffer in Aidenn.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;EIROS. In Aidenn?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;CHARMION. In Aidenn.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;EIROS. Oh, God!&#8212;pity me, Charmion!&#8212;I am overburthened with the&#10;majesty of all things&#8212;of the unknown now known&#8212;of the speculative&#10;Future merged in the august and certain Present.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;CHARMION. Grapple not now with such thoughts. Tomorrow we will&#10;speak of this. Your mind wavers, and its agitation will find relief&#10;in the exercise of simple memories. Look not around, nor&#10;forward&#8212;but back. I am burning with anxiety to hear the details of&#10;that stupendous event which threw you among us. Tell me of it. Let&#10;us converse of familiar things, in the old familiar language of the&#10;world which has so fearfully perished.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;EIROS. Most fearfully, fearfully!&#8212;this is indeed no dream.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;CHARMION. Dreams are no more. Was I much mourned, my Eiros?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;EIROS. Mourned, Charmion?&#8212;oh deeply. To that last hour of all,&#10;there hung a cloud of intense gloom and devout sorrow over your&#10;household.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;CHARMION. And that last hour&#8212;speak of it. Remember that, beyond&#10;the naked fact of the catastrophe itself, I know nothing. When,&#10;coming out from among mankind, I passed into Night through the&#10;Grave&#8212;at that period, if I remember aright, the calamity which&#10;overwhelmed you was utterly unanticipated. But, indeed, I knew&#10;little of the speculative philosophy of the day.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;EIROS. The individual calamity was, as you say, entirely&#10;unanticipated; but analogous misfortunes had been long a subject of&#10;discussion with astronomers. I need scarce tell you, my friend,&#10;that, even when you left us, men had agreed to understand those&#10;passages in the most holy writings which speak of the final&#10;destruction of all things by fire, as having reference to the orb&#10;of the earth alone. But in regard to the immediate agency of the&#10;ruin, speculation had been at fault from that epoch in astronomical&#10;knowledge in which the comets were divested of the terrors of&#10;flame. The very moderate density of these bodies had been well&#10;established. They had been observed to pass among the satellites of&#10;Jupiter, without bringing about any sensible alteration either in&#10;the masses or in the orbits of these secondary planets. We had long&#10;regarded the wanderers as vapory creations of inconceivable&#10;tenuity, and as altogether incapable of doing injury to our&#10;substantial globe, even in the event of contact. But contact was&#10;not in any degree dreaded; for the elements of all the comets were&#10;accurately known. That among them we should look for the agency of&#10;the threatened fiery destruction had been for many years considered&#10;an inadmissible idea. But wonders and wild fancies had been, of&#10;late days, strangely rife among mankind; and although it was only&#10;with a few of the ignorant that actual apprehension prevailed, upon&#10;the announcement by astronomers of a new comet, yet this&#10;announcement was generally received with I know not what of&#10;agitation and mistrust.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The elements of the strange orb were immediately calculated, and&#10;it was at once conceded by all observers, that its path, at&#10;perihelion, would bring it into very close proximity with the&#10;earth. There were two or three astronomers, of secondary note, who&#10;resolutely maintained that a contact was inevitable. I cannot very&#10;well express to you the effect of this intelligence upon the&#10;people. For a few short days they would not believe an assertion&#10;which their intellect, so long employed among worldly&#10;considerations, could not in any manner grasp. But the truth of a&#10;vitally important fact soon makes its way into the understanding of&#10;even the most stolid. Finally, all men saw that astronomical&#10;knowledge lied not, and they awaited the comet. Its approach was&#10;not, at first, seemingly rapid; nor was its appearance of very&#10;unusual character. It was of a dull red, and had little perceptible&#10;train. For seven or eight days we saw no material increase in its&#10;apparent diameter, and but a partial alteration in its color.&#10;Meantime the ordinary affairs of men were discarded, and all&#10;interests absorbed in a growing discussion, instituted by the&#10;philosophic, in respect to the cometary nature. Even the grossly&#10;ignorant aroused their sluggish capacities to such considerations.&#10;The learned now gave their intellect&#8212;their soul&#8212;to no such points&#10;as the allaying of fear, or to the sustenance of loved theory. They&#10;sought- they panted for right views. They groaned for perfected&#10;knowledge. Truth arose in the purity of her strength and exceeding&#10;majesty, and the wise bowed down and adored.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;That material injury to our globe or to its inhabitants would&#10;result from the apprehended contact, was an opinion which hourly&#10;lost ground among the wise; and the wise were now freely permitted&#10;to rule the reason and the fancy of the crowd. It was demonstrated,&#10;that the density of the comet&#39;s nucleus was far less than that of&#10;our rarest gas; and the harmless passage of a similar visitor among&#10;the satellites of Jupiter was a point strongly insisted upon, and&#10;which served greatly to allay terror. Theologists, with an&#10;earnestness fear-enkindled, dwelt upon the biblical prophecies, and&#10;expounded them to the people with a directness and simplicity of&#10;which no previous instance had been known. That the final&#10;destruction of the earth must be brought about by the agency of&#10;fire, was urged with a spirit that enforced everywhere conviction;&#10;and that the comets were of no fiery nature (as all men now knew)&#10;was a truth which relieved all, in a great measure, from the&#10;apprehension of the great calamity foretold. It is noticeable that&#10;the popular prejudices and vulgar errors in regard to pestilences&#10;and wars&#8212;errors which were wont to prevail upon every appearance of&#10;a comet&#8212;were now altogether unknown. As if by some sudden&#10;convulsive exertion, reason had at once hurled superstition from&#10;her throne. The feeblest intellect had derived vigor from excessive&#10;interest.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;What minor evils might arise from the contact were points of&#10;elaborate question. The learned spoke of slight geological&#10;disturbances, of probable alterations in climate, and consequently&#10;in vegetation; of possible magnetic and electric influences. Many&#10;held that no visible or perceptible effect would in any manner be&#10;produced. While such discussions were going on, their subject&#10;gradually approached, growing larger in apparent diameter, and of a&#10;more brilliant lustre. Mankind grew paler as it came. All human&#10;operations were suspended. There was an epoch in the course of the&#10;general sentiment when the comet had attained, at length, a size&#10;surpassing that of any previously recorded visitation. The people&#10;now, dismissing any lingering hope that the astronomers were wrong,&#10;experienced all the certainty of evil. The chimerical aspect of&#10;their terror was gone. The hearts of the stoutest of our race beat&#10;violently within their bosoms. A very few days sufficed, however,&#10;to merge even such feelings in sentiments more unendurable. We&#10;could no longer apply to the strange orb any accustomed thoughts.&#10;Its historical attributes had disappeared. It oppressed us with a&#10;hideous novelty of emotion. We saw it not as an astronomical&#10;phenomenon in the heavens, but as an incubus upon our hearts, and a&#10;shadow upon our brains. It had taken, with inconceivable rapidity,&#10;the character of a gigantic mantle of rare flame, extending from&#10;horizon to horizon.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Yet a day, and men breathed with greater freedom. It was clear&#10;that we were already within the influence of the comet; yet we&#10;lived. We even felt an unusual elasticity of frame and vivacity of&#10;mind. The exceeding tenuity of the object of our dread was&#10;apparent; for all heavenly objects were plainly visible through it.&#10;Meantime, our vegetation had perceptibly altered; and we gained&#10;faith, from this predicted circumstance, in the foresight of the&#10;wise. A wild luxuriance of foliage, utterly unknown before, burst&#10;out upon every vegetable thing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Yet another day&#8212;and the evil was not altogether upon us. It was&#10;now evident that its nucleus would first reach us. A wild change&#10;had come over all men; and the first sense of pain was the wild&#10;signal for general lamentation and horror. This first sense of pain&#10;lay in a rigorous constriction of the breast and lungs, and an&#10;insufferable dryness of the skin. It could not be denied that our&#10;atmosphere was radically affected; the conformation of this&#10;atmosphere and the possible modifications to which it might be&#10;subjected, were now the topics of discussion. The result of&#10;investigation sent an electric thrill of the intensest terror&#10;through the universal heart of man.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It had been long known that the air which encircled us was a&#10;compound of oxygen and nitrogen gases, in the proportion of&#10;twenty-one measures of oxygen, and seventy-nine of nitrogen, in&#10;every one hundred of the atmosphere. Oxygen, which was the&#10;principle of combustion, and the vehicle of heat, was absolutely&#10;necessary to the support of animal life, and was the most powerful&#10;and energetic agent in nature. Nitrogen, on the contrary, was&#10;incapable of supporting either animal life or flame. An unnatural&#10;excess of oxygen would result, it had been ascertained, in just&#10;such an elevation of the animal spirits as we had latterly&#10;experienced. It was the pursuit, the extension of the idea, which&#10;had engendered awe. What would be the result of a total extraction&#10;of the nitrogen? A combustion irresistible, all-devouring,&#10;omni-prevalent, immediate; the entire fulfillment, in all their&#10;minute and terrible details, of the fiery and horror-inspiring&#10;denunciations of the prophecies of the Holy Book.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Why need I paint, Charmion, the now disenchained frenzy of&#10;mankind? That tenuity in the comet which had previously inspired us&#10;with hope, was now the source of the bitterness of despair. In its&#10;impalpable gaseous character we clearly perceived the consummation&#10;of Fate. Meantime a day again passed, bearing away with it the last&#10;shadow of Hope. We gasped in the rapid modification of the air. The&#10;red blood bounded tumultuously through its strict channels. A&#10;furious delirium possessed all men; and, with arms rigidly&#10;outstretched toward the threatening heavens, they trembled and&#10;shrieked aloud. But the nucleus of the destroyer was now upon us;&#10;even here in Aidenn, I shudder while I speak. Let me be brief&#8212;brief&#10;as the ruin that overwhelmed. For a moment there was a wild lurid&#10;light alone, visiting and penetrating all things. Then&#8212;let us bow&#10;down, Charmion, before the excessive majesty of the great&#10;God!&#8212;then, there came a shouting and pervading sound, as if from&#10;the mouth itself of HIM; while the whole incumbent mass of ether in&#10;which we existed, burst at once into a species of intense flame,&#10;for whose surpassing brilliancy and all-fervid heat even the angels&#10;in the high Heaven of pure knowledge have no name. Thus ended&#10;all.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 1, :source => 'feedbooks')

The outline indeed is all we see; but&#10;there they stand, shrouded in darkness, and fright us with the&#10;mystery which defies farther scrutiny&#8230; His genius, as well as&#10;private history, puts us in mind of that of Coleridge.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8212; Judge Beverly Tucker (of Va.,) author of &#34;George&#10;Balcombe.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There can be but one opinion in regard to the force and beauty&#10;of his style&#8230; He discovers a superior capacity and a highly&#10;cultivated taste&#8230; A gentleman of fine endowments, possessing a&#10;taste classical and refined, an imagination affluent and splendid,&#10;and withal a singular capacity for minute and mathematical detail&#8230;&#10;We always predicted that he would reach a high grade in American&#10;literature&#8230; &#34;Morella&#34; will unquestionably prove that Mr. Poe has&#10;great powers of imagination, and a command of language never&#10;surpassed. We doubt if anything in the same style can be cited&#10;which contains more terrific beauty than this tale.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8212; James E.

The &#34;Fall of the House of Usher&#34; is what we&#10;denominate a stern and sombre, but at the same time a noble and&#10;imposing picture, such as can be drawn only by a master-hand.

Mr.&#10;Poe is no imitator in story-telling. He has a peculiarity of his&#10;own &#8212; dealing often in rather wild imaginings, and yet he always&#10;contrives to sustain his plots with so much novelty of incident,&#10;that you must read him out in spite of any sober realities that may&#10;occasionally flit across the mind. And as you read you are ever&#10;impressed with the truth that he has much fancy, great richness of&#10;description, and true poetry for his imagery and colorings.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8212; Phil. Sat. Courier (E.

With&#10;an acuteness of observation, a vigorous and effective style, and an&#10;independence that defies control, he unites a fervid fancy and a&#10;most beautiful enthusiasm.
