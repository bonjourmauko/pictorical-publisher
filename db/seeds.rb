If he was&#10;dead, I thought, I would see the reflection of candles on the&#10;darkened blind, for I knew that two candles must be set at the head&#10;of a corpse. He had often said to me: I am not long for this world&#10;and I had thought his words idle. Now I knew they were true. Every&#10;night as I gazed up at the window I said softly to myself the word&#10;paralysis. It had always sounded strangely in my ears, like the&#10;word gnomon in the Euclid and the word simony in the Catechism. But&#10;now it sounded to me like the name of some maleficent and sinful&#10;being. It filled me with fear, and yet I longed to be nearer to it&#10;and to look upon its deadly work.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Old Cotter was sitting at the fire, smoking, when I came&#10;downstairs to supper. While my aunt was ladling out my stirabout he&#10;said, as if returning to some former remark of his:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8212; No, I wouldn&#39;t say he was exactly&#8230; but there was something&#10;queer&#8230; there was something uncanny about him. I&#39;ll tell you my&#10;opinion&#8230;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He began to puff at his pipe, no doubt arranging his opinion in&#10;his mind. Tiresome old fool! When we knew him first he used to be&#10;rather interesting, talking of faints and worms, but I soon grew&#10;tired of him and his endless stories about the distillery.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8212; I have my own theory about it, he said. I think it was one of&#10;those&#8230; peculiar cases&#8230; But it&#39;s hard to say&#8230;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He began to puff again at his pipe without giving us his theory.&#10;My uncle saw me staring and said to me:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8212; Well, so your old friend is gone, you&#39;ll be sorry to hear.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8212; Who? said I.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8212; Father Flynn.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8212; Is he dead?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8212; Mr Cotter here has just told us. He was passing by the&#10;house.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I knew that I was under observation so I continued eating as if&#10;the news had not interested me. My uncle explained to old&#10;Cotter:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8212; The youngster and he were great friends. The old chap taught&#10;him a great deal, mind you; and they say he had a great wish for&#10;him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8212; God have mercy on his soul, said my aunt piously.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Old Cotter looked at me for a while. I felt that his little&#10;beady black eyes were examining me but I would not satisfy him by&#10;looking up from my plate. He returned to his pipe and finally spat&#10;rudely into the grate.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8212; I wouldn&#39;t like children of mine, he said, to have too much to&#10;say to a man like that.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8212; How do you mean, Mr Cotter? asked my aunt.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8212; What I mean is, said old Cotter, it&#39;s bad for children. My&#10;idea is: let a young lad run about and play with young lads of his&#10;own age and not be&#8230; Am I right, Jack?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8212; That&#39;s my principle too, said my uncle. Let him learn to box&#10;his corner. That&#39;s what I&#39;m always saying to that Rosicrucian&#10;there: take exercise. Why, when I was a nipper every morning of my&#10;life I had a cold bath, winter and summer. And that&#39;s what stands&#10;to me now. Education is all very fine and large&#8230; Mr Cotter might&#10;take a pick of that leg of mutton, he added to my aunt.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8212; No, no, not for me, said old Cotter.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;My aunt brought the dish from the safe and laid it on the&#10;table.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8212; But why do you think it&#39;s not good for children, Mr Cotter?&#10;she asked.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8212; It&#39;s bad for children, said old Cotter, because their minds&#10;are so impressionable. When children see things like that, you&#10;know, it has an effect&#8230;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I crammed my mouth with stirabout for fear I might give&#10;utterance to my anger. Tiresome old red-nosed imbecile!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was late when I fell asleep. Though I was angry with old&#10;Cotter for alluding to me as a child, I puzzled my head to extract&#10;meaning from his unfinished sentences. In the dark of my room I&#10;imagined that I saw again the heavy grey face of the paralytic. I&#10;drew the blankets over my head and tried to think of Christmas. But&#10;the grey face still followed me. It murmured, and I understood that&#10;it desired to confess something. I felt my soul receding into some&#10;pleasant and vicious region, and there again I found it waiting for&#10;me. It began to confess to me in a murmuring voice and I wondered&#10;why it smiled continually and why the lips were so moist with&#10;spittle. But then I remembered that it had died of paralysis and I&#10;felt that I too was smiling feebly, as if to absolve the simoniac&#10;of his sin.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The next morning after breakfast I went down to look at the&#10;little house in Great Britain Street. It was an unassuming shop,&#10;registered under the vague name of Drapery. The drapery consisted&#10;mainly of children&#39;s bootees and umbrellas, and on ordinary days a&#10;notice used to hang in the window saying: Umbrellas Recovered. No&#10;notice was visible now for the shutters were up. A crape bouquet&#10;was tied to the door-knocker with ribbon. Two poor women and a&#10;telegram boy were reading the card pinned on the crape. I also&#10;approached and read:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;July 1st, 1895 The Rev. James Flynn (formerly of S. Catherine&#39;s&#10;Church, Meath Street), aged sixty-five years. R.I.P.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The reading of the card persuaded me that he was dead and I was&#10;disturbed to find myself at check. Had he not been dead I would&#10;have gone into the little dark room behind the shop to find him&#10;sitting in his arm-chair by the fire, nearly smothered in his&#10;greatcoat. Perhaps my aunt would have given me a packet of High&#10;Toast for him, and this present would have roused him from his&#10;stupefied doze. It was always I who emptied the packet into his&#10;black snuff-box, for his hands trembled too much to allow him to do&#10;this without spilling half the snuff about the floor. Even as he&#10;raised his large trembling hand to his nose little clouds of smoke&#10;dribbled through his fingers over the front of his coat. It may&#10;have been these constant showers of snuff which gave his ancient&#10;priestly garments their green faded look, for the red handkerchief,&#10;blackened as it always was with the snuff-stains of a week, with&#10;which he tried to brush away the fallen grains, was quite&#10;inefficacious.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I wished to go in and look at him but I had not the courage to&#10;knock. I walked away slowly along the sunny side of the street,&#10;reading all the theatrical advertisements in the shop-windows as I&#10;went. I found it strange that neither I nor the day seemed in a&#10;mourning mood, and I felt even annoyed at discovering in myself a&#10;sensation of freedom as if I had been freed from something by his&#10;death. I wondered at this for, as my uncle had said the night&#10;before, he had taught me a great deal. He had studied in the Irish&#10;college in Rome and he had taught me to pronounce Latin properly.&#10;He had told me stories about the catacombs and about Napoleon&#10;Bonaparte, and he had explained to me the meaning of the different&#10;ceremonies of the Mass and of the different vestments worn by the&#10;priest. Sometimes he had amused himself by putting difficult&#10;questions to me, asking me what one should do in certain&#10;circumstances or whether such and such sins were mortal or venial&#10;or only imperfections. His questions showed me how complex and&#10;mysterious were certain institutions of the Church which I had&#10;always regarded as the simplest acts. The duties of the priest&#10;towards the Eucharist and towards the secrecy of the confessional&#10;seemed so grave to me that I wondered how anybody had ever found in&#10;himself the courage to undertake them, and I was not surprised when&#10;he told me that the fathers of the Church had written books as&#10;thick as the Post Office Directory and as closely printed as the&#10;law notices in the newspaper elucidating all these intricate&#10;questions. Often when I thought of this I could make no answer or&#10;only a very foolish and halting one, upon which he used to smile&#10;and nod his head twice or thrice. Sometimes he used to put me&#10;through the responses of the Mass, which he had made me learn by&#10;heart, and as I pattered he used to smile pensively and nod his&#10;head, now and then pushing huge pinches of snuff up each nostril&#10;alternately. When he smiled he used to uncover his big discoloured&#10;teeth and let his tongue lie upon his lower lip&#8212; a habit which had&#10;made me feel uneasy in the beginning of our acquaintance, before I&#10;knew him well.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As I walked along in the sun I remembered old Cotter&#39;s words and&#10;tried to remember what had happened afterwards in the dream. I&#10;remembered that I had noticed long velvet curtains and a swinging&#10;lamp of antique fashion. I felt that I had been very far away, in&#10;some land where the customs were strange&#8212; in Persia, I thought&#8230; But&#10;I could not remember the end of the dream.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In the evening my aunt took me with her to visit the house of&#10;mourning. It was after sunset, but the window-panes of the houses&#10;that looked to the west reflected the tawny gold of a great bank of&#10;clouds. Nannie received us in the hall, and as it would have been&#10;unseemly to have shouted at her my aunt shook hands with her for&#10;all. The old woman pointed upwards interrogatively and, on my&#10;aunt&#39;s nodding, proceeded to toil up the narrow staircase before&#10;us, her bowed head being scarcely above the level of the&#10;banister-rail. At the first landing she stopped and beckoned us&#10;forward encouragingly towards the open door of the dead-room. My&#10;aunt went in and the old woman, seeing that I hesitated to enter,&#10;began to beckon to me again repeatedly with her hand.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I went in on tiptoe. The room through the lace end of the blind&#10;was suffused with dusky golden light, amid which the candles looked&#10;like pale thin flames. He had been coffined. Nannie gave the lead&#10;and we three knelt down at the foot of the bed. I pretended to pray&#10;but I could not gather my thoughts because the old woman&#39;s&#10;mutterings distracted me. I noticed how clumsily her skirt was&#10;hooked at the back and how the heels of her cloth boots were&#10;trodden down all to one side. The fancy came to me that the old&#10;priest was smiling as he lay there in his coffin.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But no. When we rose and went up to the head of the bed I saw&#10;that he was not smiling. There he lay, solemn and copious, vested&#10;as for the altar, his large hands loosely retaining a chalice. His&#10;face was very truculent, grey and massive with black cavernous&#10;nostrils and circled by a scanty white fur. There was a heavy odour&#10;in the room&#8212; the flowers.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;We crossed ourselves and came away. In the little room&#10;downstairs we found Eliza seated in his arm-chair in state. I&#10;groped my way towards my usual chair in the corner while Nannie&#10;went to the sideboard and brought out a decanter of sherry and some&#10;wine-glasses. She set these on the table and invited us to take a&#10;little glass of wine. Then, at her sister&#39;s bidding, she filled out&#10;the sherry into the glasses and passed them to us. She pressed me&#10;to take some cream crackers also, but I declined because I thought&#10;I would make too much noise eating them. She seemed to be somewhat&#10;disappointed at my refusal and went over quietly to the sofa, where&#10;she sat down behind her sister. No one spoke: we all gazed at the&#10;empty fireplace.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;My aunt waited until Eliza sighed and then said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8212; Ah, well, he&#39;s gone to a better world.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Eliza sighed again and bowed her head in assent. My aunt&#10;fingered the stem of her wine-glass before sipping a little.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8212; Did he&#8230; peacefully? she asked.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8212; Oh, quite peacefully, ma&#39;am, said Eliza. You couldn&#39;t tell&#10;when the breath went out of him. He had a beautiful death, God be&#10;praised.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8212; And everything&#8230; ?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8212; Father O&#39;Rourke was in with him a Tuesday and anointed him and&#10;prepared him and all.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8212; He knew then?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8212; He was quite resigned.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8212; He looks quite resigned, said my aunt.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8212; That&#39;s what the woman we had in to wash him said. She said he&#10;just looked as if he was asleep, he looked that peaceful and&#10;resigned. No one would think he&#39;d make such a beautiful corpse.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8212; Yes, indeed, said my aunt.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She sipped a little more from her glass and said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8212; Well, Miss Flynn, at any rate it must be a great comfort for&#10;you to know that you did all you could for him. You were both very&#10;kind to him, I must say.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Eliza smoothed her dress over her knees.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8212; Ah, poor James! she said. God knows we done all we could, as&#10;poor as we are&#8212; we wouldn&#39;t see him want anything while he was in&#10;it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Nannie had leaned her head against the sofa-pillow and seemed&#10;about to fall asleep.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8212; There&#39;s poor Nannie, said Eliza, looking at her, she&#39;s wore&#10;out. All the work we had, she and me, getting in the woman to wash&#10;him and then laying him out and then the coffin and then arranging&#10;about the mass in the chapel. Only for Father O&#39;Rourke I don&#39;t know&#10;what we&#39;d have done at all. It was him brought us all them flowers&#10;and them two candlesticks out of the chapel and wrote out the&#10;notice for the Freeman&#39;s General and took charge of all the papers&#10;for the cemetery and poor James&#39;s insurance.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8212; Wasn&#39;t that good of him? said my aunt.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Eliza closed her eyes and shook her head slowly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8212; Ah, there&#39;s no friends like the old friends, she said, when&#10;all is said and done, no friends that a body can trust.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8212; Indeed, that&#39;s true, said my aunt. And I&#39;m sure now that he&#39;s&#10;gone to his eternal reward he won&#39;t forget you and all your&#10;kindness to him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8212; Ah, poor James! said Eliza. He was no great trouble to us. You&#10;wouldn&#39;t hear him in the house any more than now. Still, I know&#10;he&#39;s gone and all to that.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8212; It&#39;s when it&#39;s all over that you&#39;ll miss him, said my&#10;aunt.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8212; I know that, said Eliza. I won&#39;t be bringing him in his cup of&#10;beef tea any more, nor you, ma&#39;am, sending him his snuff. Ah, poor&#10;James!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She stopped, as if she were communing with the past, and then&#10;said shrewdly:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8212; Mind you, I noticed there was something queer coming over him&#10;latterly. Whenever I&#39;d bring in his soup to him there I&#39;d find him&#10;with his breviary fallen to the floor, lying back in the chair and&#10;his mouth open.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She laid a finger against her nose and frowned: then she&#10;continued:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8212; But still and all he kept on saying that before the summer was&#10;over he&#39;d go out for a drive one fine day just to see the old house&#10;again where we were all born down in Irishtown and take me and&#10;Nannie with him. If we could only get one of them new-fangled&#10;carriages that makes no noise that Father O&#39;Rourke told him about,&#10;them with the rheumatic wheels&#8212; for the day cheap, he said, at&#10;Johnny Rush&#39;s over the way there and drive out the three of us&#10;together of a Sunday evening. He had his mind set on that&#8230; Poor&#10;James!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8212; The Lord have mercy on his soul! said my aunt.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Eliza took out her handkerchief and wiped her eyes with it. Then&#10;she put it back again in her pocket and gazed into the empty grate&#10;for some time without speaking.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8212; He was too scrupulous always, she said. The duties of the&#10;priesthood was too much for him. And then his life was, you might&#10;say, crossed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8212; Yes, said my aunt. He was a disappointed man. You could see&#10;that.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A silence took possession of the little room and, under cover of&#10;it, I approached the table and tasted my sherry and then returned&#10;quietly to my chair in the corner. Eliza seemed to have fallen into&#10;a deep revery. We waited respectfully for her to break the silence:&#10;and after a long pause she said slowly:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8212; It was that chalice he broke&#8230; That was the beginning of it. Of&#10;course, they say it was all right, that it contained nothing, I&#10;mean. But still&#8230; They say it was the boy&#39;s fault. But poor James&#10;was so nervous, God be merciful to him!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8212; And was that it? said my aunt. I heard something&#8230;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Eliza nodded.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8212; That affected his mind, she said. After that he began to mope&#10;by himself, talking to no one and wandering about by himself. So&#10;one night he was wanted for to go on a call and they couldn&#39;t find&#10;him anywhere. They looked high up and low down and still they&#10;couldn&#39;t see a sight of him anywhere. So then the clerk suggested&#10;to try the chapel. So then they got the keys and opened the chapel,&#10;and the clerk and Father O&#39;Rourke and another priest that was there&#10;brought in a light for to look for him&#8230; And what do you think but&#10;there he was, sitting up by himself in the dark in his&#10;confession-box, wide-awake and laughing-like softly to himself?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She stopped suddenly as if to listen. I too listened, but there&#10;was no sound in the house: and I knew that the old priest was lying&#10;still in his coffin as we had seen him, solemn and truculent in&#10;death, an idle chalice on his breast.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Eliza resumed:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8212; Wide-awake and laughing-like to himself&#8230; So then, of course,&#10;when they saw that, that made them think that there was something&#10;gone wrong with him&#8230;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 8, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/5', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode(' An&#10;Encounter'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was Joe Dillon who introduced the Wild West to us. He had a&#10;little library made up of old numbers of The Union Jack , Pluck and&#10;The Halfpenny Marvel . Every evening after school we met in his&#10;back garden and arranged Indian battles. He and his fat young&#10;brother Leo, the idler, held the loft of the stable while we tried&#10;to carry it by storm; or we fought a pitched battle on the grass.&#10;But, however well we fought, we never won siege or battle and all&#10;our bouts ended with Joe Dillon&#39;s war dance of victory. His parents&#10;went to eight- o&#39;clock mass every morning in Gardiner Street and&#10;the peaceful odour of Mrs. Dillon was prevalent in the hall of the&#10;house. But he played too fiercely for us who were younger and more&#10;timid. He looked like some kind of an Indian when he capered round&#10;the garden, an old tea-cosy on his head, beating a tin with his&#10;fist and yelling:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ya! yaka, yaka, yaka!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Everyone was incredulous when it was reported that he had a&#10;vocation for the priesthood. Nevertheless it was true.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A spirit of unruliness diffused itself among us and, under its&#10;influence, differences of culture and constitution were waived. We&#10;banded ourselves together, some boldly, some in jest and some&#10;almost in fear: and of the number of these latter, the reluctant&#10;Indians who were afraid to seem studious or lacking in robustness,&#10;I was one. The adventures related in the literature of the Wild&#10;West were remote from my nature but, at least, they opened doors of&#10;escape. I liked better some American detective stories which were&#10;traversed from time to time by unkempt fierce and beautiful girls.&#10;Though there was nothing wrong in these stories and though their&#10;intention was sometimes literary they were circulated secretly at&#10;school. One day when Father Butler was hearing the four pages of&#10;Roman History clumsy Leo Dillon was discovered with a copy of The&#10;Halfpenny Marvel .&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;This page or this page? This page Now, Dillon, up! &#39;Hardly had&#10;the day&#39;&#38;#160;&#8230; Go on! What day? &#39;Hardly had the day dawned&#39;&#38;#160;&#8230;&#10;Have you studied it? What have you there in your pocket?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Everyone&#39;s heart palpitated as Leo Dillon handed up the paper&#10;and everyone assumed an innocent face. Father Butler turned over&#10;the pages, frowning.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What is this rubbish?&#34; he said. &#34;The Apache Chief! Is this what&#10;you read instead of studying your Roman History? Let me not find&#10;any more of this wretched stuff in this college. The man who wrote&#10;it, I suppose, was some wretched fellow who writes these things for&#10;a drink. I&#39;m surprised at boys like you, educated, reading such&#10;stuff. I could understand it if you were&#38;#160;&#8230; National School&#10;boys. Now, Dillon, I advise you strongly, get at your work or&#8230;&#10;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;This rebuke during the sober hours of school paled much of the&#10;glory of the Wild West for me and the confused puffy face of Leo&#10;Dillon awakened one of my consciences. But when the restraining&#10;influence of the school was at a distance I began to hunger again&#10;for wild sensations, for the escape which those chronicles of&#10;disorder alone seemed to offer me. The mimic warfare of the evening&#10;became at last as wearisome to me as the routine of school in the&#10;morning because I wanted real adventures to happen to myself. But&#10;real adventures, I reflected, do not happen to people who remain at&#10;home: they must be sought abroad.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The summer holidays were near at hand when I made up my mind to&#10;break out of the weariness of schoollife for one day at least. With&#10;Leo Dillon and a boy named Mahony I planned a day&#39;s miching. Each&#10;of us saved up sixpence. We were to meet at ten in the morning on&#10;the Canal Bridge. Mahony&#39;s big sister was to write an excuse for&#10;him and Leo Dillon was to tell his brother to say he was sick. We&#10;arranged to go along the Wharf Road until we came to the ships,&#10;then to cross in the ferryboat and walk out to see the Pigeon&#10;House. Leo Dillon was afraid we might meet Father Butler or someone&#10;out of the college; but Mahony asked, very sensibly, what would&#10;Father Butler be doing out at the Pigeon House. We were reassured:&#10;and I brought the first stage of the plot to an end by collecting&#10;sixpence from the other two, at the same time showing them my own&#10;sixpence. When we were making the last arrangements on the eve we&#10;were all vaguely excited. We shook hands, laughing, and Mahony&#10;said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Till tomorrow, mates!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;That night I slept badly. In the morning I was firstcomer to the&#10;bridge as I lived nearest. I hid my books in the long grass near&#10;the ashpit at the end of the garden where nobody ever came and&#10;hurried along the canal bank. It was a mild sunny morning in the&#10;first week of June. I sat up on the coping of the bridge admiring&#10;my frail canvas shoes which I had diligently pipeclayed overnight&#10;and watching the docile horses pulling a tramload of business&#10;people up the hill. All the branches of the tall trees which lined&#10;the mall were gay with little light green leaves and the sunlight&#10;slanted through them on to the water. The granite stone of the&#10;bridge was beginning to be warm and I began to pat it with my hands&#10;in time to an air in my head. I was very happy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When I had been sitting there for five or ten minutes I saw&#10;Mahony&#39;s grey suit approaching. He came up the hill, smiling, and&#10;clambered up beside me on the bridge. While we were waiting he&#10;brought out the catapult which bulged from his inner pocket and&#10;explained some improvements which he had made in it. I asked him&#10;why he had brought it and he told me he had brought it to have some&#10;gas with the birds. Mahony used slang freely, and spoke of Father&#10;Butler as Old Bunser. We waited on for a quarter of an hour more&#10;but still there was no sign of Leo Dillon. Mahony, at last, jumped&#10;down and said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Come along. I knew Fatty&#39;d funk it.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And his sixpence&#8230; ?&#34; I said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That&#39;s forfeit,&#34; said Mahony. &#34;And so much the better for us &#8212;&#10;a bob and a tanner instead of a bob.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;We walked along the North Strand Road till we came to the&#10;Vitriol Works and then turned to the right along the Wharf Road.&#10;Mahony began to play the Indian as soon as we were out of public&#10;sight. He chased a crowd of ragged girls, brandishing his unloaded&#10;catapult and, when two ragged boys began, out of chivalry, to fling&#10;stones at us, he proposed that we should charge them. I objected&#10;that the boys were too small and so we walked on, the ragged troop&#10;screaming after us: &#34;Swaddlers! Swaddlers!&#34; thinking that we were&#10;Protestants because Mahony, who was dark-complexioned, wore the&#10;silver badge of a cricket club in his cap. When we came to the&#10;Smoothing Iron we arranged a siege; but it was a failure because&#10;you must have at least three. We revenged ourselves on Leo Dillon&#10;by saying what a funk he was and guessing how many he would get at&#10;three o&#39;clock from Mr. Ryan.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;We came then near the river. We spent a long time walking about&#10;the noisy streets flanked by high stone walls, watching the working&#10;of cranes and engines and often being shouted at for our immobility&#10;by the drivers of groaning carts. It was noon when we reached the&#10;quays and as all the labourers seemed to be eating their lunches,&#10;we bought two big currant buns and sat down to eat them on some&#10;metal piping beside the river We pleased ourselves with the&#10;spectacle of Dublin&#39;s commerce &#8212; the barges signalled from far away&#10;by their curls of woolly smoke, the brown fishing fleet beyond&#10;Ringsend, the big white sailingvessel which was being discharged on&#10;the opposite quay. Mahony said it would be right skit to run away&#10;to sea on one of those big ships and even I, looking at the high&#10;masts, saw, or imagined, the geography which had been scantily&#10;dosed to me at school gradually taking substance under my eyes.&#10;School and home seemed to recede from us and their influences upon&#10;us seemed to wane.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;We crossed the Liffey in the ferryboat, paying our toll to be&#10;transported in the company of two labourers and a little Jew with a&#10;bag. We were serious to the point of solemnity, but once during the&#10;short voyage our eyes met and we laughed. When we landed we watched&#10;the discharging of the graceful threemaster which we had observed&#10;from the other quay. Some bystander said that she was a Norwegian&#10;vessel. I went to the stern and tried to decipher the legend upon&#10;it but, failing to do so, I came back and examined the foreign&#10;sailors to see had any of them green eyes for I had some confused&#10;notion&#8230; . The sailors&#39; eyes were blue and grey and even black. The&#10;only sailor whose eyes could have been called green was a tall man&#10;who amused the crowd on the quay by calling out cheerfully every&#10;time the planks fell:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;All right! All right!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When we were tired of this sight we wandered slowly into&#10;Ringsend. The day had grown sultry, and in the windows of the&#10;grocers&#39; shops musty biscuits lay bleaching. We bought some&#10;biscuits and chocolate which we ate sedulously as we wandered&#10;through the squalid streets where the families of the fishermen&#10;live. We could find no dairy and so we went into a huckster&#39;s shop&#10;and bought a bottle of raspberry lemonade each. Refreshed by this,&#10;Mahony chased a cat down a lane, but the cat escaped into a wide&#10;field. We both felt rather tired and when we reached the field we&#10;made at once for a sloping bank over the ridge of which we could&#10;see the Dodder.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was too late and we were too tired to carry out our project&#10;of visiting the Pigeon House. We had to be home before four o&#39;clock&#10;lest our adventure should be discovered. Mahony looked regretfully&#10;at his catapult and I had to suggest going home by train before he&#10;regained any cheerfulness. The sun went in behind some clouds and&#10;left us to our jaded thoughts and the crumbs of our provisions.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There was nobody but ourselves in the field. When we had lain on&#10;the bank for some time without speaking I saw a man approaching&#10;from the far end of the field. I watched him lazily as I chewed one&#10;of those green stems on which girls tell fortunes. He came along by&#10;the bank slowly. He walked with one hand upon his hip and in the&#10;other hand he held a stick with which he tapped the turf lightly.&#10;He was shabbily dressed in a suit of greenish-black and wore what&#10;we used to call a jerry hat with a high crown. He seemed to be&#10;fairly old for his moustache was ashen-grey. When he passed at our&#10;feet he glanced up at us quickly and then continued his way. We&#10;followed him with our eyes and saw that when he had gone on for&#10;perhaps fifty paces he turned about and began to retrace his steps.&#10;He walked towards us very slowly, always tapping the ground with&#10;his stick, so slowly that I thought he was looking for something in&#10;the grass.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He stopped when he came level with us and bade us goodday. We&#10;answered him and he sat down beside us on the slope slowly and with&#10;great care. He began to talk of the weather, saying that it would&#10;be a very hot summer and adding that the seasons had changed gready&#10;since he was a boy &#8212; a long time ago. He said that the happiest&#10;time of one&#39;s life was undoubtedly one&#39;s schoolboy days and that he&#10;would give anything to be young again. While he expressed these&#10;sentiments which bored us a little we kept silent. Then he began to&#10;talk of school and of books. He asked us whether we had read the&#10;poetry of Thomas Moore or the works of Sir Walter Scott and Lord&#10;Lytton. I pretended that I had read every book he mentioned so that&#10;in the end he said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ah, I can see you are a bookworm like myself. Now,&#34; he added,&#10;pointing to Mahony who was regarding us with open eyes, &#34;he is&#10;different; he goes in for games.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He said he had all Sir Walter Scott&#39;s works and all Lord&#10;Lytton&#39;s works at home and never tired of reading them. &#34;Of&#10;course,&#34; he said, &#34;there were some of Lord Lytton&#39;s works which&#10;boys couldn&#39;t read.&#34; Mahony asked why couldn&#39;t boys read them &#8212; a&#10;question which agitated and pained me because I was afraid the man&#10;would think I was as stupid as Mahony. The man, however, only&#10;smiled. I saw that he had great gaps in his mouth between his&#10;yellow teeth. Then he asked us which of us had the most&#10;sweethearts. Mahony mentioned lightly that he had three totties.&#10;The man asked me how many I had. I answered that I had none. He did&#10;not believe me and said he was sure I must have one. I was&#10;silent.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Tell us,&#34; said Mahony pertly to the man, &#34;how many have you&#10;yourself?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The man smiled as before and said that when he was our age he&#10;had lots of sweethearts.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Every boy,&#34; he said, &#34;has a little sweetheart.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;His attitude on this point struck me as strangely liberal in a&#10;man of his age. In my heart I thought that what he said about boys&#10;and sweethearts was reasonable. But I disliked the words in his&#10;mouth and I wondered why he shivered once or twice as if he feared&#10;something or felt a sudden chill. As he proceeded I noticed that&#10;his accent was good. He began to speak to us about girls, saying&#10;what nice soft hair they had and how soft their hands were and how&#10;all girls were not so good as they seemed to be if one only knew.&#10;There was nothing he liked, he said, so much as looking at a nice&#10;young girl, at her nice white hands and her beautiful soft hair. He&#10;gave me the impression that he was repeating something which he had&#10;learned by heart or that, magnetised by some words of his own&#10;speech, his mind was slowly circling round and round in the same&#10;orbit. At times he spoke as if he were simply alluding to some fact&#10;that everybody knew, and at times he lowered his voice and spoke&#10;mysteriously as if he were telling us something secret which he did&#10;not wish others to overhear. He repeated his phrases over and over&#10;again, varying them and surrounding them with his monotonous voice.&#10;I continued to gaze towards the foot of the slope, listening to&#10;him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;After a long while his monologue paused. He stood up slowly,&#10;saying that he had to leave us for a minute or so, a few minutes,&#10;and, without changing the direction of my gaze, I saw him walking&#10;slowly away from us towards the near end of the field. We remained&#10;silent when he had gone. After a silence of a few minutes I heard&#10;Mahony exclaim:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I say! Look what he&#39;s doing!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As I neither answered nor raised my eyes Mahony exclaimed&#10;again:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I say&#8230; He&#39;s a queer old josser!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In case he asks us for our names,&#34; I said &#34;let you be Murphy and&#10;I&#39;ll be Smith.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;We said nothing further to each other. I was still considering&#10;whether I would go away or not when the man came back and sat down&#10;beside us again. Hardly had he sat down when Mahony, catching sight&#10;of the cat which had escaped him, sprang up and pursued her across&#10;the field. The man and I watched the chase. The cat escaped once&#10;more and Mahony began to throw stones at the wall she had&#10;escaladed. Desisting from this, he began to wander about the far&#10;end of the field, aimlessly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;After an interval the man spoke to me. He said that my friend&#10;was a very rough boy and asked did he get whipped often at school.&#10;I was going to reply indignantly that we were not National School&#10;boys to be whipped, as he called it; but I remained silent. He&#10;began to speak on the subject of chastising boys. His mind, as if&#10;magnetised again by his speech, seemed to circle slowly round and&#10;round its new centre. He said that when boys were that kind they&#10;ought to be whipped and well whipped. When a boy was rough and&#10;unruly there was nothing would do him any good but a good sound&#10;whipping. A slap on the hand or a box on the ear was no good: what&#10;he wanted was to get a nice warm whipping. I was surprised at this&#10;sentiment and involuntarily glanced up at his face. As I did so I&#10;met the gaze of a pair of bottle-green eyes peering at me from&#10;under a twitching forehead. I turned my eyes away again.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The man continued his monologue. He seemed to have forgotten his&#10;recent liberalism. He said that if ever he found a boy talking to&#10;girls or having a girl for a sweetheart he would whip him and whip&#10;him; and that would teach him not to be talking to girls. And if a&#10;boy had a girl for a sweetheart and told lies about it then he&#10;would give him such a whipping as no boy ever got in this world. He&#10;said that there was nothing in this world he would like so well as&#10;that. He described to me how he would whip such a boy as if he were&#10;unfolding some elaborate mystery. He would love that, he said,&#10;better than anything in this world; and his voice, as he led me&#10;monotonously through the mystery, grew almost affectionate and&#10;seemed to plead with me that I should understand him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I waited till his monologue paused again. Then I stood up&#10;abruptly. Lest I should betray my agitation I delayed a few moments&#10;pretending to fix my shoe properly and then, saying that I was&#10;obliged to go, I bade him good-day. I went up the slope calmly but&#10;my heart was beating quickly with fear that he would seize me by&#10;the ankles. When I reached the top of the slope I turned round and,&#10;without looking at him, called loudly across the field:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Murphy!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;My voice had an accent of forced bravery in it and I was ashamed&#10;of my paltry stratagem. I had to call the name again before Mahony&#10;saw me and hallooed in answer. How my heart beat as he came running&#10;across the field to me! He ran as if to bring me aid. And I was&#10;penitent; for in my heart I had always despised him a little.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 8, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/5', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;Araby'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;North Richmond Street, being blind, was a quiet street except at&#10;the hour when the Christian Brothers&#39; School set the boys free. An&#10;uninhabited house of two storeys stood at the blind end, detached&#10;from its neighbours in a square ground. The other houses of the&#10;street, conscious of decent lives within them, gazed at one another&#10;with brown imperturbable faces.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The former tenant of our house, a priest, had died in the back&#10;drawing-room. Air, musty from having been long enclosed, hung in&#10;all the rooms, and the waste room behind the kitchen was littered&#10;with old useless papers. Among these I found a few paper-covered&#10;books, the pages of which were curled and damp: The Abbot, by&#10;Walter Scott, The Devout Communicant, and The Memoirs of Vidocq. I&#10;liked the last best because its leaves were yellow. The wild garden&#10;behind the house contained a central apple-tree and a few&#10;straggling bushes, under one of which I found the late tenant&#39;s&#10;rusty bicycle-pump. He had been a very charitable priest; in his&#10;will he had left all his money to institutions and the furniture of&#10;his house to his sister.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When the short days of winter came, dusk fell before we had well&#10;eaten our dinners. When we met in the street the houses had grown&#10;sombre. The space of sky above us was the colour of ever-changing&#10;violet and towards it the lamps of the street lifted their feeble&#10;lanterns. The cold air stung us and we played till our bodies&#10;glowed. Our shouts echoed in the silent street. The career of our&#10;play brought us through the dark muddy lanes behind the houses,&#10;where we ran the gauntlet of the rough tribes from the cottages, to&#10;the back doors of the dark dripping gardens where odours arose from&#10;the ashpits, to the dark odorous stables where a coachman smoothed&#10;and combed the horse or shook music from the buckled harness. When&#10;we returned to the street, light from the kitchen windows had&#10;filled the areas. If my uncle was seen turning the corner, we hid&#10;in the shadow until we had seen him safely housed. Or if Mangan&#39;s&#10;sister came out on the doorstep to call her brother in to his tea,&#10;we watched her from our shadow peer up and down the street. We&#10;waited to see whether she would remain or go in and, if she&#10;remained, we left our shadow and walked up to Mangan&#39;s steps&#10;resignedly. She was waiting for us, her figure defined by the light&#10;from the half-opened door. Her brother always teased her before he&#10;obeyed, and I stood by the railings looking at her. Her dress swung&#10;as she moved her body, and the soft rope of her hair tossed from&#10;side to side.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Every morning I lay on the floor in the front parlour watching&#10;her door. The blind was pulled down to within an inch of the sash&#10;so that I could not be seen. When she came out on the doorstep my&#10;heart leaped. I ran to the hall, seized my books and followed her.&#10;I kept her brown figure always in my eye and, when we came near the&#10;point at which our ways diverged, I quickened my pace and passed&#10;her. This happened morning after morning. I had never spoken to&#10;her, except for a few casual words, and yet her name was like a&#10;summons to all my foolish blood.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Her image accompanied me even in places the most hostile to&#10;romance. On Saturday evenings when my aunt went marketing I had to&#10;go to carry some of the parcels. We walked through the flaring&#10;streets, jostled by drunken men and bargaining women, amid the&#10;curses of labourers, the shrill litanies of shop-boys who stood on&#10;guard by the barrels of pigs&#39; cheeks, the nasal chanting of&#10;street-singers, who sang a come-all-you about O&#39;Donovan Rossa, or a&#10;ballad about the troubles in our native land. These noises&#10;converged in a single sensation of life for me: I imagined that I&#10;bore my chalice safely through a throng of foes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Her name sprang to my lips at moments in strange prayers and&#10;praises which I myself did not understand. My eyes were often full&#10;of tears (I could not tell why) and at times a flood from my heart&#10;seemed to pour itself out into my bosom. I thought little of the&#10;future. I did not know whether I would ever speak to her or not or,&#10;if I spoke to her, how I could tell her of my confused adoration.&#10;But my body was like a harp and her words and gestures were like&#10;fingers running upon the wires.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;One evening I went into the back drawing-room in which the&#10;priest had died. It was a dark rainy evening and there was no sound&#10;in the house. Through one of the broken panes I heard the rain&#10;impinge upon the earth, the fine incessant needles of water playing&#10;in the sodden beds. Some distant lamp or lighted window gleamed&#10;below me. I was thankful that I could see so little. All my senses&#10;seemed to desire to veil themselves and, feeling that I was about&#10;to slip from them, I pressed the palms of my hands together until&#10;they trembled, murmuring: &#39;O love! O love!&#39; many times.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At last she spoke to me. When she addressed the first words to&#10;me I was so confused that I did not know what to answer. She asked&#10;me was I going to Araby. I forgot whether I answered yes or no. It&#10;would be a splendid bazaar; she said she would love to go.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;And why can&#39;t you?&#39; I asked.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;While she spoke she turned a silver bracelet round and round her&#10;wrist. She could not go, she said, because there would be a retreat&#10;that week in her convent. Her brother and two other boys were&#10;fighting for their caps, and I was alone at the railings. She held&#10;one of the spikes, bowing her head towards me. The light from the&#10;lamp opposite our door caught the white curve of her neck, lit up&#10;her hair that rested there and, falling, lit up the hand upon the&#10;railing. At fell over one side of her dress and caught the white&#10;border of a petticoat, just visible as she stood at ease.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;It&#39;s well for you,&#39; she said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;If I go,&#39; I said, `I will bring you something.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;What innumerable follies laid waste my waking and sleeping&#10;thoughts after that evening! I wished to annihilate the tedious&#10;intervening days. I chafed against the work of school. At night in&#10;my bedroom and by day in the classroom her image came between me&#10;and the page I strove to read. The syllables of the word Araby were&#10;called to me through the silence in which my soul luxuriated and&#10;cast an Eastern enchantment over me. I asked for leave to go to the&#10;bazaar on Saturday night. My aunt was surprised, and hoped it was&#10;not some Freemason affair. I answered few questions in class. I&#10;watched my master&#39;s face pass from amiability to sternness; he&#10;hoped I was not beginning to idle. I could not call my wandering&#10;thoughts together. I had hardly any patience with the serious work&#10;of life which, now that it stood between me and my desire, seemed&#10;to me child&#39;s play, ugly monotonous child&#39;s play.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;On Saturday morning I reminded my uncle that I wished to go to&#10;the bazaar in the evening. He was fussing at the hallstand, looking&#10;for the hat-brush, and answered me curtly:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Yes, boy, I know.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As he was in the hall I could not go into the front parlour and&#10;lie at the window. I felt the house in bad humour and walked slowly&#10;towards the school. The air was pitilessly raw and already my heart&#10;misgave me. When I came home to dinner my uncle had not yet been&#10;home. Still it was early. I sat staring at the clock for some time&#10;and, when its ticking began to irritate me, I left the room. I&#10;mounted the staircase and gained the upper part of the house. The&#10;high, cold, empty, gloomy rooms liberated me and I went from room&#10;to room singing. From the front window I saw my companions playing&#10;below in the street. Their cries reached me weakened and indistinct&#10;and, leaning my forehead against the cool glass, I looked over at&#10;the dark house where she lived. I may have stood there for an hour,&#10;seeing nothing but the brown-clad figure cast by my imagination,&#10;touched discreetly by the lamplight at the curved neck, at the hand&#10;upon the railings and at the border below the dress.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When I came downstairs again I found Mrs Mercer sitting at the&#10;fire. She was an old, garrulous woman, a pawnbroker&#39;s widow, who&#10;collected used stamps for some pious purpose. I had to endure the&#10;gossip of the tea-table. The meal was prolonged beyond an hour and&#10;still my uncle did not come. Mrs Mercer stood up to go: she was&#10;sorry she couldn&#39;t wait any longer, but it was after eight o&#39;clock&#10;and she did not like to be out late, as the night air was bad for&#10;her. When she had gone I began to walk up and down the room,&#10;clenching my fists. My aunt said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;I&#39;m afraid you may put off your bazaar for this night of Our&#10;Lord.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At nine o&#39;clock I heard my uncle&#39;s latchkey in the hall door. I&#10;heard him talking to himself and heard the hallstand rocking when&#10;it had received the weight of his overcoat. I could interpret these&#10;signs. When he was midway through his dinner I asked him to give me&#10;the money to go to the bazaar. He had forgotten.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;The people are in bed and after their first sleep now,&#39; he&#10;said. I did not smile. My aunt said to him energetically:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Can&#39;t you give him the money and let him go? You&#39;ve kept him&#10;late enough as it is.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;My uncle said he was very sorry he had forgotten. He said he&#10;believed in the old saying: &#39;All work and no play makes Jack a dull&#10;boy.&#39; He asked me where I was going and, when I told him a second&#10;time, he asked me did I know The Arab&#39;s Farewell to his Steed. When&#10;I left the kitchen he was about to recite the opening lines of the&#10;piece to my aunt.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I held a florin tightly in my hand as I strode down Buckingham&#10;Street towards the station. The sight of the streets thronged with&#10;buyers and glaring with gas recalled to me the purpose of my&#10;journey. I took my seat in a third-class carriage of a deserted&#10;train. After an intolerable delay the train moved out of the&#10;station slowly. It crept onward among ruinous houses and over the&#10;twinkling river. At Westland Row Station a crowd of people pressed&#10;to the carriage doors; but the porters moved them back, saying that&#10;it was a special train for the bazaar. I remained alone in the bare&#10;carriage. In a few minutes the train drew up beside an improvised&#10;wooden platform. I passed out on to the road and saw by the lighted&#10;dial of a clock that it was ten minutes to ten. In front of me was&#10;a large building which displayed the magical name.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I could not find any sixpenny entrance and, fearing that the&#10;bazaar would be closed, I passed in quickly through a turnstile,&#10;handing a shilling to a weary-looking man. I found myself in a big&#10;hall girded at half its height by a gallery. Nearly all the stalls&#10;were closed and the greater part of the hall was in darkness. I&#10;recognized a silence like that which pervades a church after a&#10;service. I walked into the centre of the bazaar timidly. A few&#10;people were gathered about the stalls which were still open. Before&#10;a curtain, over which the words Caf&#233; Chantant were written in&#10;coloured lamps, two men were counting money on a salver. I listened&#10;to the fall of the coins. Remembering with difficulty why I had&#10;come, I went over to one of the stalls and examined porcelain vases&#10;and flowered tea-sets. At the door of the stall a young lady was&#10;talking and laughing with two young gentlemen. I remarked their&#10;English accents and listened vaguely to their conversation.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;O, I never said such a thing!&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;O, but you did!&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;O, but I didn&#39;t!&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Didn&#39;t she say that?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Yes. I heard her.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;O, there&#39;s a&#8230; fib!&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Observing me, the young lady came over and asked me did I wish&#10;to buy anything. The tone of her voice was not encouraging; she&#10;seemed to have spoken to me out of a sense of duty. I looked humbly&#10;at the great jars that stood like eastern guards at either side of&#10;the dark entrance to the stall and murmured:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;No, thank you.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The young lady changed the position of one of the vases and went&#10;back to the two young men. They began to talk of the same subject.&#10;Once or twice the young lady glanced at me over her shoulder. I&#10;lingered before her stall, though I knew my stay was useless, to&#10;make my interest in her wares seem the more real. Then I turned&#10;away slowly and walked down the middle of the bazaar. I allowed the&#10;two pennies to fall against the sixpence in my pocket. I heard a&#10;voice call from one end of the gallery that the light was out. The&#10;upper part of the hall was now completely dark.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Gazing up into the darkness I saw myself as a creature driven&#10;and derided by vanity; and my eyes burned with anguish and&#10;anger.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 8, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/5', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;Eveline'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;She sat at the window watching the evening invade the avenue.&#10;Her head was leaned against the window curtains and in her nostrils&#10;was the odour of dusty cretonne. She was tired.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Few people passed. The man out of the last house passed on his&#10;way home; she heard his footsteps clacking along the concrete&#10;pavement and afterwards crunching on the cinder path before the new&#10;red houses. One time there used to be a field there in which they&#10;used to play every evening with other people&#39;s children. Then a man&#10;from Belfast bought the field and built houses in it&#8212;not like their&#10;little brown houses but bright brick houses with shining roofs. The&#10;children of the avenue used to play together in that field &#8212;the&#10;Devines, the Waters, the Dunns, little Keogh the cripple, she and&#10;her brothers and sisters. Ernest, however, never played: he was too&#10;grown up. Her father used often to hunt them in out of the field&#10;with his blackthorn stick; but usually little Keogh used to keep&#10;nix and call out when he saw her father coming. Still they seemed&#10;to have been rather happy then. Her father was not so bad then; and&#10;besides, her mother was alive. That was a long time ago; she and&#10;her brothers and sisters were all grown up her mother was dead.&#10;Tizzie Dunn was dead, too, and the Waters had gone back to England.&#10;Everything changes. Now she was going to go away like the others,&#10;to leave her home.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Home! She looked round the room, reviewing all its familiar&#10;objects which she had dusted once a week for so many years,&#10;wondering where on earth all the dust came from. Perhaps she would&#10;never see again those familiar objects from which she had never&#10;dreamed of being divided. And yet during all those years she had&#10;never found out the name of the priest whose yellowing photograph&#10;hung on the wall above the broken harmonium beside the coloured&#10;print of the promises made to Blessed Margaret Mary Alacoque. He&#10;had been a school friend of her father. Whenever he showed the&#10;photograph to a visitor her father used to pass it with a casual&#10;word:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;He is in Melbourne now.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She had consented to go away, to leave her home. Was that wise?&#10;She tried to weigh each side of the question. In her home anyway&#10;she had shelter and food; she had those whom she had known all her&#10;life about her. O course she had to work hard, both in the house&#10;and at business. What would they say of her in the Stores when they&#10;found out that she had run away with a fellow? Say she was a fool,&#10;perhaps; and her place would be filled up by advertisement. Miss&#10;Gavan would be glad. She had always had an edge on her, especially&#10;whenever there were people listening.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Miss Hill, don&#39;t you see these ladies are waiting?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Look lively, Miss Hill, please.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She would not cry many tears at leaving the Stores.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But in her new home, in a distant unknown country, it would not&#10;be like that. Then she would be married&#8212;she, Eveline. People would&#10;treat her with respect then. She would not be treated as her mother&#10;had been. Even now, though she was over nineteen, she sometimes&#10;felt herself in danger of her father&#39;s violence. She knew it was&#10;that that had given her the palpitations. When they were growing up&#10;he had never gone for her like he used to go for Harry and Ernest,&#10;because she was a girl but latterly he had begun to threaten her&#10;and say what he would do to her only for her dead mother&#39;s sake.&#10;And no she had nobody to protect her. Ernest was dead and Harry,&#10;who was in the church decorating business, was nearly always down&#10;somewhere in the country. Besides, the invariable squabble for&#10;money on Saturday nights had begun to weary her unspeakably. She&#10;always gave her entire wages&#8212;seven shillings&#8212;and Harry always sent&#10;up what he could but the trouble was to get any money from her&#10;father. He said she used to squander the money, that she had no&#10;head, that he wasn&#39;t going to give her his hard-earned money to&#10;throw about the streets, and much more, for he was usually fairly&#10;bad on Saturday night. In the end he would give her the money and&#10;ask her had she any intention of buying Sunday&#39;s dinner. Then she&#10;had to rush out as quickly as she could and do her marketing,&#10;holding her black leather purse tightly in her hand as she elbowed&#10;her way through the crowds and returning home late under her load&#10;of provisions. She had hard work to keep the house together and to&#10;see that the two young children who had been left to hr charge went&#10;to school regularly and got their meals regularly. It was hard&#10;work&#8212;a hard life&#8212;but now that she was about to leave it she did not&#10;find it a wholly undesirable life.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She was about to explore another life with Frank. Frank was very&#10;kind, manly, open-hearted. She was to go away with him by the&#10;night-boat to be his wife and to live with him in Buenos Ayres&#10;where he had a home waiting for her. How well she remembered the&#10;first time she had seen him; he was lodging in a house on the main&#10;road where she used to visit. It seemed a few weeks ago. He was&#10;standing at the gate, his peaked cap pushed back on his head and&#10;his hair tumbled forward over a face of bronze. Then they had come&#10;to know each other. He used to meet her outside the Stores every&#10;evening and see her home. He took her to see The Bohemian Girl and&#10;she felt elated as she sat in an unaccustomed part of the theatre&#10;with him. He was awfully fond of music and sang a little. People&#10;knew that they were courting and, when he sang about the lass that&#10;loves a sailor, she always felt pleasantly confused. He used to&#10;call her Poppens out of fun. First of all it had been an excitement&#10;for her to have a fellow and then she had begun to like him. He had&#10;tales of distant countries. He had started as a deck boy at a pound&#10;a month on a ship of the Allan Line going out to Canada. He told&#10;her the names of the ships he had been on and the names of the&#10;different services. He had sailed through the Straits of Magellan&#10;and he told her stories of the terrible Patagonians. He had fallen&#10;on his feet in Buenos Ayres, he said, and had come over to the old&#10;country just for a holiday. Of course, her father had found out the&#10;affair and had forbidden her to have anything to say to him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I know these sailor chaps,&#34; he said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;One day he had quarrelled with Frank and after that she had to&#10;meet her lover secretly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The evening deepened in the avenue. The white of two letters in&#10;her lap grew indistinct. One was to Harry; the other was to her&#10;father. Ernest had been her favourite but she liked Harry too. Her&#10;father was becoming old lately, she noticed; he would miss her.&#10;Sometimes he could be very nice. Not long before, when she had been&#10;laid up for a day, he had read her out a ghost story and made toast&#10;for her at the fire. Another day, when their mother was alive, they&#10;had all gone for a picnic to the Hill of Howth. She remembered her&#10;father putting on her mothers bonnet to make the children&#10;laugh.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Her time was running out but she continued to sit by the window,&#10;leaning her head against the window curtain, inhaling the odour of&#10;dusty cretonne. Down far in the avenue she could hear a street&#10;organ playing. She knew the air Strange that it should come that&#10;very night to remind her of the promise to her mother, her promise&#10;to keep the home together as long as she could. She remembered the&#10;last night of her mother&#39;s illness; she was again in the close dark&#10;room at the other side of the hall and outside she heard a&#10;melancholy air of Italy. The organ-player had been ordered to go&#10;away and given sixpence. She remembered her father strutting back&#10;into the sickroom saying:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Damned Italians! coming over here!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As she mused the pitiful vision of her mother&#39;s life laid its&#10;spell on the very quick of her being&#8212;that life of commonplace&#10;sacrifices closing in final craziness. She trembled as she heard&#10;again her mother&#39;s voice saying constantly with foolish&#10;insistence:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Derevaun Seraun! Derevaun Seraun!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She stood up in a sudden impulse of terror. Escape! She must&#10;escape! Frank would save her. He would give her life, perhaps love,&#10;too. But she wanted to live. Why should she be unhappy? She had a&#10;right to happiness. Frank would take her in his arms, fold her in&#10;his arms. He would save her.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She stood among the swaying crowd in the station at the North&#10;Wall. He held her hand and she knew that he was speaking to her,&#10;saying something about the passage over and over again. The station&#10;was full of soldiers with brown baggages. Through the wide doors of&#10;the sheds she caught a glimpse of the black mass of the boat, lying&#10;in beside the quay wall, with illumined portholes. She answered&#10;nothing. She felt her cheek pale and cold and, out of a maze of&#10;distress, she prayed to God to direct her, to show her what was her&#10;duty. The boat blew a long mournful whistle into the mist. If she&#10;went, tomorrow she would be on the sea with Frank, steaming towards&#10;Buenos Ayres. Their passage had been booked. Could she still draw&#10;back after all he had done for her? Her distress awoke a nausea in&#10;her body and she kept moving her lips in silent fervent prayer.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A bell clanged upon her heart. She felt him seize her hand:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Come!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;All the seas of the world tumbled about her heart. He was&#10;drawing her into them: he would drown her. She gripped with both&#10;hands at the iron railing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Come!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;No! No! No! It was impossible. Her hands clutched the iron in&#10;frenzy. Amid the seas she sent a cry of anguish.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Eveline! Evvy!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He rushed beyond the barrier and called to her to follow. He was&#10;shouted at to go on but he still called to her. She set her white&#10;face to him, passive, like a helpless animal. Her eyes gave him no&#10;sign of love or farewell or recognition.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 8, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/5', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;After the Race'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;The cars came scudding in towards Dublin, running evenly like&#10;pellets in the groove of the Naas Road. At the crest of the hill at&#10;Inchicore sightseers had gathered in clumps to watch the cars&#10;careering homeward and through this channel of poverty and inaction&#10;the Continent sped its wealth and industry. Now and again the&#10;clumps of people raised the cheer of the gratefully oppressed.&#10;Their sympathy, however, was for the blue cars&#8212;the cars of their&#10;friends, the French.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The French, moreover, were virtual victors. Their team had&#10;finished solidly; they had been placed second and third and the&#10;driver of the winning German car was reported a Belgian. Each blue&#10;car, therefore, received a double measure of welcome as it topped&#10;the crest of the hill and each cheer of welcome was acknowledged&#10;with smiles and nods by those in the car. In one of these trimly&#10;built cars was a party of four young men whose spirits seemed to be&#10;at present well above the level of successful Gallicism: in fact,&#10;these four young men were almost hilarious. They were Charles&#10;Segouin, the owner of the car; Andre Riviere, a young electrician&#10;of Canadian birth; a huge Hungarian named Villona and a neatly&#10;groomed young man named Doyle. Segouin was in good humour because&#10;he had unexpectedly received some orders in advance (he was about&#10;to start a motor establishment in Paris) and Riviere was in good&#10;humour because he was to be appointed manager of the establishment;&#10;these two young men (who were cousins) were also in good humour&#10;because of the success of the French cars. Villona was in good&#10;humour because he had had a very satisfactory luncheon; and besides&#10;he was an optimist by nature. The fourth member of the party,&#10;however, was too excited to be genuinely happy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He was about twenty-six years of age, with a soft, light brown&#10;moustache and rather innocent-looking grey eyes. His father, who&#10;had begun life as an advanced Nationalist, had modified his views&#10;early. He had made his money as a butcher in Kingstown and by&#10;opening shops in Dublin and in the suburbs he had made his money&#10;many times over. He had also been fortunate enough to secure some&#10;of the police contracts and in the end he had become rich enough to&#10;be alluded to in the Dublin newspapers as a merchant prince. He had&#10;sent his son to England to be educated in a big Catholic college&#10;and had afterwards sent him to Dublin University to study law.&#10;Jimmy did not study very earnestly and took to bad courses for a&#10;while. He had money and he was popular; and he divided his time&#10;curiously between musical and motoring circles. Then he had been&#10;sent for a term to Cambridge to see a little life. His father,&#10;remonstrative, but covertly proud of the excess, had paid his bills&#10;and brought him home. It was at Cambridge that he had met Segouin.&#10;They were not much more than acquaintances as yet but Jimmy found&#10;great pleasure in the society of one who had seen so much of the&#10;world and was reputed to own some of the biggest hotels in France.&#10;Such a person (as his father agreed) was well worth knowing, even&#10;if he had not been the charming companion he was. Villona was&#10;entertaining also&#8212;a brilliant pianist&#8212;but, unfortunately, very&#10;poor.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The car ran on merrily with its cargo of hilarious youth. The&#10;two cousins sat on the front seat; Jimmy and his Hungarian friend&#10;sat behind. Decidedly Villona was in excellent spirits; he kept up&#10;a deep bass hum of melody for miles of the road The Frenchmen flung&#10;their laughter and light words over their shoulders and often Jimmy&#10;had to strain forward to catch the quick phrase. This was not&#10;altogether pleasant for him, as he had nearly always to make a deft&#10;guess at the meaning and shout back a suitable answer in the face&#10;of a high wind. Besides Villona&#39;s humming would confuse anybody;&#10;the noise of the car, too.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Rapid motion through space elates one; so does notoriety; so&#10;does the possession of money. These were three good reasons for&#10;Jimmy&#39;s excitement. He had been seen by many of his friends that&#10;day in the company of these Continentals. At the control Segouin&#10;had presented him to one of the French competitors and, in answer&#10;to his confused murmur of compliment, the swarthy face of the&#10;driver had disclosed a line of shining white teeth. It was pleasant&#10;after that honour to return to the profane world of spectators amid&#10;nudges and significant looks. Then as to money&#8212;he really had a&#10;great sum under his control. Segouin, perhaps, would not think it a&#10;great sum but Jimmy who, in spite of temporary errors, was at heart&#10;the inheritor of solid instincts knew well with what difficulty it&#10;had been got together. This knowledge had previously kept his bills&#10;within the limits of reasonable recklessness, and if he had been so&#10;conscious of the labour latent in money when there had been&#10;question merely of some freak of the higher intelligence, how much&#10;more so now when he was about to stake the greater part of his&#10;substance! It was a serious thing for him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Of course, the investment was a good one and Segouin had managed&#10;to give the impression that it was by a favour of friendship the&#10;mite of Irish money was to be included in the capital of the&#10;concern. Jimmy had a respect for his father&#39;s shrewdness in&#10;business matters and in this case it had been his father who had&#10;first suggested the investment; money to be made in the motor&#10;business, pots of money. Moreover Segouin had the unmistakable air&#10;of wealth. Jimmy set out to translate into days&#39; work that lordly&#10;car in which he sat. How smoothly it ran. In what style they had&#10;come careering along the country roads! The journey laid a magical&#10;finger on the genuine pulse of life and gallantly the machinery of&#10;human nerves strove to answer the bounding courses of the swift&#10;blue animal.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;They drove down Dame Street. The street was busy with unusual&#10;traffic, loud with the horns of motorists and the gongs of&#10;impatient tram-drivers. Near the Bank Segouin drew up and Jimmy and&#10;his friend alighted. A little knot of people collected on the&#10;footpath to pay homage to the snorting motor. The party was to dine&#10;together that evening in Segouin&#39;s hotel and, meanwhile, Jimmy and&#10;his friend, who was staying with him, were to go home to dress. The&#10;car steered out slowly for Grafton Street while the two young men&#10;pushed their way through the knot of gazers. They walked northward&#10;with a curious feeling of disappointment in the exercise, while the&#10;city hung its pale globes of light above them in a haze of summer&#10;evening.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In Jimmy&#39;s house this dinner had been pronounced an occasion. A&#10;certain pride mingled with his parents&#39; trepidation, a certain&#10;eagerness, also, to play fast and loose for the names of great&#10;foreign cities have at least this virtue. Jimmy, too, looked very&#10;well when he was dressed and, as he stood in the hall giving a last&#10;equation to the bows of his dress tie, his father may have felt&#10;even commercially satisfied at having secured for his son qualities&#10;often unpurchaseable. His father, therefore, was unusually friendly&#10;with Villona and his manner expressed a real respect for foreign&#10;accomplishments; but this subtlety of his host was probably lost&#10;upon the Hungarian, who was beginning to have a sharp desire for&#10;his dinner.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The dinner was excellent, exquisite. Segouin, Jimmy decided, had&#10;a very refined taste. The party was increased by a young Englishman&#10;named Routh whom Jimmy had seen with Segouin at Cambridge. The&#10;young men supped in a snug room lit by electric candle lamps. They&#10;talked volubly and with little reserve. Jimmy, whose imagination&#10;was kindling, conceived the lively youth of the Frenchmen twined&#10;elegantly upon the firm framework of the Englishman&#39;s manner. A&#10;graceful image of his, he thought, and a just one. He admired the&#10;dexterity with which their host directed the conversation. The five&#10;young men had various tastes and their tongues had been loosened.&#10;Villona, with immense respect, began to discover to the mildly&#10;surprised Englishman the beauties of the English madrigal,&#10;deploring the loss of old instruments. Riviere, not wholly&#10;ingenuously, undertook to explain to Jimmy the triumph of the&#10;French mechanicians. The resonant voice of the Hungarian was about&#10;to prevail in ridicule of the spurious lutes of the romantic&#10;painters when Segouin shepherded his party into politics. Here was&#10;congenial ground for all. Jimmy, under generous influences, felt&#10;the buried zeal of his father wake to life within him: he aroused&#10;the torpid Routh at last. The room grew doubly hot and Segouin&#39;s&#10;task grew harder each moment: there was even danger of personal&#10;spite. The alert host at an opportunity lifted his glass to&#10;Humanity and, when the toast had been drunk, he threw open a window&#10;significantly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;That night the city wore the mask of a capital. The five young&#10;men strolled along Stephen&#39;s Green in a faint cloud of aromatic&#10;smoke. They talked loudly and gaily and their cloaks dangled from&#10;their shoulders. The people made way for them. At the corner of&#10;Grafton Street a short fat man was putting two handsome ladies on a&#10;car in charge of another fat man. The car drove off and the short&#10;fat man caught sight of the party.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Andre.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It&#39;s Farley!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A torrent of talk followed. Farley was an American. No one knew&#10;very well what the talk was about. Villona and Riviere were the&#10;noisiest, but all the men were excited. They got up on a car,&#10;squeezing themselves together amid much laughter. They drove by the&#10;crowd, blended now into soft colours, to a music of merry bells.&#10;They took the train at Westland Row and in a few seconds, as it&#10;seemed to Jimmy, they were walking out of Kingstown Station. The&#10;ticket-collector saluted Jimmy; he was an old man:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Fine night, sir!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was a serene summer night; the harbour lay like a darkened&#10;mirror at their feet. They proceeded towards it with linked arms,&#10;singing Cadet Roussel in chorus, stamping their feet at every:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ho! Ho! Hohe, vraiment!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;They got into a rowboat at the slip and made out for the&#10;American&#39;s yacht. There was to be supper, music, cards. Villona&#10;said with conviction:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It is delightful!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There was a yacht piano in the cabin. Villona played a waltz for&#10;Farley and Riviere, Farley acting as cavalier and Riviere as lady.&#10;Then an impromptu square dance, the men devising original figures.&#10;What merriment! Jimmy took his part with a will; this was seeing&#10;life, at least. Then Farley got out of breath and cried &#34;Stop!&#34; A&#10;man brought in a light supper, and the young men sat down to it for&#10;form&#39;s sake. They drank, however: it was Bohemian. They drank&#10;Ireland, England, France, Hungary, the United States of America.&#10;Jimmy made a speech, a long speech, Villona saying: &#34;Hear! hear!&#34;&#10;whenever there was a pause. There was a great clapping of hands&#10;when he sat down. It must have been a good speech. Farley clapped&#10;him on the back and laughed loudly. What jovial fellows! What good&#10;company they were!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Cards! cards! The table was cleared. Villona returned quietly to&#10;his piano and played voluntaries for them. The other men played&#10;game after game, flinging themselves boldly into the adventure.&#10;They drank the health of the Queen of Hearts and of the Queen of&#10;Diamonds. Jimmy felt obscurely the lack of an audience: the wit was&#10;flashing. Play ran very high and paper began to pass. Jimmy did not&#10;know exactly who was winning but he knew that he was losing. But it&#10;was his own fault for he frequently mistook his cards and the other&#10;men had to calculate his I.O.U.&#39;s for him. They were devils of&#10;fellows but he wished they would stop: it was getting late. Someone&#10;gave the toast of the yacht The Belle of Newport and then someone&#10;proposed one great game for a finish.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The piano had stopped; Villona must have gone up on deck. It was&#10;a terrible game. They stopped just before the end of it to drink&#10;for luck. Jimmy understood that the game lay between Routh and&#10;Segouin. What excitement! Jimmy was excited too; he would lose, of&#10;course. How much had he written away? The men rose to their feet to&#10;play the last tricks. talking and gesticulating. Routh won. The&#10;cabin shook with the young men&#39;s cheering and the cards were&#10;bundled together. They began then to gather in what they had won.&#10;Farley and Jimmy were the heaviest losers.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He knew that he would regret in the morning but at present he&#10;was glad of the rest, glad of the dark stupor that would cover up&#10;his folly. He leaned his elbows on the table and rested his head&#10;between his hands, counting the beats of his temples. The cabin&#10;door opened and he saw the Hungarian standing in a shaft of grey&#10;light:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Daybreak, gentlemen!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 8, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/5', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;Two Gallants'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;The grey warm evening of August had descended upon the city and&#10;a mild warm air, a memory of summer, circulated in the streets. The&#10;streets, shuttered for the repose of Sunday, swarmed with a gaily&#10;coloured crowd. Like illumined pearls the lamps shone from the&#10;summits of their tall poles upon the living texture below which,&#10;changing shape and hue unceasingly, sent up into the warm grey&#10;evening air an unchanging unceasing murmur.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Two young men came down the hill of Rutland Square. On of them&#10;was just bringing a long monologue to a close. The other, who&#10;walked on the verge of the path and was at times obliged to step on&#10;to the road, owing to his companion&#39;s rudeness, wore an amused&#10;listening face. He was squat and ruddy. A yachting cap was shoved&#10;far back from his forehead and the narrative to which he listened&#10;made constant waves of expression break forth over his face from&#10;the corners of his nose and eyes and mouth. Little jets of wheezing&#10;laughter followed one another out of his convulsed body. His eyes,&#10;twinkling with cunning enjoyment, glanced at every moment towards&#10;his companion&#39;s face. Once or twice he rearranged the light&#10;waterproof which he had slung over one shoulder in toreador&#10;fashion. His breeches, his white rubber shoes and his jauntily&#10;slung waterproof expressed youth. But his figure fell into&#10;rotundity at the waist, his hair was scant and grey and his face,&#10;when the waves of expression had passed over it, had a ravaged&#10;look.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When he was quite sure that the narrative had ended he laughed&#10;noiselessly for fully half a minute. Then he said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well!&#8230; That takes the biscuit!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;His voice seemed winnowed of vigour; and to enforce his words he&#10;added with humour:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That takes the solitary, unique, and, if I may so call it,&#10;recherche biscuit! &#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He became serious and silent when he had said this. His tongue&#10;was tired for he had been talking all the afternoon in a&#10;public-house in Dorset Street. Most people considered Lenehan a&#10;leech but, in spite of this reputation, his adroitness and&#10;eloquence had always prevented his friends from forming any general&#10;policy against him. He had a brave manner of coming up to a party&#10;of them in a bar and of holding himself nimbly at the borders of&#10;the company until he was included in a round. He was a sporting&#10;vagrant armed with a vast stock of stories, limericks and riddles.&#10;He was insensitive to all kinds of discourtesy. No one knew how he&#10;achieved the stern task of living, but his name was vaguely&#10;associated with racing tissues.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And where did you pick her up, Corley?&#34; he asked.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Corley ran his tongue swiftly along his upper lip.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;One night, man,&#34; he said, &#34;I was going along Dame Street and I&#10;spotted a fine tart under Waterhouse&#39;s clock and said good- night,&#10;you know. So we went for a walk round by the canal and she told me&#10;she was a slavey in a house in Baggot Street. I put my arm round&#10;her and squeezed her a bit that night. Then next Sunday, man, I met&#10;her by appointment. We vent out to Donnybrook and I brought her&#10;into a field there. She told me she used to go with a dairyman&#8230; .&#10;It was fine, man. Cigarettes every night she&#39;d bring me and paying&#10;the tram out and back. And one night she brought me two bloody fine&#10;cigars&#8212;O, the real cheese, you know, that the old fellow used to&#10;smoke&#8230; . I was afraid, man, she&#39;d get in the family way. But she&#39;s&#10;up to the dodge.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Maybe she thinks you&#39;ll marry her,&#34; said Lenehan.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I told her I was out of a job,&#34; said Corley. &#34;I told her I was&#10;in Pim&#39;s. She doesn&#39;t know my name. I was too hairy to tell her&#10;that. But she thinks I&#39;m a bit of class, you know.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Lenehan laughed again, noiselessly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Of all the good ones ever I heard,&#34; he said, &#34;that emphatically&#10;takes the biscuit.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Corley&#39;s stride acknowledged the compliment. The swing of his&#10;burly body made his friend execute a few light skips from the path&#10;to the roadway and back again. Corley was the son of an inspector&#10;of police and he had inherited his father&#39;s frame and gut. He&#10;walked with his hands by his sides, holding himself erect and&#10;swaying his head from side to side. His head was large, globular&#10;and oily; it sweated in all weathers; and his large round hat, set&#10;upon it sideways, looked like a bulb which had grown out of&#10;another. He always stared straight before him as if he were on&#10;parade and, when he wished to gaze after someone in the street, it&#10;was necessary for him to move his body from the hips. At present he&#10;was about town. Whenever any job was vacant a friend was always&#10;ready to give him the hard word. He was often to be seen walking&#10;with policemen in plain clothes, talking earnestly. He knew the&#10;inner side of all affairs and was fond of delivering final&#10;judgments. He spoke without listening to the speech of his&#10;companions. His conversation was mainly about himself what he had&#10;said to such a person and what such a person had said to him and&#10;what he had said to settle the matter. When he reported these&#10;dialogues he aspirated the first letter of his name after the&#10;manner of Florentines.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Lenehan offered his friend a cigarette. As the two young men&#10;walked on through the crowd Corley occasionally turned to smile at&#10;some of the passing girls but Lenehan&#39;s gaze was fixed on the large&#10;faint moon circled with a double halo. He watched earnestly the&#10;passing of the grey web of twilight across its face. At length he&#10;said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well&#8230; tell me, Corley, I suppose you&#39;ll be able to pull it off&#10;all right, eh?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Corley closed one eye expressively as an answer.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Is she game for that?&#34; asked Lenehan dubiously. &#34;You can never&#10;know women.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;She&#39;s all right,&#34; said Corley. &#34;I know the way to get around&#10;her, man. She&#39;s a bit gone on me.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You&#39;re what I call a gay Lothario,&#34; said Lenehan. &#34;And the&#10;proper kind of a Lothario, too!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A shade of mockery relieved the servility of his manner. To save&#10;himself he had the habit of leaving his flattery open to the&#10;interpretation of raillery. But Corley had not a subtle mind.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;There&#39;s nothing to touch a good slavey,&#34; he affirmed. &#34;Take my&#10;tip for it.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;By one who has tried them all,&#34; said Lenehan.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;First I used to go with girls, you know,&#34; said Corley,&#10;unbosoming; &#34;girls off the South Circular. I used to take them out,&#10;man, on the tram somewhere and pay the tram or take them to a band&#10;or a play at the theatre or buy them chocolate and sweets or&#10;something that way. I used to spend money on them right enough,&#34; he&#10;added, in a convincing tone, as if he was conscious of being&#10;disbelieved.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But Lenehan could well believe it; he nodded gravely.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I know that game,&#34; he said, &#34;and it&#39;s a mug&#39;s game.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And damn the thing I ever got out of it,&#34; said Corley.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ditto here,&#34; said Lenehan.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Only off of one of them,&#34; said Corley.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He moistened his upper lip by running his tongue along it. The&#10;recollection brightened his eyes. He too gazed at the pale disc of&#10;the moon, now nearly veiled, and seemed to meditate.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She was&#8230; a bit of all right,&#34; he said regretfully.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He was silent again. Then he added:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;She&#39;s on the turf now. I saw her driving down Earl Street one&#10;night with two fellows with her on a car.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I suppose that&#39;s your doing,&#34; said Lenehan.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;There was others at her before me,&#34; said Corley&#10;philosophically.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;This time Lenehan was inclined to disbelieve. He shook his head&#10;to and fro and smiled.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You know you can&#39;t kid me, Corley,&#34; he said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Honest to God!&#34; said Corley. &#34;Didn&#39;t she tell me herself?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Lenehan made a tragic gesture.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Base betrayer!&#34; he said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As they passed along the railings of Trinity College, Lenehan&#10;skipped out into the road and peered up at the clock.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Twenty after,&#34; he said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Time enough,&#34; said Corley. &#34;She&#39;ll be there all right. I always&#10;let her wait a bit.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Lenehan laughed quietly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Ecod! Corley, you know how to take them,&#34; he said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I&#39;m up to all their little tricks,&#34; Corley confessed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But tell me,&#34; said Lenehan again, &#34;are you sure you can bring&#10;it off all right? You know it&#39;s a ticklish job. They&#39;re damn close&#10;on that point. Eh?&#38;#160;&#8230; What?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;His bright, small eyes searched his companion&#39;s face for&#10;reassurance. Corley swung his head to and fro as if to toss aside&#10;an insistent insect, and his brows gathered.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I&#39;ll pull it off,&#34; he said. &#34;Leave it to me, can&#39;t you?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Lenehan said no more. He did not wish to ruffle his friend&#39;s&#10;temper, to be sent to the devil and told that his advice was not&#10;wanted. A little tact was necessary. But Corley&#39;s brow was soon&#10;smooth again. His thoughts were running another way.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;She&#39;s a fine decent tart,&#34; he said, with appreciation; &#34;that&#39;s&#10;what she is.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;They walked along Nassau Street and then turned into Kildare&#10;Street. Not far from the porch of the club a harpist stood in the&#10;roadway, playing to a little ring of listeners. He plucked at the&#10;wires heedlessly, glancing quickly from time to time at the face of&#10;each new-comer and from time to time, wearily also, at the sky. His&#10;harp, too, heedless that her coverings had fallen about her knees,&#10;seemed weary alike of the eyes of strangers and of her master&#39;s&#10;hands. One hand played in the bass the melody of Silent, O Moyle,&#10;while the other hand careered in the treble after each group of&#10;notes. The notes of the air sounded deep and full.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The two young men walked up the street without speaking, the&#10;mournful music following them. When they reached Stephen&#39;s Green&#10;they crossed the road. Here the noise of trams, the lights and the&#10;crowd released them from their silence.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;There she is!&#34; said Corley.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At the corner of Hume Street a young woman was standing. She&#10;wore a blue dress and a white sailor hat. She stood on the&#10;curbstone, swinging a sunshade in one hand. Lenehan grew&#10;lively.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Let&#39;s have a look at her, Corley,&#34; he said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Corley glanced sideways at his friend and an unpleasant grin&#10;appeared on his face.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Are you trying to get inside me?&#34; he asked.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Damn it!&#34; said Lenehan boldly, &#34;I don&#39;t want an introduction.&#10;All I want is to have a look at her. I&#39;m not going to eat her.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O&#38;#160;&#8230; A look at her?&#34; said Corley, more amiably. &#34;Well&#8230; I&#39;ll&#10;tell you what. I&#39;ll go over and talk to her and you can pass&#10;by.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Right!&#34; said Lenehan.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Corley had already thrown one leg over the chains when Lenehan&#10;called out:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And after? Where will we meet?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Half ten,&#34; answered Corley, bringing over his other leg.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Where?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Corner of Merrion Street. We&#39;ll be coming back.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Work it all right now,&#34; said Lenehan in farewell.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Corley did not answer. He sauntered across the road swaying his&#10;head from side to side. His bulk, his easy pace, and the solid&#10;sound of his boots had something of the conqueror in them. He&#10;approached the young woman and, without saluting, began at once to&#10;converse with her. She swung her umbrella more quickly and executed&#10;half turns on her heels. Once or twice when he spoke to her at&#10;close quarters she laughed and bent her head.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Lenehan observed them for a few minutes. Then he walked rapidly&#10;along beside the chains at some distance and crossed the road&#10;obliquely. As he approached Hume Street corner he found the air&#10;heavily scented and his eyes made a swift anxious scrutiny of the&#10;young woman&#39;s appearance. She had her Sunday finery on. Her blue&#10;serge skirt was held at the waist by a belt of black leather. The&#10;great silver buckle of her belt seemed to depress the centre of her&#10;body, catching the light stuff of her white blouse like a clip. She&#10;wore a short black jacket with mother-of-pearl buttons and a ragged&#10;black boa. The ends of her tulle collarette had been carefully&#10;disordered and a big bunch of red flowers was pinned in her bosom&#10;stems upwards. Lenehan&#39;s eyes noted approvingly her stout short&#10;muscular body. rank rude health glowed in her face, on her fat red&#10;cheeks and in her unabashed blue eyes. Her features were blunt. She&#10;had broad nostrils, a straggling mouth which lay open in a&#10;contented leer, and two projecting front teeth. As he passed&#10;Lenehan took off his cap and, after about ten seconds, Corley&#10;returned a salute to the air. This he did by raising his hand&#10;vaguely and pensively changing the angle of position of his&#10;hat.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Lenehan walked as far as the Shelbourne Hotel where he halted&#10;and waited. After waiting for a little time he saw them coming&#10;towards him and, when they turned to the right, he followed them,&#10;stepping lightly in his white shoes, down one side of Merrion&#10;Square. As he walked on slowly, timing his pace to theirs, he&#10;watched Corley&#39;s head which turned at every moment towards the&#10;young woman&#39;s face like a big ball revolving on a pivot. He kept&#10;the pair in view until he had seen them climbing the stairs of the&#10;Donnybrook tram; then he turned about and went back the way he had&#10;come.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now that he was alone his face looked older. His gaiety seemed&#10;to forsake him and, as he came by the railings of the Duke&#39;s Lawn,&#10;he allowed his hand to run along them. The air which the harpist&#10;had played began to control his movements His softly padded feet&#10;played the melody while his fingers swept a scale of variations&#10;idly along the railings after each group of notes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He walked listlessly round Stephen&#39;s Green and then down Grafton&#10;Street. Though his eyes took note of many elements of the crowd&#10;through which he passed they did so morosely. He found trivial all&#10;that was meant to charm him and did not answer the glances which&#10;invited him to be bold. He knew that he would have to speak a great&#10;deal, to invent and to amuse and his brain and throat were too dry&#10;for such a task. The problem of how he could pass the hours till he&#10;met Corley again troubled him a little. He could think of no way of&#10;passing them but to keep on walking. He turned to the left when he&#10;came to the corner of Rutland Square and felt more at ease in the&#10;dark quiet street, the sombre look of which suited his mood. He&#10;paused at last before the window of a poor-looking shop over which&#10;the words Refreshment Bar were printed in white letters. On the&#10;glass of the window were two flying inscriptions: Ginger Beer and&#10;Ginger Ale. A cut ham was exposed on a great blue dish while near&#10;it on a plate lay a segment of very light plum-pudding. He eyed&#10;this food earnestly for some time and then, after glancing warily&#10;up and down the street, went into the shop quickly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He was hungry for, except some biscuits which he had asked two&#10;grudging curates to bring him, he had eaten nothing since&#10;breakfast-time. He sat down at an uncovered wooden table opposite&#10;two work-girls and a mechanic. A slatternly girl waited on him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;How much is a plate of peas?&#34; he asked.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Three halfpence, sir,&#34; said the girl.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Bring me a plate of peas,&#34; he said, &#34;and a bottle of ginger&#10;beer.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He spoke roughly in order to belie his air of gentility for his&#10;entry had been followed by a pause of talk. His face was heated. To&#10;appear natural he pushed his cap back on his head and planted his&#10;elbows on the table. The mechanic and the two work-girls examined&#10;him point by point before resuming their conversation in a subdued&#10;voice. The girl brought him a plate of grocer&#39;s hot peas, seasoned&#10;with pepper and vinegar, a fork and his ginger beer. He ate his&#10;food greedily and found it so good that he made a note of the shop&#10;mentally. When he had eaten all the peas he sipped his ginger beer&#10;and sat for some time thinking of Corley&#39;s adventure. In his&#10;imagination he beheld the pair of lovers walking along some dark&#10;road; he heard Corley&#39;s voice in deep energetic gallantries and saw&#10;again the leer of the young woman&#39;s mouth. This vision made him&#10;feel keenly his own poverty of purse and spirit. He was tired of&#10;knocking about, of pulling the devil by the tail, of shifts and&#10;intrigues. He would be thirty-one in November. Would he never get a&#10;good job? Would he never have a home of his own? He thought how&#10;pleasant it would be to have a warm fire to sit by and a good&#10;dinner to sit down to. He had walked the streets long enough with&#10;friends and with girls. He knew what those friends were worth: he&#10;knew the girls too. Experience had embittered his heart against the&#10;world. But all hope had not left him. He felt better after having&#10;eaten than he had felt before, less weary of his life, less&#10;vanquished in spirit. He might yet be able to settle down in some&#10;snug corner and live happily if he could only come across some good&#10;simple-minded girl with a little of the ready.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He paid twopence halfpenny to the slatternly girl and went out&#10;of the shop to begin his wandering again. He went into Capel Street&#10;and walked along towards the City Hall. Then he turned into Dame&#10;Street. At the corner of George&#39;s Street he met two friends of his&#10;and stopped to converse with them. He was glad that he could rest&#10;from all his walking. His friends asked him had he seen Corley and&#10;what was the latest. He replied that he had spent the day with&#10;Corley. His friends talked very little. They looked vacantly after&#10;some figures in the crowd and sometimes made a critical remark. One&#10;said that he had seen Mac an hour before in Westmoreland Street. At&#10;this Lenehan said that he had been with Mac the night before in&#10;Egan&#39;s. The young man who had seen Mac in Westmoreland Street asked&#10;was it true that Mac had won a bit over a billiard match. Lenehan&#10;did not know: he said that Holohan had stood them drinks in&#10;Egan&#39;s.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He left his friends at a quarter to ten and went up George&#39;s&#10;Street. He turned to the left at the City Markets and walked on&#10;into Grafton Street. The crowd of girls and young men had thinned&#10;and on his way up the street he heard many groups and couples&#10;bidding one another good-night. He went as far as the clock of the&#10;College of Surgeons: it was on the stroke of ten. He set off&#10;briskly along the northern side of the Green hurrying for fear&#10;Corley should return too soon. When he reached the corner of&#10;Merrion Street he took his stand in the shadow of a lamp and&#10;brought out one of the cigarettes which he had reserved and lit it.&#10;He leaned against the lamp-post and kept his gaze fixed on the part&#10;from which he expected to see Corley and the young woman&#10;return.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;His mind became active again. He wondered had Corley managed it&#10;successfully. He wondered if he had asked her yet or if he would&#10;leave it to the last. He suffered all the pangs and thrills of his&#10;friend&#39;s situation as well as those of his own. But the memory of&#10;Corley&#39;s slowly revolving head calmed him somewhat: he was sure&#10;Corley would pull it off all right. All at once the idea struck him&#10;that perhaps Corley had seen her home by another way and given him&#10;the slip. His eyes searched the street: there was no sign of them.&#10;Yet it was surely half-an-hour since he had seen the clock of the&#10;College of Surgeons. Would Corley do a thing like that? He lit his&#10;last cigarette and began to smoke it nervously. He strained his&#10;eyes as each tram stopped at the far corner of the square. They&#10;must have gone home by another way. The paper of his cigarette&#10;broke and he flung it into the road with a curse.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Suddenly he saw them coming towards him. He started with delight&#10;and keeping close to his lamp-post tried to read the result in&#10;their walk. They were walking quickly, the young woman taking quick&#10;short steps, while Corley kept beside her with his long stride.&#10;They did not seem to be speaking. An intimation of the result&#10;pricked him like the point of a sharp instrument. He knew Corley&#10;would fail; he knew it was no go.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;They turned down Baggot Street and he followed them at once,&#10;taking the other footpath. When they stopped he stopped too. They&#10;talked for a few moments and then the young woman went down the&#10;steps into the area of a house. Corley remained standing at the&#10;edge of the path, a little distance from the front steps. Some&#10;minutes passed. Then the hall-door was opened slowly and&#10;cautiously. A woman came running down the front steps and coughed.&#10;Corley turned and went towards her. His broad figure hid hers from&#10;view for a few seconds and then she reappeared running up the&#10;steps. The door closed on her and Corley began to walk swiftly&#10;towards Stephen&#39;s Green.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Lenehan hurried on in the same direction. Some drops of light&#10;rain fell. He took them as a warning and, glancing back towards the&#10;house which the young woman had entered to see that he was not&#10;observed, he ran eagerly across the road. Anxiety and his swift run&#10;made him pant. He called out:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Hallo, Corley!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Corley turned his head to see who had called him, and then&#10;continued walking as before. Lenehan ran after him, settling the&#10;waterproof on his shoulders with one hand.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Hallo, Corley!&#34; he cried again.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He came level with his friend and looked keenly in his face. He&#10;could see nothing there.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well?&#34; he said. &#34;Did it come off?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;They had reached the corner of Ely Place. Still without&#10;answering, Corley swerved to the left and went up the side street.&#10;His features were composed in stern calm. Lenehan kept up with his&#10;friend, breathing uneasily. He was baffled and a note of menace&#10;pierced through his voice.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Can&#39;t you tell us?&#34; he said. &#34;Did you try her?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Corley halted at the first lamp and stared grimly before him.&#10;Then with a grave gesture he extended a hand towards the light and,&#10;smiling, opened it slowly to the gaze of his disciple. A small gold&#10;coin shone in the palm.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 8, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/5', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Boarding House'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mrs. Mooney was a butcher&#39;s daughter. She was a woman who was&#10;quite able to keep things to herself: a determined woman. She had&#10;married her father&#39;s foreman and opened a butcher&#39;s shop near&#10;Spring Gardens. But as soon as his father-in-law was dead Mr.&#10;Mooney began to go to the devil. He drank, plundered the till, ran&#10;headlong into debt. It was no use making him take the pledge: he&#10;was sure to break out again a few days after. By fighting his wife&#10;in the presence of customers and by buying bad meat he ruined his&#10;business. One night he went for his wife with the cleaver and she&#10;had to sleep a neighbour&#39;s house.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;After that they lived apart. She went to the priest and got a&#10;separation from him with care of the children. She would give him&#10;neither money nor food nor house-room; and so he was obliged to&#10;enlist himself as a sheriff&#39;s man. He was a shabby stooped little&#10;drunkard with a white face and a white moustache white eyebrows,&#10;pencilled above his little eyes, which were veined and raw; and all&#10;day long he sat in the bailiff&#39;s room, waiting to be put on a job.&#10;Mrs. Mooney, who had taken what remained of her money out of the&#10;butcher business and set up a boarding house in Hardwicke Street,&#10;was a big imposing woman. Her house had a floating population made&#10;up of tourists from Liverpool and the Isle of Man and,&#10;occasionally, artistes from the music halls. Its resident&#10;population was made up of clerks from the city. She governed the&#10;house cunningly and firmly, knew when to give credit, when to be&#10;stern and when to let things pass. All the resident young men spoke&#10;of her as The Madam.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mrs. Mooney&#39;s young men paid fifteen shillings a week for board&#10;and lodgings (beer or stout at dinner excluded). They shared in&#10;common tastes and occupations and for this reason they were very&#10;chummy with one another. They discussed with one another the&#10;chances of favourites and outsiders. Jack Mooney, the Madam&#39;s son,&#10;who was clerk to a commission agent in Fleet Street, had the&#10;reputation of being a hard case. He was fond of using soldiers&#39;&#10;obscenities: usually he came home in the small hours. When he met&#10;his friends he had always a good one to tell them and he was always&#10;sure to be on to a good thing-that is to say, a likely horse or a&#10;likely artiste. He was also handy with the mits and sang comic&#10;songs. On Sunday nights there would often be a reunion in Mrs.&#10;Mooney&#39;s front drawing-room. The music-hall artistes would oblige;&#10;and Sheridan played waltzes and polkas and vamped accompaniments.&#10;Polly Mooney, the Madam&#39;s daughter, would also sing. She sang:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I&#39;m a&#38;#160;&#8230; naughty girl. You needn&#39;t sham: You know I am.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Polly was a slim girl of nineteen; she had light soft hair and a&#10;small full mouth. Her eyes, which were grey with a shade of green&#10;through them, had a habit of glancing upwards when she spoke with&#10;anyone, which made her look like a little perverse madonna. Mrs.&#10;Mooney had first sent her daughter to be a typist in a&#10;corn-factor&#39;s office but, as a disreputable sheriff&#39;s man used to&#10;come every other day to the office, asking to be allowed to say a&#10;word to his daughter, she had taken her daughter home again and set&#10;her to do housework. As Polly was very lively the intention was to&#10;give her the run of the young men. Besides young men like to feel&#10;that there is a young woman not very far away. Polly, of course,&#10;flirted with the young men but Mrs. Mooney, who was a shrewd judge,&#10;knew that the young men were only passing the time away: none of&#10;them meant business. Things went on so for a long time and Mrs.&#10;Mooney began to think of sending Polly back to typewriting when she&#10;noticed that something was going on between Polly and one of the&#10;young men. She watched the pair and kept her own counsel.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Polly knew that she was being watched, but still her mother&#39;s&#10;persistent silence could not be misunderstood. There had been no&#10;open complicity between mother and daughter, no open understanding&#10;but, though people in the house began to talk of the affair, still&#10;Mrs. Mooney did not intervene. Polly began to grow a little strange&#10;in her manner and the young man was evidently perturbed. At last,&#10;when she judged it to be the right moment, Mrs. Mooney intervened.&#10;She dealt with moral problems as a cleaver deals with meat: and in&#10;this case she had made up her mind.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was a bright Sunday morning of early summer, promising heat,&#10;but with a fresh breeze blowing. All the windows of the boarding&#10;house were open and the lace curtains ballooned gently towards the&#10;street beneath the raised sashes. The belfry of George&#39;s Church&#10;sent out constant peals and worshippers, singly or in groups,&#10;traversed the little circus before the church, revealing their&#10;purpose by their self-contained demeanour no less than by the&#10;little volumes in their gloved hands. Breakfast was over in the&#10;boarding house and the table of the breakfast-room was covered with&#10;plates on which lay yellow streaks of eggs with morsels of&#10;bacon-fat and bacon-rind. Mrs. Mooney sat in the straw arm-chair&#10;and watched the servant Mary remove the breakfast things. She mad&#10;Mary collect the crusts and pieces of broken bread to help to make&#10;Tuesday&#39;s bread- pudding. When the table was cleared, the broken&#10;bread collected, the sugar and butter safe under lock and key, she&#10;began to reconstruct the interview which she had had the night&#10;before with Polly. Things were as she had suspected: she had been&#10;frank in her questions and Polly had been frank in her answers.&#10;Both had been somewhat awkward, of course. She had been made&#10;awkward by her not wishing to receive the news in too cavalier a&#10;fashion or to seem to have connived and Polly had been made awkward&#10;not merely because allusions of that kind always made her awkward&#10;but also because she did not wish it to be thought that in her wise&#10;innocence she had divined the intention behind her mother&#39;s&#10;tolerance.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mrs. Mooney glanced instinctively at the little gilt clock on&#10;the mantelpiece as soon as she had become aware through her revery&#10;that the bells of George&#39;s Church had stopped ringing. It was&#10;seventeen minutes past eleven: she would have lots of time to have&#10;the matter out with Mr. Doran and then catch short twelve at&#10;Marlborough Street. She was sure she would win. To begin with she&#10;had all the weight of social opinion on her side: she was an&#10;outraged mother. She had allowed him to live beneath her roof,&#10;assuming that he was a man of honour and he had simply abused her&#10;hospitality. He was thirty-four or thirty-five years of age, so&#10;that youth could not be pleaded as his excuse; nor could ignorance&#10;be his excuse since he was a man who had seen something of the&#10;world. He had simply taken advantage of Polly&#39;s youth and&#10;inexperience: that was evident. The question was: What reparation&#10;would he make?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There must be reparation made in such case. It is all very well&#10;for the man: he can go his ways as if nothing had happened, having&#10;had his moment of pleasure, but the girl has to bear the brunt.&#10;Some mothers would be content to patch up such an affair for a sum&#10;of money; she had known cases of it. But she would not do so. For&#10;her only one reparation could make up for the loss of her&#10;daughter&#39;s honour: marriage.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She counted all her cards again before sending Mary up to&#10;Doran&#39;s room to say that she wished to speak with him. She felt&#10;sure she would win. He was a serious young man, not rakish or&#10;loud-voiced like the others. If it had been Mr. Sheridan or Mr.&#10;Meade or Bantam Lyons her task would have been much harder. She did&#10;not think he would face publicity. All the lodgers in the house&#10;knew something of the affair; details had been invented by some.&#10;Besides, he had been employed for thirteen years in a great&#10;Catholic wine-merchant&#39;s office and publicity would mean for him,&#10;perhaps, the loss of his job. Whereas if he agreed all might be&#10;well. She knew he had a good screw for one thing and she suspected&#10;he had a bit of stuff put by.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Nearly the half-hour! She stood up and surveyed herself in the&#10;pier-glass. The decisive expression of her great florid face&#10;satisfied her and she thought of some mothers she knew who could&#10;not get their daughters off their hands.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Doran was very anxious indeed this Sunday morning. He had&#10;made two attempts to shave but his hand had been so unsteady that&#10;he had been obliged to desist. Three days&#39; reddish beard fringed&#10;his jaws and every two or three minutes a mist gathered on his&#10;glasses so that he had to take them off and polish them with his&#10;pocket-handkerchief. The recollection of his confession of the&#10;night before was a cause of acute pain to him; the priest had drawn&#10;out every ridiculous detail of the affair and in the end had so&#10;magnified his sin that he was almost thankful at being afforded a&#10;loophole of reparation. The harm was done. What could he do now but&#10;marry her or run away? He could not brazen it out. The affair would&#10;be sure to be talked of and his employer would be certain to hear&#10;of it. Dublin is such a small city: everyone knows everyone else&#39;s&#10;business. He felt his heart leap warmly in his throat as he heard&#10;in his excited imagination old Mr. Leonard calling out in his&#10;rasping voice: &#34;Send Mr. Doran here, please.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;All his long years of service gone for nothing! All his industry&#10;and diligence thrown away! As a young man he had sown his wild&#10;oats, of course; he had boasted of his free-thinking and denied the&#10;existence of God to his companions in public- houses. But that was&#10;all passed and done with&#8230; nearly. He still bought a copy of&#10;Reynolds&#39;s Newspaper every week but he attended to his religious&#10;duties and for nine-tenths of the year lived a regular life. He had&#10;money enough to settle down on; it was not that. But the family&#10;would look down on her. First of all there was her disreputable&#10;father and then her mother&#39;s boarding house was beginning to get a&#10;certain fame. He had a notion that he was being had. He could&#10;imagine his friends talking of the affair and laughing. She was a&#10;little vulgar; some times she said &#34;I seen&#34; and &#34;If I had&#39;ve&#10;known.&#34; But what would grammar matter if he really loved her? He&#10;could not make up his mind whether to like her or despise her for&#10;what she had done. Of course he had done it too. His instinct urged&#10;him to remain free, not to marry. Once you are married you are done&#10;for, it said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;While he was sitting helplessly on the side of the bed in shirt&#10;and trousers she tapped lightly at his door and entered. She told&#10;him all, that she had made a clean breast of it to her mother and&#10;that her mother would speak with him that morning. She cried and&#10;threw her arms round his neck, saying:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O Bob! Bob! What am I to do? What am I to do at all?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She would put an end to herself, she said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He comforted her feebly, telling her not to cry, that it would&#10;be all right, never fear. He felt against his shirt the agitation&#10;of her bosom.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was not altogether his fault that it had happened. He&#10;remembered well, with the curious patient memory of the celibate,&#10;the first casual caresses her dress, her breath, her fingers had&#10;given him. Then late one night as he was undressing for she had&#10;tapped at his door, timidly. She wanted to relight her candle at&#10;his for hers had been blown out by a gust. It was her bath night.&#10;She wore a loose open combing- jacket of printed flannel. Her white&#10;instep shone in the opening of her furry slippers and the blood&#10;glowed warmly behind her perfumed skin. From her hands and wrists&#10;too as she lit and steadied her candle a faint perfume arose.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;On nights when he came in very late it was she who warmed up his&#10;dinner. He scarcely knew what he was eating feeling her beside him&#10;alone, at night, in the sleeping house. And her thoughtfulness! If&#10;the night was anyway cold or wet or windy there was sure to be a&#10;little tumbler of punch ready for him. Perhaps they could be happy&#10;together&#8230; .&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;They used to go upstairs together on tiptoe, each with a candle,&#10;and on the third landing exchange reluctant goodnights. They used&#10;to kiss. He remembered well her eyes, the touch of her hand and his&#10;delirium&#8230; .&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But delirium passes. He echoed her phrase, applying it to&#10;himself: &#34;What am I to do?&#34; The instinct of the celibate warned him&#10;to hold back. But the sin was there; even his sense of honour told&#10;him that reparation must be made for such a sin.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;While he was sitting with her on the side of the bed Mary came&#10;to the door and said that the missus wanted to see him in the&#10;parlour. He stood up to put on his coat and waistcoat, more&#10;helpless than ever. When he was dressed he went over to her to&#10;comfort her. It would be all right, never fear. He left her crying&#10;on the bed and moaning softly: &#34;O my God!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Going down the stairs his glasses became so dimmed with moisture&#10;that he had to take them off and polish them. He longed to ascend&#10;through the roof and fly away to another country where he would&#10;never hear again of his trouble, and yet a force pushed him&#10;downstairs step by step. The implacable faces of his employer and&#10;of the Madam stared upon his discomfiture. On the last flight of&#10;stairs he passed Jack Mooney who was coming up from the pantry&#10;nursing two bottles of Bass. They saluted coldly; and the lover&#39;s&#10;eyes rested for a second or two on a thick bulldog face and a pair&#10;of thick short arms. When he reached the foot of the staircase he&#10;glanced up and saw Jack regarding him from the door of the&#10;return-room.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Suddenly he remembered the night when one of the musichall&#10;artistes, a little blond Londoner, had made a rather free allusion&#10;to Polly. The reunion had been almost broken up on account of&#10;Jack&#39;s violence. Everyone tried to quiet him. The music-hall&#10;artiste, a little paler than usual, kept smiling and saying that&#10;there was no harm meant: but Jack kept shouting at him that if any&#10;fellow tried that sort of a game on with his sister he&#39;d bloody&#10;well put his teeth down his throat, so he would.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Polly sat for a little time on the side of the bed, crying. Then&#10;she dried her eyes and went over to the looking-glass. She dipped&#10;the end of the towel in the water-jug and refreshed her eyes with&#10;the cool water. She looked at herself in profile and readjusted a&#10;hairpin above her ear. Then she went back to the bed again and sat&#10;at the foot. She regarded the pillows for a long time and the sight&#10;of them awakened in her mind secret, amiable memories. She rested&#10;the nape of her neck against the cool iron bed-rail and fell into a&#10;reverie. There was no longer any perturbation visible on her&#10;face.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She waited on patiently, almost cheerfully, without alarm. her&#10;memories gradually giving place to hopes and visions of the future.&#10;Her hopes and visions were so intricate that she no longer saw the&#10;white pillows on which her gaze was fixed or remembered that she&#10;was waiting for anything.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At last she heard her mother calling. She started to her feet&#10;and ran to the banisters.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Polly! Polly!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, mamma?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Come down, dear. Mr. Doran wants to speak to you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then she remembered what she had been waiting for.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 8, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/5', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode(' A&#10;Little Cloud'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;Eight years before he had seen his friend off at the North Wall&#10;and wished him godspeed. Gallaher had got on. You could tell that&#10;at once by his travelled air, his well-cut tweed suit, and fearless&#10;accent. Few fellows had talents like his and fewer still could&#10;remain unspoiled by such success. Gallaher&#39;s heart was in the right&#10;place and he had deserved to win. It was something to have a friend&#10;like that.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Little Chandler&#39;s thoughts ever since lunch-time had been of his&#10;meeting with Gallaher, of Gallaher&#39;s invitation and of the great&#10;city London where Gallaher lived. He was called Little Chandler&#10;because, though he was but slightly under the average stature, he&#10;gave one the idea of being a little man. His hands were white and&#10;small, his frame was fragile, his voice was quiet and his manners&#10;were refined. He took the greatest care of his fair silken hair and&#10;moustache and used perfume discreetly on his handkerchief. The&#10;half-moons of his nails were perfect and when he smiled you caught&#10;a glimpse of a row of childish white teeth.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As he sat at his desk in the King&#39;s Inns he thought what changes&#10;those eight years had brought. The friend whom he had known under a&#10;shabby and necessitous guise had become a brilliant figure on the&#10;London Press. He turned often from his tiresome writing to gaze out&#10;of the office window. The glow of a late autumn sunset covered the&#10;grass plots and walks. It cast a shower of kindly golden dust on&#10;the untidy nurses and decrepit old men who drowsed on the benches;&#10;it flickered upon all the moving figures&#8212; on the children who ran&#10;screaming along the gravel paths and on everyone who passed through&#10;the gardens. He watched the scene and thought of life; and (as&#10;always happened when he thought of life) he became sad. A gentle&#10;melancholy took possession of him. He felt how useless it was to&#10;struggle against fortune, this being the burden of wisdom which the&#10;ages had bequeathed to him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He remembered the books of poetry upon his shelves at home. He&#10;had bought them in his bachelor days and many an evening, as he sat&#10;in the little room off the hall, he had been tempted to take one&#10;down from the bookshelf and read out something to his wife. But&#10;shyness had always held him back; and so the books had remained on&#10;their shelves. At times he repeated lines to himself and this&#10;consoled him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When his hour had struck he stood up and took leave of his desk&#10;and of his fellow-clerks punctiliously. He emerged from under the&#10;feudal arch of the King&#39;s Inns, a neat modest figure, and walked&#10;swiftly down Henrietta Street. The golden sunset was waning and the&#10;air had grown sharp. A horde of grimy children populated the&#10;street. They stood or ran in the roadway or crawled up the steps&#10;before the gaping doors or squatted like mice upon the thresholds.&#10;Little Chandler gave them no thought. He picked his way deftly&#10;through all that minute vermin-like life and under the shadow of&#10;the gaunt spectral mansions in which the old nobility of Dublin had&#10;roystered. No memory of the past touched him, for his mind was full&#10;of a present joy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He had never been in Corless&#39;s but he knew the value of the&#10;name. He knew that people went there after the theatre to eat&#10;oysters and drink liqueurs; and he had heard that the waiters there&#10;spoke French and German. Walking swiftly by at night he had seen&#10;cabs drawn up before the door and richly dressed ladies, escorted&#10;by cavaliers, alight and enter quickly. They wore noisy dresses and&#10;many wraps. Their faces were powdered and they caught up their&#10;dresses, when they touched earth, like alarmed Atalantas. He had&#10;always passed without turning his head to look. It was his habit to&#10;walk swiftly in the street even by day and whenever he found&#10;himself in the city late at night he hurried on his way&#10;apprehensively and excitedly. Sometimes, however, he courted the&#10;causes of his fear. He chose the darkest and narrowest streets and,&#10;as he walked boldly forward, the silence that was spread about his&#10;footsteps troubled him, the wandering, silent figures troubled him;&#10;and at times a sound of low fugitive laughter made him tremble like&#10;a leaf.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He turned to the right towards Capel Street. Ignatius Gallaher&#10;on the London Press! Who would have thought it possible eight years&#10;before? Still, now that he reviewed the past, Little Chandler could&#10;remember many signs of future greatness in his friend. People used&#10;to say that Ignatius Gallaher was wild Of course, he did mix with a&#10;rakish set of fellows at that time. drank freely and borrowed money&#10;on all sides. In the end he had got mixed up in some shady affair,&#10;some money transaction: at least, that was one version of his&#10;flight. But nobody denied him talent. There was always a certain&#8230;&#10;something in Ignatius Gallaher that impressed you in spite of&#10;yourself. Even when he was out at elbows and at his wits&#39; end for&#10;money he kept up a bold face. Little Chandler remembered (and the&#10;remembrance brought a slight flush of pride to his cheek) one of&#10;Ignatius Gallaher&#39;s sayings when he was in a tight corner:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Half time now, boys,&#34; he used to say light-heartedly. &#34;Where&#39;s&#10;my considering cap?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;That was Ignatius Gallaher all out; and, damn it, you couldn&#39;t&#10;but admire him for it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Little Chandler quickened his pace. For the first time in his&#10;life he felt himself superior to the people he passed. For the&#10;first time his soul revolted against the dull inelegance of Capel&#10;Street. There was no doubt about it: if you wanted to succeed you&#10;had to go away. You could do nothing in Dublin. As he crossed&#10;Grattan Bridge he looked down the river towards the lower quays and&#10;pitied the poor stunted houses. They seemed to him a band of&#10;tramps, huddled together along the riverbanks, their old coats&#10;covered with dust and soot, stupefied by the panorama of sunset and&#10;waiting for the first chill of night bid them arise, shake&#10;themselves and begone. He wondered whether he could write a poem to&#10;express his idea. Perhaps Gallaher might be able to get it into&#10;some London paper for him. Could he write something original? He&#10;was not sure what idea he wished to express but the thought that a&#10;poetic moment had touched him took life within him like an infant&#10;hope. He stepped onward bravely.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Every step brought him nearer to London, farther from his own&#10;sober inartistic life. A light began to tremble on the horizon of&#10;his mind. He was not so old&#8212;thirty-two. His temperament might be&#10;said to be just at the point of maturity. There were so many&#10;different moods and impressions that he wished to express in verse.&#10;He felt them within him. He tried weigh his soul to see if it was a&#10;poet&#39;s soul. Melancholy was the dominant note of his temperament,&#10;he thought, but it was a melancholy tempered by recurrences of&#10;faith and resignation and simple joy. If he could give expression&#10;to it in a book of poems perhaps men would listen. He would never&#10;be popular: he saw that. He could not sway the crowd but he might&#10;appeal to a little circle of kindred minds. The English critics,&#10;perhaps, would recognise him as one of the Celtic school by reason&#10;of the melancholy tone of his poems; besides that, he would put in&#10;allusions. He began to invent sentences and phrases from the notice&#10;which his book would get. &#34;Mr. Chandler has the gift of easy and&#10;graceful verse.&#34;&#38;#160;&#8230; &#34;wistful sadness pervades these&#10;poems.&#34;&#38;#160;&#8230; &#34;The Celtic note.&#34; It was a pity his name was not&#10;more Irish-looking. Perhaps it would be better to insert his&#10;mother&#39;s name before the surname: Thomas Malone Chandler, or better&#10;still: T. Malone Chandler. He would speak to Gallaher about it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He pursued his revery so ardently that he passed his street and&#10;had to turn back. As he came near Corless&#39;s his former agitation&#10;began to overmaster him and he halted before the door in&#10;indecision. Finally he opened the door and entered.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The light and noise of the bar held him at the doorways for a&#10;few moments. He looked about him, but his sight was confused by the&#10;shining of many red and green wine-glasses The bar seemed to him to&#10;be full of people and he felt that the people were observing him&#10;curiously. He glanced quickly to right and left (frowning slightly&#10;to make his errand appear serious), but when his sight cleared a&#10;little he saw that nobody had turned to look at him: and there,&#10;sure enough, was Ignatius Gallaher leaning with his back against&#10;the counter and his feet planted far apart.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Hallo, Tommy, old hero, here you are! What is it to be? What&#10;will you have? I&#39;m taking whisky: better stuff than we get across&#10;the water. Soda? Lithia? No mineral? I&#39;m the same Spoils the&#10;flavour&#8230; . Here, garcon, bring us two halves of malt whisky, like a&#10;good fellow&#8230; . Well, and how have you been pulling along since I&#10;saw you last? Dear God, how old we&#39;re getting! Do you see any signs&#10;of aging in me&#8212;eh, what? A little grey and thin on the top&#8212;&#10;what?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Ignatius Gallaher took off his hat and displayed a large closely&#10;cropped head. His face was heavy, pale and cleanshaven. His eyes,&#10;which were of bluish slate-colour, relieved his unhealthy pallor&#10;and shone out plainly above the vivid orange tie he wore. Between&#10;these rival features the lips appeared very long and shapeless and&#10;colourless. He bent his head and felt with two sympathetic fingers&#10;the thin hair at the crown. Little Chandler shook his head as a&#10;denial. Ignatius Galaher put on his hat again.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It pulls you down,&#34; be said, &#34;Press life. Always hurry and&#10;scurry, looking for copy and sometimes not finding it: and then,&#10;always to have something new in your stuff. Damn proofs and&#10;printers, I say, for a few days. I&#39;m deuced glad, I can tell you,&#10;to get back to the old country. Does a fellow good, a bit of a&#10;holiday. I feel a ton better since I landed again in dear dirty&#10;Dublin&#8230; . Here you are, Tommy. Water? Say when.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Little Chandler allowed his whisky to be very much diluted.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You don&#39;t know what&#39;s good for you, my boy,&#34; said Ignatius&#10;Gallaher. &#34;I drink mine neat.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I drink very little as a rule,&#34; said Little Chandler modestly.&#10;&#34;An odd half-one or so when I meet any of the old crowd: that&#39;s&#10;all.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ah well,&#34; said Ignatius Gallaher, cheerfully, &#34;here&#39;s to us and&#10;to old times and old acquaintance.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;They clinked glasses and drank the toast.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I met some of the old gang today,&#34; said Ignatius Gallaher.&#10;&#34;O&#39;Hara seems to be in a bad way. What&#39;s he doing?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Nothing, said Little Chandler. &#34;He&#39;s gone to the dogs.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But Hogan has a good sit, hasn&#39;t he?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes; he&#39;s in the Land Commission.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I met him one night in London and he seemed to be very flush&#8230; .&#10;Poor O&#39;Hara! Boose, I suppose?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Other things, too,&#34; said Little Chandler shortly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Ignatius Gallaher laughed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Tommy,&#34; he said, &#34;I see you haven&#39;t changed an atom. You&#39;re the&#10;very same serious person that used to lecture me on Sunday mornings&#10;when I had a sore head and a fur on my tongue. You&#39;d want to knock&#10;about a bit in the world. Have you never been anywhere even for a&#10;trip?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I&#39;ve been to the Isle of Man,&#34; said Little Chandler.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Ignatius Gallaher laughed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The Isle of Man!&#34; he said. &#34;Go to London or Paris: Paris, for&#10;choice. That&#39;d do you good.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Have you seen Paris?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I should think I have! I&#39;ve knocked about there a little.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And is it really so beautiful as they say?&#34; asked Little&#10;Chandler.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He sipped a little of his drink while Ignatius Gallaher finished&#10;his boldly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Beautiful?&#34; said Ignatius Gallaher, pausing on the word and on&#10;the flavour of his drink. &#34;It&#39;s not so beautiful, you know. Of&#10;course, it is beautiful&#8230; . But it&#39;s the life of Paris; that&#39;s the&#10;thing. Ah, there&#39;s no city like Paris for gaiety, movement,&#10;excitement&#8230; .&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Little Chandler finished his whisky and, after some trouble,&#10;succeeded in catching the barman&#39;s eye. He ordered the same&#10;again.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I&#39;ve been to the Moulin Rouge,&#34; Ignatius Gallaher continued&#10;when the barman had removed their glasses, &#34;and I&#39;ve been to all&#10;the Bohemian cafes. Hot stuff! Not for a pious chap like you,&#10;Tommy.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Little Chandler said nothing until the barman returned with two&#10;glasses: then he touched his friend&#39;s glass lightly and&#10;reciprocated the former toast. He was beginning to feel somewhat&#10;disillusioned. Gallaher&#39;s accent and way of expressing himself did&#10;not please him. There was something vulgar in his friend which he&#10;had not observed before. But perhaps it was only the result of&#10;living in London amid the bustle and competition of the Press. The&#10;old personal charm was still there under this new gaudy manner.&#10;And, after all, Gallaher had lived, he had seen the world. Little&#10;Chandler looked at his friend enviously.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Everything in Paris is gay,&#34; said Ignatius Gallaher. &#34;They&#10;believe in enjoying life&#8212;and don&#39;t you think they&#39;re right? If you&#10;want to enjoy yourself properly you must go to Paris. And, mind&#10;you, they&#39;ve a great feeling for the Irish there. When they heard I&#10;was from Ireland they were ready to eat me, man.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Little Chandler took four or five sips from his glass.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Tell me,&#34; he said, &#34;is it true that Paris is so&#8230; immoral as&#10;they say?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Ignatius Gallaher made a catholic gesture with his right&#10;arm.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Every place is immoral,&#34; he said. &#34;Of course you do find spicy&#10;bits in Paris. Go to one of the students&#39; balls, for instance.&#10;That&#39;s lively, if you like, when the cocottes begin to let&#10;themselves loose. You know what they are, I suppose?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I&#39;ve heard of them,&#34; said Little Chandler.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Ignatius Gallaher drank off his whisky and shook his had.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ah,&#34; he said, &#34;you may say what you like. There&#39;s no woman like&#10;the Parisienne&#8212;for style, for go.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Then it is an immoral city,&#34; said Little Chandler, with timid&#10;insistence&#8212;&#34;I mean, compared with London or Dublin?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;London!&#34; said Ignatius Gallaher. &#34;It&#39;s six of one and&#10;half-a-dozen of the other. You ask Hogan, my boy. I showed him a&#10;bit about London when he was over there. He&#39;d open your eye&#8230; . I&#10;say, Tommy, don&#39;t make punch of that whisky: liquor up.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No, really&#8230; .&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O, come on, another one won&#39;t do you any harm. What is it? The&#10;same again, I suppose?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well&#8230; all right.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Francois, the same again&#8230; . Will you smoke, Tommy?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Ignatius Gallaher produced his cigar-case. The two friends lit&#10;their cigars and puffed at them in silence until their drinks were&#10;served.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I&#39;ll tell you my opinion,&#34; said Ignatius Gallaher, emerging&#10;after some time from the clouds of smoke in which he had taken&#10;refuge, &#34;it&#39;s a rum world. Talk of immorality! I&#39;ve heard of&#10;cases&#8212;what am I saying?&#8212;I&#39;ve known them: cases of&#8230; immorality&#8230;&#10;.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Ignatius Gallaher puffed thoughtfully at his cigar and then, in&#10;a calm historian&#39;s tone, he proceeded to sketch for his friend some&#10;pictures of the corruption which was rife abroad. He summarised the&#10;vices of many capitals and seemed inclined to award the palm to&#10;Berlin. Some things he could not vouch for (his friends had told&#10;him), but of others he had had personal experience. He spared&#10;neither rank nor caste. He revealed many of the secrets of&#10;religious houses on the Continent and described some of the&#10;practices which were fashionable in high society and ended by&#10;telling, with details, a story about an English duchess&#8212;a story&#10;which he knew to be true. Little Chandler as astonished.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ah, well,&#34; said Ignatius Gallaher, &#34;here we are in old jog-&#10;along Dublin where nothing is known of such things.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;How dull you must find it,&#34; said Little Chandler, &#34;after all&#10;the other places you&#39;ve seen!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Well,&#34; said Ignatius Gallaher, &#34;it&#39;s a relaxation to come over&#10;here, you know. And, after all, it&#39;s the old country, as they say,&#10;isn&#39;t it? You can&#39;t help having a certain feeling for it. That&#39;s&#10;human nature&#8230; . But tell me something about yourself. Hogan told me&#10;you had&#8230; tasted the joys of connubial bliss. Two years ago, wasn&#39;t&#10;it?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Little Chandler blushed and smiled.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes,&#34; he said. &#34;I was married last May twelve months.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I hope it&#39;s not too late in the day to offer my best wishes,&#34;&#10;said Ignatius Gallaher. &#34;I didn&#39;t know your address or I&#39;d have&#10;done so at the time.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He extended his hand, which Little Chandler took.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well, Tommy,&#34; he said, &#34;I wish you and yours every joy in life,&#10;old chap, and tons of money, and may you never die till I shoot&#10;you. And that&#39;s the wish of a sincere friend, an old friend. You&#10;know that?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I know that,&#34; said Little Chandler.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Any youngsters?&#34; said Ignatius Gallaher.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Little Chandler blushed again.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;We have one child,&#34; he said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Son or daughter?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;A little boy.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Ignatius Gallaher slapped his friend sonorously on the back.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Bravo,&#34; he said, &#34;I wouldn&#39;t doubt you, Tommy.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Little Chandler smiled, looked confusedly at his glass and bit&#10;his lower lip with three childishly white front teeth.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I hope you&#39;ll spend an evening with us,&#34; he said, &#34;before you&#10;go back. My wife will be delighted to meet you. We can have a&#10;little music and&#8212;&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Thanks awfully, old chap,&#34; said Ignatius Gallaher, &#34;I&#39;m sorry&#10;we didn&#39;t meet earlier. But I must leave tomorrow night.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Tonight, perhaps&#8230; ?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I&#39;m awfully sorry, old man. You see I&#39;m over here with another&#10;fellow, clever young chap he is too, and we arranged to go to a&#10;little card-party. Only for that&#8230; &#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O, in that case&#8230; &#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But who knows?&#34; said Ignatius Gallaher considerately. &#34;Next&#10;year I may take a little skip over here now that I&#39;ve broken the&#10;ice. It&#39;s only a pleasure deferred.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Very well,&#34; said Little Chandler, &#34;the next time you come we&#10;must have an evening together. That&#39;s agreed now, isn&#39;t it?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, that&#39;s agreed,&#34; said Ignatius Gallaher. &#34;Next year if I&#10;come, parole d&#39;honneur.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And to clinch the bargain,&#34; said Little Chandler, &#34;we&#39;ll just&#10;have one more now.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Ignatius Gallaher took out a large gold watch and looked a&#10;it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Is it to be the last?&#34; he said. &#34;Because you know, I have an&#10;a.p.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O, yes, positively,&#34; said Little Chandler.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Very well, then,&#34; said Ignatius Gallaher, &#34;let us have another&#10;one as a deoc an doruis&#8212;that&#39;s good vernacular for a small whisky,&#10;I believe.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Little Chandler ordered the drinks. The blush which had risen to&#10;his face a few moments before was establishing itself. A trifle&#10;made him blush at any time: and now he felt warm and excited. Three&#10;small whiskies had gone to his head and Gallaher&#39;s strong cigar had&#10;confused his mind, for he was a delicate and abstinent person. The&#10;adventure of meeting Gallaher after eight years, of finding himself&#10;with Gallaher in Corless&#39;s surrounded by lights and noise, of&#10;listening to Gallaher&#39;s stories and of sharing for a brief space&#10;Gallaher&#39;s vagrant and triumphant life, upset the equipoise of his&#10;sensitive nature. He felt acutely the contrast between his own life&#10;and his friend&#39;s and it seemed to him unjust. Gallaher was his&#10;inferior in birth and education. He was sure that he could do&#10;something better than his friend had ever done, or could ever do,&#10;something higher than mere tawdry journalism if he only got the&#10;chance. What was it that stood in his way? His unfortunate timidity&#10;He wished to vindicate himself in some way, to assert his manhood.&#10;He saw behind Gallaher&#39;s refusal of his invitation. Gallaher was&#10;only patronising him by his friendliness just as he was patronising&#10;Ireland by his visit.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The barman brought their drinks. Little Chandler pushed one&#10;glass towards his friend and took up the other boldly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Who knows?&#34; he said, as they lifted their glasses. &#34;When you&#10;come next year I may have the pleasure of wishing long life and&#10;happiness to Mr. and Mrs. Ignatius Gallaher.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Ignatius Gallaher in the act of drinking closed one eye&#10;expressively over the rim of his glass. When he had drunk he&#10;smacked his lips decisively, set down his glass and said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No blooming fear of that, my boy. I&#39;m going to have my fling&#10;first and see a bit of life and the world before I put my head in&#10;the sack &#8212;if I ever do.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Some day you will,&#34; said Little Chandler calmly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Ignatius Gallaher turned his orange tie and slate-blue eyes full&#10;upon his friend.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You think so?&#34; he said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You&#39;ll put your head in the sack,&#34; repeated Little Chandler&#10;stoutly, &#34;like everyone else if you can find the girl.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He had slightly emphasised his tone and he was aware that he had&#10;betrayed himself; but, though the colour had heightened in his&#10;cheek, he did not flinch from his friend&#39;s gaze. Ignatius Gallaher&#10;watched him for a few moments and then said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;If ever it occurs, you may bet your bottom dollar there&#39;ll be&#10;no mooning and spooning about it. I mean to marry money. She&#39;ll&#10;have a good fat account at the bank or she won&#39;t do for me.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Little Chandler shook his head.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why, man alive,&#34; said Ignatius Gallaher, vehemently, &#34;do you&#10;know what it is? I&#39;ve only to say the word and tomorrow I can have&#10;the woman and the cash. You don&#39;t believe it? Well, I know it.&#10;There are hundreds&#8212;what am I saying?&#8212;thousands of rich Germans and&#10;Jews, rotten with money, that&#39;d only be too glad&#8230; . You wait a&#10;while my boy. See if I don&#39;t play my cards properly. When I go&#10;about a thing I mean business, I tell you. You just wait.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He tossed his glass to his mouth, finished his drink and laughed&#10;loudly. Then he looked thoughtfully before him and said in a calmer&#10;tone:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But I&#39;m in no hurry. They can wait. I don&#39;t fancy tying myself&#10;up to one woman, you know.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He imitated with his mouth the act of tasting and made a wry&#10;face.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Must get a bit stale, I should think,&#34; he said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Little Chandler sat in the room off the hall, holding a child in&#10;his arms. To save money they kept no servant but Annie&#39;s young&#10;sister Monica came for an hour or so in the morning and an hour or&#10;so in the evening to help. But Monica had gone home long ago. It&#10;was a quarter to nine. Little Chandler had come home late for tea&#10;and, moreover, he had forgotten to bring Annie home the parcel of&#10;coffee from Bewley&#39;s. Of course she was in a bad humour and gave&#10;him short answers. She said she would do without any tea but when&#10;it came near the time at which the shop at the corner closed she&#10;decided to go out herself for a quarter of a pound of tea and two&#10;pounds of sugar. She put the sleeping child deftly in his arms and&#10;said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Here. Don&#39;t waken him.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A little lamp with a white china shade stood upon the table and&#10;its light fell over a photograph which was enclosed in a frame of&#10;crumpled horn. It was Annie&#39;s photograph. Little Chandler looked at&#10;it, pausing at the thin tight lips. She wore the pale blue summer&#10;blouse which he had brought her home as a present one Saturday. It&#10;had cost him ten and elevenpence; but what an agony of nervousness&#10;it had cost him! How he had suffered that day, waiting at the shop&#10;door until the shop was empty, standing at the counter and trying&#10;to appear at his ease while the girl piled ladies&#39; blouses before&#10;him, paying at the desk and forgetting to take up the odd penny of&#10;his change, being called back by the cashier, and finally, striving&#10;to hide his blushes as he left the shop by examining the parcel to&#10;see if it was securely tied. When he brought the blouse home Annie&#10;kissed him and said it was very pretty and stylish; but when she&#10;heard the price she threw the blouse on the table and said it was a&#10;regular swindle to charge ten and elevenpence for it. At first she&#10;wanted to take it back but when she tried it on she was delighted&#10;with it, especially with the make of the sleeves, and kissed him&#10;and said he was very good to think of her.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Hm!&#8230;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He looked coldly into the eyes of the photograph and they&#10;answered coldly. Certainly they were pretty and the face itself was&#10;pretty. But he found something mean in it. Why was it so&#10;unconscious and ladylike? The composure of the eyes irritated him.&#10;They repelled him and defied him: there was no passion in them, no&#10;rapture. He thought of what Gallaher had said about rich Jewesses.&#10;Those dark Oriental eyes, he thought, how full they are of passion,&#10;of voluptuous longing!&#8230; Why had he married the eyes in the&#10;photograph?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He caught himself up at the question and glanced nervously round&#10;the room. He found something mean in the pretty furniture which he&#10;had bought for his house on the hire system. Annie had chosen it&#10;herself and it reminded hi of her. It too was prim and pretty. A&#10;dull resentment against his life awoke within him. Could he not&#10;escape from his little house? Was it too late for him to try to&#10;live bravely like Gallaher? Could he go to London? There was the&#10;furniture still to be paid for. If he could only write a book and&#10;get it published, that might open the way for him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A volume of Byron&#39;s poems lay before him on the table. He opened&#10;it cautiously with his left hand lest he should waken the child and&#10;began to read the first poem in the book:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Hushed are the winds and still the evening gloom,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Not e&#39;en a Zephyr wanders through the grove,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Whilst I return to view my Margaret&#39;s tomb&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And scatter flowers on tbe dust I love.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He paused. He felt the rhythm of the verse about him in the&#10;room. How melancholy it was! Could he, too, write like that,&#10;express the melancholy of his soul in verse? There were so many&#10;things he wanted to describe: his sensation of a few hours before&#10;on Grattan Bridge, for example. If he could get back again into&#10;that mood&#8230; .&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The child awoke and began to cry. He turned from the page and&#10;tried to hush it: but it would not be hushed. He began to rock it&#10;to and fro in his arms but its wailing cry grew keener. He rocked&#10;it faster while his eyes began to read the second stanza:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Within this narrow cell reclines her clay,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;That clay where once&#8230;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was useless. He couldn&#39;t read. He couldn&#39;t do anything. The&#10;wailing of the child pierced the drum of his ear. It was useless,&#10;useless! He was a prisoner for life. His arms trembled with anger&#10;and suddenly bending to the child&#39;s face he shouted:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Stop!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The child stopped for an instant, had a spasm of fright and&#10;began to scream. He jumped up from his chair and walked hastily up&#10;and down the room with the child in his arms. It began to sob&#10;piteously, losing its breath for four or five seconds, and then&#10;bursting out anew. The thin walls of the room echoed the sound. He&#10;tried to soothe it but it sobbed more convulsively. He looked at&#10;the contracted and quivering face of the child and began to be&#10;alarmed. He counted seven sobs without a break between them and&#10;caught the child to his breast in fright. If it died!&#8230;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The door was burst open and a young woman ran in, panting.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What is it? What is it?&#34; she cried.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The child, hearing its mother&#39;s voice, broke out into a paroxysm&#10;of sobbing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It&#39;s nothing, Annie&#38;#160;&#8230; it&#39;s nothing&#8230; . He began to cry&#8230;&#10;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She flung her parcels on the floor and snatched the child from&#10;him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What have you done to him?&#34; she cried, glaring into his&#10;face.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Little Chandler sustained for one moment the gaze of her eyes&#10;and his heart closed together as he met the hatred in them. He&#10;began to stammer:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It&#39;s nothing&#8230; . He&#38;#160;&#8230; he began to cry&#8230; . I couldn&#39;t&#38;#160;&#8230;&#10;I didn&#39;t do anything&#8230; . What?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Giving no heed to him she began to walk up and down the room,&#10;clasping the child tightly in her arms and murmuring:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My little man! My little mannie! Was &#39;ou frightened, love?&#8230;&#10;There now, love! There now!&#8230; Lambabaun! Mamma&#39;s little lamb of the&#10;world!&#8230; There now!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Little Chandler felt his cheeks suffused with shame and he stood&#10;back out of the lamplight. He listened while the paroxysm of the&#10;child&#39;s sobbing grew less and less; and tears of remorse started to&#10;his eyes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 8, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/5', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;Counterparts'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;The bell rang furiously and, when Miss Parker went to the tube,&#10;a furious voice called out in a piercing North of Ireland&#10;accent:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Send Farrington here!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Miss Parker returned to her machine, saying to a man who was&#10;writing at a desk:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Mr. Alleyne wants you upstairs.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The man muttered &#34;Blast him!&#34; under his breath and pushed back&#10;his chair to stand up. When he stood up he was tall and of great&#10;bulk. He had a hanging face, dark wine-coloured, with fair eyebrows&#10;and moustache: his eyes bulged forward slightly and the whites of&#10;them were dirty. He lifted up the counter and, passing by the&#10;clients, went out of the office with a heavy step.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He went heavily upstairs until he came to the second landing,&#10;where a door bore a brass plate with the inscription Mr. Alleyne.&#10;Here he halted, puffing with labour and vexation, and knocked. The&#10;shrill voice cried:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Come in!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The man entered Mr. Alleyne&#39;s room. Simultaneously Mr. Alleyne,&#10;a little man wearing gold-rimmed glasses on a cleanshaven face,&#10;shot his head up over a pile of documents. The head itself was so&#10;pink and hairless it seemed like a large egg reposing on the&#10;papers. Mr. Alleyne did not lose a moment:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Farrington? What is the meaning of this? Why have I always to&#10;complain of you? May I ask you why you haven&#39;t made a copy of that&#10;contract between Bodley and Kirwan? I told you it must be ready by&#10;four o&#39;clock.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But Mr. Shelley said, sir&#8212;&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Mr. Shelley said, sir&#38;#160;&#8230; . Kindly attend to what I say and&#10;not to what Mr. Shelley says, sir. You have always some excuse or&#10;another for shirking work. Let me tell you that if the contract is&#10;not copied before this evening I&#39;ll lay the matter before Mr.&#10;Crosbie&#8230; . Do you hear me now?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, sir.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Do you hear me now?&#8230; Ay and another little matter! I might as&#10;well be talking to the wall as talking to you. Understand once for&#10;all that you get a half an hour for your lunch and not an hour and&#10;a half. How many courses do you want, I&#39;d like to know&#8230; . Do you&#10;mind me now?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, sir.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Alleyne bent his head again upon his pile of papers. The man&#10;stared fixedly at the polished skull which directed the affairs of&#10;Crosbie &#38;amp; Alleyne, gauging its fragility. A spasm of rage&#10;gripped his throat for a few moments and then passed, leaving after&#10;it a sharp sensation of thirst. The man recognised the sensation&#10;and felt that he must have a good night&#39;s drinking. The middle of&#10;the month was passed and, if he could get the copy done in time,&#10;Mr. Alleyne might give him an order on the cashier. He stood still,&#10;gazing fixedly at the head upon the pile of papers. Suddenly Mr.&#10;Alleyne began to upset all the papers, searching for something.&#10;Then, as if he had been unaware of the man&#39;s presence till that&#10;moment, he shot up his head again, saying:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Eh? Are you going to stand there all day? Upon my word,&#10;Farrington, you take things easy!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I was waiting to see&#8230; &#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Very good, you needn&#39;t wait to see. Go downstairs and do your&#10;work.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The man walked heavily towards the door and, as he went out of&#10;the room, he heard Mr. Alleyne cry after him that if the contract&#10;was not copied by evening Mr. Crosbie would hear of the matter.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He returned to his desk in the lower office and counted the&#10;sheets which remained to be copied. He took up his pen and dipped&#10;it in the ink but he continued to stare stupidly at the last words&#10;he had written: In no case shall the said Bernard Bodley be&#8230; The&#10;evening was falling and in a few minutes they would be lighting the&#10;gas: then he could write. He felt that he must slake the thirst in&#10;his throat. He stood up from his desk and, lifting the counter as&#10;before, passed out of the office. As he was passing out the chief&#10;clerk looked at him inquiringly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It&#39;s all right, Mr. Shelley,&#34; said the man, pointing with his&#10;finger to indicate the objective of his journey.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The chief clerk glanced at the hat-rack, but, seeing the row&#10;complete, offered no remark. As soon as he was on the landing the&#10;man pulled a shepherd&#39;s plaid cap out of his pocket, put it on his&#10;head and ran quickly down the rickety stairs. From the street door&#10;he walked on furtively on the inner side of the path towards the&#10;corner and all at once dived into a doorway. He was now safe in the&#10;dark snug of O&#39;Neill&#39;s shop, and filling up the little window that&#10;looked into the bar with his inflamed face, the colour of dark wine&#10;or dark meat, he called out:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Here, Pat, give us a g.p.. like a good fellow.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The curate brought him a glass of plain porter. The man drank it&#10;at a gulp and asked for a caraway seed. He put his penny on the&#10;counter and, leaving the curate to grope for it in the gloom,&#10;retreated out of the snug as furtively as he had entered it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Darkness, accompanied by a thick fog, was gaining upon the dusk&#10;of February and the lamps in Eustace Street had been lit. The man&#10;went up by the houses until he reached the door of the office,&#10;wondering whether he could finish his copy in time. On the stairs a&#10;moist pungent odour of perfumes saluted his nose: evidently Miss&#10;Delacour had come while he was out in O&#39;Neill&#39;s. He crammed his cap&#10;back again into his pocket and re-entered the office, assuming an&#10;air of absentmindedness.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Mr. Alleyne has been calling for you,&#34; said the chief clerk&#10;severely. &#34;Where were you?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The man glanced at the two clients who were standing at the&#10;counter as if to intimate that their presence prevented him from&#10;answering. As the clients were both male the chief clerk allowed&#10;himself a laugh.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I know that game,&#34; he said. &#34;Five times in one day is a little&#10;bit&#8230; Well, you better look sharp and get a copy of our&#10;correspondence in the Delacour case for Mr. Alleyne.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;This address in the presence of the public, his run upstairs and&#10;the porter he had gulped down so hastily confused the man and, as&#10;he sat down at his desk to get what was required, he realised how&#10;hopeless was the task of finishing his copy of the contract before&#10;half past five. The dark damp night was coming and he longed to&#10;spend it in the bars, drinking with his friends amid the glare of&#10;gas and the clatter of glasses. He got out the Delacour&#10;correspondence and passed out of the office. He hoped Mr. Alleyne&#10;would not discover that the last two letters were missing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The moist pungent perfume lay all the way up to Mr. Alleyne&#39;s&#10;room. Miss Delacour was a middle-aged woman of Jewish appearance.&#10;Mr. Alleyne was said to be sweet on her or on her money. She came&#10;to the office often and stayed a long time when she came. She was&#10;sitting beside his desk now in an aroma of perfumes, smoothing the&#10;handle of her umbrella and nodding the great black feather in her&#10;hat. Mr. Alleyne had swivelled his chair round to face her and&#10;thrown his right foot jauntily upon his left knee. The man put the&#10;correspondence on the desk and bowed respectfully but neither Mr.&#10;Alleyne nor Miss Delacour took any notice of his bow. Mr. Alleyne&#10;tapped a finger on the correspondence and then flicked it towards&#10;him as if to say: &#34;That&#39;s all right: you can go.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The man returned to the lower office and sat down again at his&#10;desk. He stared intently at the incomplete phrase: In no case shall&#10;the said Bernard Bodley be&#8230; and thought how strange it was that the&#10;last three words began with the same letter. The chief clerk began&#10;to hurry Miss Parker, saying she would never have the letters typed&#10;in time for post. The man listened to the clicking of the machine&#10;for a few minutes and then set to work to finish his copy. But his&#10;head was not clear and his mind wandered away to the glare and&#10;rattle of the public-house. It was a night for hot punches. He&#10;struggled on with his copy, but when the clock struck five he had&#10;still fourteen pages to write. Blast it! He couldn&#39;t finish it in&#10;time. He longed to execrate aloud, to bring his fist down on&#10;something violently. He was so enraged that he wrote Bernard&#10;Bernard instead of Bernard Bodley and had to begin again on a clean&#10;sheet.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He felt strong enough to clear out the whole office&#10;singlehanded. His body ached to do something, to rush out and revel&#10;in violence. All the indignities of his life enraged him&#8230; . Could&#10;he ask the cashier privately for an advance? No, the cashier was no&#10;good, no damn good: he wouldn&#39;t give an advance&#8230; . He knew where he&#10;would meet the boys: Leonard and O&#39;Halloran and Nosey Flynn. The&#10;barometer of his emotional nature was set for a spell of riot.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;His imagination had so abstracted him that his name was called&#10;twice before he answered. Mr. Alleyne and Miss Delacour were&#10;standing outside the counter and all the clerks had turn round in&#10;anticipation of something. The man got up from his desk. Mr.&#10;Alleyne began a tirade of abuse, saying that two letters were&#10;missing. The man answered that he knew nothing about them, that he&#10;had made a faithful copy. The tirade continued: it was so bitter&#10;and violent that the man could hardly restrain his fist from&#10;descending upon the head of the manikin before him:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I know nothing about any other two letters,&#34; he said&#10;stupidly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You&#8212;know&#8212;nothing. Of course you know nothing,&#34; said Mr.&#10;Alleyne. &#34;Tell me,&#34; he added, glancing first for approval to the&#10;lady beside him, &#34;do you take me for a fool? Do you think me an&#10;utter fool?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The man glanced from the lady&#39;s face to the little egg-shaped&#10;head and back again; and, almost before he was aware of it, his&#10;tongue had found a felicitous moment:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I don&#39;t think, sir,&#34; he said, &#34;that that&#39;s a fair question to&#10;put to me.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There was a pause in the very breathing of the clerks. Everyone&#10;was astounded (the author of the witticism no less than his&#10;neighbours) and Miss Delacour, who was a stout amiable person,&#10;began to smile broadly. Mr. Alleyne flushed to the hue of a wild&#10;rose and his mouth twitched with a dwarf s passion. He shook his&#10;fist in the man&#39;s face till it seemed to vibrate like the knob of&#10;some electric machine:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You impertinent ruffian! You impertinent ruffian! I&#39;ll make&#10;short work of you! Wait till you see! You&#39;ll apologise to me for&#10;your impertinence or you&#39;ll quit the office instanter! You&#39;ll quit&#10;this, I&#39;m telling you, or you&#39;ll apologise to me!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He stood in a doorway opposite the office watching to see if the&#10;cashier would come out alone. All the clerks passed out and finally&#10;the cashier came out with the chief clerk. It was no use trying to&#10;say a word to him when he was with the chief clerk. The man felt&#10;that his position was bad enough. He had been obliged to offer an&#10;abject apology to Mr. Alleyne for his impertinence but he knew what&#10;a hornet&#39;s nest the office would be for him. He could remember the&#10;way in which Mr. Alleyne had hounded little Peake out of the office&#10;in order to make room for his own nephew. He felt savage and&#10;thirsty and revengeful, annoyed with himself and with everyone&#10;else. Mr. Alleyne would never give him an hour&#39;s rest; his life&#10;would be a hell to him. He had made a proper fool of himself this&#10;time. Could he not keep his tongue in his cheek? But they had never&#10;pulled together from the first, he and Mr. Alleyne, ever since the&#10;day Mr. Alleyne had overheard him mimicking his North of Ireland&#10;accent to amuse Higgins and Miss Parker: that had been the&#10;beginning of it. He might have tried Higgins for the money, but&#10;sure Higgins never had anything for himself. A man with two&#10;establishments to keep up, of course he couldn&#39;t&#8230; .&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He felt his great body again aching for the comfort of the&#10;public-house. The fog had begun to chill him and he wondered could&#10;he touch Pat in O&#39;Neill&#39;s. He could not touch him for more than a&#10;bob&#8212;and a bob was no use. Yet he must get money somewhere or other:&#10;he had spent his last penny for the g.p. and soon it would be too&#10;late for getting money anywhere. Suddenly, as he was fingering his&#10;watch-chain, he thought of Terry Kelly&#39;s pawn-office in Fleet&#10;Street. That was the dart! Why didn&#39;t he think of it sooner?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He went through the narrow alley of Temple Bar quickly,&#10;muttering to himself that they could all go to hell because he was&#10;going to have a good night of it. The clerk in Terry Kelly&#39;s said A&#10;crown! but the consignor held out for six shillings; and in the end&#10;the six shillings was allowed him literally. He came out of the&#10;pawn-office joyfully, making a little cylinder, of the coins&#10;between his thumb and fingers. In Westmoreland Street the footpaths&#10;were crowded with young men and women returning from business and&#10;ragged urchins ran here and there yelling out the names of the&#10;evening editions. The man passed through the crowd, looking on the&#10;spectacle generally with proud satisfaction and staring masterfully&#10;at the office-girls. His head was full of the noises of tram- gongs&#10;and swishing trolleys and his nose already sniffed the curling&#10;fumes punch. As he walked on he preconsidered the terms in which he&#10;would narrate the incident to the boys:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;So, I just looked at him&#8212;coolly, you know, and looked at her.&#10;Then I looked back at him again&#8212;taking my time, you know. &#39;I don&#39;t&#10;think that that&#39;s a fair question to put to me,&#39; says I.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Nosey Flynn was sitting up in his usual corner of Davy Byrne&#39;s&#10;and, when he heard the story, he stood Farrington a half-one,&#10;saying it was as smart a thing as ever he heard. Farrington stood a&#10;drink in his turn. After a while O&#39;Halloran and Paddy Leonard came&#10;in and the story was repeated to them. O&#39;Halloran stood tailors of&#10;malt, hot, all round and told the story of the retort he had made&#10;to the chief clerk when he was in Callan&#39;s of Fownes&#39;s Street; but,&#10;as the retort was after the manner of the liberal shepherds in the&#10;eclogues, he had to admit that it was not as clever as Farrington&#39;s&#10;retort. At this Farrington told the boys to polish off that and&#10;have another.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Just as they were naming their poisons who should come in but&#10;Higgins! Of course he had to join in with the others. The men asked&#10;him to give his version of it, and he did so with great vivacity&#10;for the sight of five small hot whiskies was very exhilarating.&#10;Everyone roared laughing when he showed the way in which Mr.&#10;Alleyne shook his fist in Farrington&#39;s face. Then he imitated&#10;Farrington, saying, &#34;And here was my nabs, as cool as you please,&#34;&#10;while Farrington looked at the company out of his heavy dirty eyes,&#10;smiling and at times drawing forth stray drops of liquor from his&#10;moustache with the aid of his lower lip.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When that round was over there was a pause. O&#39;Halloran had money&#10;but neither of the other two seemed to have any; so the whole party&#10;left the shop somewhat regretfully. At the corner of Duke Street&#10;Higgins and Nosey Flynn bevelled off to the left while the other&#10;three turned back towards the city. Rain was drizzling down on the&#10;cold streets and, when they reached the Ballast Office, Farrington&#10;suggested the Scotch House. The bar was full of men and loud with&#10;the noise of tongues and glasses. The three men pushed past the&#10;whining matchsellers at the door and formed a little party at the&#10;corner of the counter. They began to exchange stories. Leonard&#10;introduced them to a young fellow named Weathers who was performing&#10;at the Tivoli as an acrobat and knockabout artiste. Farrington&#10;stood a drink all round. Weathers said he would take a small Irish&#10;and Apollinaris. Farrington, who had definite notions of what was&#10;what, asked the boys would they have an Apollinaris too; but the&#10;boys told Tim to make theirs hot. The talk became theatrical.&#10;O&#39;Halloran stood a round and then Farrington stood another round,&#10;Weathers protesting that the hospitality was too Irish. He promised&#10;to get them in behind the scenes and introduce them to some nice&#10;girls. O&#39;Halloran said that he and Leonard would go, but that&#10;Farrington wouldn&#39;t go because he was a married man; and&#10;Farrington&#39;s heavy dirty eyes leered at the company in token that&#10;he understood he was being chaffed. Weathers made them all have&#10;just one little tincture at his expense and promised to meet them&#10;later on at Mulligan&#39;s in Poolbeg Street.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When the Scotch House closed they went round to Mulligan&#39;s. They&#10;went into the parlour at the back and O&#39;Halloran ordered small hot&#10;specials all round. They were all beginning to feel mellow.&#10;Farrington was just standing another round when Weathers came back.&#10;Much to Farrington&#39;s relief he drank a glass of bitter this time.&#10;Funds were getting low but they had enough to keep them going.&#10;Presently two young women with big hats and a young man in a check&#10;suit came in and sat at a table close by. Weathers saluted them and&#10;told the company that they were out of the Tivoli. Farrington&#39;s&#10;eyes wandered at every moment in the direction of one of the young&#10;women. There was something striking in her appearance. An immense&#10;scarf of peacock-blue muslin was wound round her hat and knotted in&#10;a great bow under her chin; and she wore bright yellow gloves,&#10;reaching to the elbow. Farrington gazed admiringly at the plump arm&#10;which she moved very often and with much grace; and when, after a&#10;little time, she answered his gaze he admired still more her large&#10;dark brown eyes. The oblique staring expression in them fascinated&#10;him. She glanced at him once or twice and, when the party was&#10;leaving the room, she brushed against his chair and said &#34;O,&#10;pardon!&#34; in a London accent. He watched her leave the room in the&#10;hope that she would look back at him, but he was disappointed. He&#10;cursed his want of money and cursed all the rounds he had stood,&#10;particularly all the whiskies and Apolinaris which he had stood to&#10;Weathers. If there was one thing that he hated it was a sponge. He&#10;was so angry that he lost count of the conversation of his&#10;friends.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When Paddy Leonard called him he found that they were talking&#10;about feats of strength. Weathers was showing his biceps muscle to&#10;the company and boasting so much that the other two had called on&#10;Farrington to uphold the national honour. Farrington pulled up his&#10;sleeve accordingly and showed his biceps muscle to the company. The&#10;two arms were examined and compared and finally it was agreed to&#10;have a trial of strength. The table was cleared and the two men&#10;rested their elbows on it, clasping hands. When Paddy Leonard said&#10;&#34;Go!&#34; each was to try to bring down the other&#39;s hand on to the&#10;table. Farrington looked very serious and determined.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The trial began. After about thirty seconds Weathers brought his&#10;opponent&#39;s hand slowly down on to the table. Farrington&#39;s dark&#10;wine-coloured face flushed darker still with anger and humiliation&#10;at having been defeated by such a stripling.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You&#39;re not to put the weight of your body behind it. Play&#10;fair,&#34; he said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Who&#39;s not playing fair?&#34; said the other.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Come on again. The two best out of three.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The trial began again. The veins stood out on Farrington&#39;s&#10;forehead, and the pallor of Weathers&#39; complexion changed to peony.&#10;Their hands and arms trembled under the stress. After a long&#10;struggle Weathers again brought his opponent&#39;s hand slowly on to&#10;the table. There was a murmur of applause from the spectators. The&#10;curate, who was standing beside the table, nodded his red head&#10;towards the victor and said with stupid familiarity:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ah! that&#39;s the knack!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What the hell do you know about it?&#34; said Farrington fiercely,&#10;turning on the man. &#34;What do you put in your gab for?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Sh, sh!&#34; said O&#39;Halloran, observing the violent expression of&#10;Farrington&#39;s face. &#34;Pony up, boys. We&#39;ll have just one little&#10;smahan more and then we&#39;ll be off.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A very sullen-faced man stood at the corner of O&#39;Connell Bridge&#10;waiting for the little Sandymount tram to take him home. He was&#10;full of smouldering anger and revengefulness. He felt humiliated&#10;and discontented; he did not even feel drunk; and he had only&#10;twopence in his pocket. He cursed everything. He had done for&#10;himself in the office, pawned his watch, spent all his money; and&#10;he had not even got drunk. He began to feel thirsty again and he&#10;longed to be back again in the hot reeking public-house. He had&#10;lost his reputation as a strong man, having been defeated twice by&#10;a mere boy. His heart swelled with fury and, when he thought of the&#10;woman in the big hat who had brushed against him and said Pardon!&#10;his fury nearly choked him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;His tram let him down at Shelbourne Road and he steered his&#10;great body along in the shadow of the wall of the barracks. He&#10;loathed returning to his home. When he went in by the side- door he&#10;found the kitchen empty and the kitchen fire nearly out. He bawled&#10;upstairs:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ada! Ada!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;His wife was a little sharp-faced woman who bullied her husband&#10;when he was sober and was bullied by him when he was drunk. They&#10;had five children. A little boy came running down the stairs.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Who is that?&#34; said the man, peering through the darkness.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Me, pa.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Who are you? Charlie?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No, pa. Tom.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Where&#39;s your mother?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;She&#39;s out at the chapel.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That&#39;s right&#8230; . Did she think of leaving any dinner for&#10;me?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, pa. I &#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Light the lamp. What do you mean by having the place in&#10;darkness? Are the other children in bed?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The man sat down heavily on one of the chairs while the little&#10;boy lit the lamp. He began to mimic his son&#39;s flat accent, saying&#10;half to himself: &#34;At the chapel. At the chapel, if you please!&#34;&#10;When the lamp was lit he banged his fist on the table and&#10;shouted:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What&#39;s for my dinner?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I&#39;m going&#8230; to cook it, pa,&#34; said the little boy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The man jumped up furiously and pointed to the fire.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;On that fire! You let the fire out! By God, I&#39;ll teach you to&#10;do that again!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He took a step to the door and seized the walking-stick which&#10;was standing behind it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I&#39;ll teach you to let the fire out!&#34; he said, rolling up his&#10;sleeve in order to give his arm free play.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The little boy cried &#34;O, pa!&#34; and ran whimpering round the&#10;table, but the man followed him and caught him by the coat. The&#10;little boy looked about him wildly but, seeing no way of escape,&#10;fell upon his knees.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Now, you&#39;ll let the fire out the next time!&#34; said the man&#10;striking at him vigorously with the stick. &#34;Take that, you little&#10;whelp!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The boy uttered a squeal of pain as the stick cut his thigh. He&#10;clasped his hands together in the air and his voice shook with&#10;fright.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O, pa!&#34; he cried. &#34;Don&#39;t beat me, pa! And I&#39;ll&#8230; I&#39;ll say a Hail&#10;Mary for you&#8230; . I&#39;ll say a Hail Mary for you, pa, if you don&#39;t beat&#10;me&#8230; . I&#39;ll say a Hail Mary&#8230; .&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 8, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/5', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;Clay'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;THE matron had given her leave to go out as soon as the women&#39;s&#10;tea was over and Maria looked forward to her evening out. The&#10;kitchen was spick and span: the cook said you could see yourself in&#10;the big copper boilers. The fire was nice and bright and on one of&#10;the side-tables were four very big barmbracks. These barmbracks&#10;seemed uncut; but if you went closer you would see that they had&#10;been cut into long thick even slices and were ready to be handed&#10;round at tea. Maria had cut them herself.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Maria was a very, very small person indeed but she had a very&#10;long nose and a very long chin. She talked a little through her&#10;nose, always soothingly: &#34;Yes, my dear,&#34; and &#34;No, my dear.&#34; She was&#10;always sent for when the women quarrelled Over their tubs and&#10;always succeeded in making peace. One day the matron had said to&#10;her:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Maria, you are a veritable peace-maker!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And the sub-matron and two of the Board ladies had heard the&#10;compliment. And Ginger Mooney was always saying what she wouldn&#39;t&#10;do to the dummy who had charge of the irons if it wasn&#39;t for Maria.&#10;Everyone was so fond of Maria.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The women would have their tea at six o&#39;clock and she would be&#10;able to get away before seven. From Ballsbridge to the Pillar,&#10;twenty minutes; from the Pillar to Drumcondra, twenty minutes; and&#10;twenty minutes to buy the things. She would be there before eight.&#10;She took out her purse with the silver clasps and read again the&#10;words A Present from Belfast. She was very fond of that purse&#10;because Joe had brought it to her five years before when he and&#10;Alphy had gone to Belfast on a Whit-Monday trip. In the purse were&#10;two half-crowns and some coppers. She would have five shillings&#10;clear after paying tram fare. What a nice evening they would have,&#10;all the children singing! Only she hoped that Joe wouldn&#39;t come in&#10;drunk. He was so different when he took any drink.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Often he had wanted her to go and live with them;-but she would&#10;have felt herself in the way (though Joe&#39;s wife was ever so nice&#10;with her) and she had become accustomed to the life of the laundry.&#10;Joe was a good fellow. She had nursed him and Alphy too; and Joe&#10;used often say:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Mamma is mamma but Maria is my proper mother.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;After the break-up at home the boys had got her that position in&#10;the Dublin by Lamplight laundry, and she liked it. She used to have&#10;such a bad opinion of Protestants but now she thought they were&#10;very nice people, a little quiet and serious, but still very nice&#10;people to live with. Then she had her plants in the conservatory&#10;and she liked looking after them. She had lovely ferns and&#10;wax-plants and, whenever anyone came to visit her, she always gave&#10;the visitor one or two slips from her conservatory. There was one&#10;thing she didn&#39;t like and that was the tracts on the walks; but the&#10;matron was such a nice person to deal with, so genteel.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When the cook told her everything was ready she went into the&#10;women&#39;s room and began to pull the big bell. In a few minutes the&#10;women began to come in by twos and threes, wiping their steaming&#10;hands in their petticoats and pulling down the sleeves of their&#10;blouses over their red steaming arms. They settled down before&#10;their huge mugs which the cook and the dummy filled up with hot&#10;tea, already mixed with milk and sugar in huge tin cans. Maria&#10;superintended the distribution of the barmbrack and saw that every&#10;woman got her four slices. There was a great deal of laughing and&#10;joking during the meal. Lizzie Fleming said Maria was sure to get&#10;the ring and, though Fleming had said that for so many Hallow Eves,&#10;Maria had to laugh and say she didn&#39;t want any ring or man either;&#10;and when she laughed her grey-green eyes sparkled with disappointed&#10;shyness and the tip of her nose nearly met the tip of her chin.&#10;Then Ginger Mooney lifted her mug of tea and proposed Maria&#39;s&#10;health while all the other women clattered with their mugs on the&#10;table, and said she was sorry she hadn&#39;t a sup of porter to drink&#10;it in. And Maria laughed again till the tip of her nose nearly met&#10;the tip of her chin and till her minute body nearly shook itself&#10;asunder because she knew that Mooney meant well though, of course,&#10;she had the notions of a common woman.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But wasn&#39;t Maria glad when the women had finished their tea and&#10;the cook and the dummy had begun to clear away the tea- things! She&#10;went into her little bedroom and, remembering that the next morning&#10;was a mass morning, changed the hand of the alarm from seven to&#10;six. Then she took off her working skirt and her house-boots and&#10;laid her best skirt out on the bed and her tiny dress-boots beside&#10;the foot of the bed. She changed her blouse too and, as she stood&#10;before the mirror, she thought of how she used to dress for mass on&#10;Sunday morning when she was a young girl; and she looked with&#10;quaint affection at the diminutive body which she had so often&#10;adorned, In spite of its years she found it a nice tidy little&#10;body.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When she got outside the streets were shining with rain and she&#10;was glad of her old brown waterproof. The tram was full and she had&#10;to sit on the little stool at the end of the car, facing all the&#10;people, with her toes barely touching the floor. She arranged in&#10;her mind all she was going to do and thought how much better it was&#10;to be independent and to have your own money in your pocket. She&#10;hoped they would have a nice evening. She was sure they would but&#10;she could not help thinking what a pity it was Alphy and Joe were&#10;not speaking. They were always falling out now but when they were&#10;boys together they used to be the best of friends: but such was&#10;life.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She got out of her tram at the Pillar and ferreted her way&#10;quickly among the crowds. She went into Downes&#39;s cake-shop but the&#10;shop was so full of people that it was a long time before she could&#10;get herself attended to. She bought a dozen of mixed penny cakes,&#10;and at last came out of the shop laden with a big bag. Then she&#10;thought what else would she buy: she wanted to buy something really&#10;nice. They would be sure to have plenty of apples and nuts. It was&#10;hard to know what to buy and all she could think of was cake. She&#10;decided to buy some plumcake but Downes&#39;s plumcake had not enough&#10;almond icing on top of it so she went over to a shop in Henry&#10;Street. Here she was a long time in suiting herself and the stylish&#10;young lady behind the counter, who was evidently a little annoyed&#10;by her, asked her was it wedding-cake she wanted to buy. That made&#10;Maria blush and smile at the young lady; but the young lady took it&#10;all very seriously and finally cut a thick slice of plumcake,&#10;parcelled it up and said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Two-and-four, please.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She thought she would have to stand in the Drumcondra tram&#10;because none of the young men seemed to notice her but an elderly&#10;gentleman made room for her. He was a stout gentleman and he wore a&#10;brown hard hat; he had a square red face and a greyish moustache.&#10;Maria thought he was a colonel-looking gentleman and she reflected&#10;how much more polite he was than the young men who simply stared&#10;straight before them. The gentleman began to chat with her about&#10;Hallow Eve and the rainy weather. He supposed the bag was full of&#10;good things for the little ones and said it was only right that the&#10;youngsters should enjoy themselves while they were young. Maria&#10;agreed with him and favoured him with demure nods and hems. He was&#10;very nice with her, and when she was getting out at the Canal&#10;Bridge she thanked him and bowed, and he bowed to her and raised&#10;his hat and smiled agreeably, and while she was going up along the&#10;terrace, bending her tiny head under the rain, she thought how easy&#10;it was to know a gentleman even when he has a drop taken.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Everybody said: &#34;0, here&#39;s Maria!&#34; when she came to Joe&#39;s house.&#10;Joe was there, having come home from business, and all the children&#10;had their Sunday dresses on. There were two big girls in from next&#10;door and games were going on. Maria gave the bag of cakes to the&#10;eldest boy, Alphy, to divide and Mrs. Donnelly said it was too good&#10;of her to bring such a big bag of cakes and made all the children&#10;say:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Thanks, Maria.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But Maria said she had brought something special for papa and&#10;mamma, something they would be sure to like, and she began to look&#10;for her plumcake. She tried in Downes&#39;s bag and then in the pockets&#10;of her waterproof and then on the hallstand but nowhere could she&#10;find it. Then she asked all the children had any of them eaten it &#8212;&#10;by mistake, of course &#8212; but the children all said no and looked as&#10;if they did not like to eat cakes if they were to be accused of&#10;stealing. Everybody had a solution for the mystery and Mrs.&#10;Donnelly said it was plain that Maria had left it behind her in the&#10;tram. Maria, remembering how confused the gentleman with the&#10;greyish moustache had made her, coloured with shame and vexation&#10;and disappointment. At the thought of the failure of her little&#10;surprise and of the two and fourpence she had thrown away for&#10;nothing she nearly cried outright.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But Joe said it didn&#39;t matter and made her sit down by the fire.&#10;He was very nice with her. He told her all that went on in his&#10;office, repeating for her a smart answer which he had made to the&#10;manager. Maria did not understand why Joe laughed so much over the&#10;answer he had made but she said that the manager must have been a&#10;very overbearing person to deal with. Joe said he wasn&#39;t so bad&#10;when you knew how to take him, that he was a decent sort so long as&#10;you didn&#39;t rub him the wrong way. Mrs. Donnelly played the piano&#10;for the children and they danced and sang. Then the two next-door&#10;girls handed round the nuts. Nobody could find the nutcrackers and&#10;Joe was nearly getting cross over it and asked how did they expect&#10;Maria to crack nuts without a nutcracker. But Maria said she didn&#39;t&#10;like nuts and that they weren&#39;t to bother about her. Then Joe asked&#10;would she take a bottle of stout and Mrs. Donnelly said there was&#10;port wine too in the house if she would prefer that. Maria said she&#10;would rather they didn&#39;t ask her to take anything: but Joe&#10;insisted.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So Maria let him have his way and they sat by the fire talking&#10;over old times and Maria thought she would put in a good word for&#10;Alphy. But Joe cried that God might strike him stone dead if ever&#10;he spoke a word to his brother again and Maria said she was sorry&#10;she had mentioned the matter. Mrs. Donnelly told her husband it was&#10;a great shame for him to speak that way of his own flesh and blood&#10;but Joe said that Alphy was no brother of his and there was nearly&#10;being a row on the head of it. But Joe said he would not lose his&#10;temper on account of the night it was and asked his wife to open&#10;some more stout. The two next-door girls had arranged some Hallow&#10;Eve games and soon everything was merry again. Maria was delighted&#10;to see the children so merry and Joe and his wife in such good&#10;spirits. The next-door girls put some saucers on the table and then&#10;led the children up to the table, blindfold. One got the&#10;prayer-book and the other three got the water; and when one of the&#10;next-door girls got the ring Mrs. Donnelly shook her finger at the&#10;blushing girl as much as to say: 0, I know all about it! They&#10;insisted then on blindfolding Maria and leading her up to the table&#10;to see what she would get; and, while they were putting on the&#10;bandage, Maria laughed and laughed again till the tip of her nose&#10;nearly met the tip of her chin.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;They led her up to the table amid laughing and joking and she&#10;put her hand out in the air as she was told to do. She moved her&#10;hand about here and there in the air and descended on one of the&#10;saucers. She felt a soft wet substance with her fingers and was&#10;surprised that nobody spoke or took off her bandage. There was a&#10;pause for a few seconds; and then a great deal of scuffling and&#10;whispering. Somebody said something about the garden, and at last&#10;Mrs. Donnelly said something very cross to one of the next-door&#10;girls and told her to throw it out at once: that was no play. Maria&#10;understood that it was wrong that time and so she had to do it over&#10;again: and this time she got the prayer-book.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;After that Mrs. Donnelly played Miss McCloud&#39;s Reel for the&#10;children and Joe made Maria take a glass of wine. Soon they were&#10;all quite merry again and Mrs. Donnelly said Maria would enter a&#10;convent before the year was out because she had got the&#10;prayer-book. Maria had never seen Joe so nice to her as he was that&#10;night, so full of pleasant talk and reminiscences. She said they&#10;were all very good to her.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At last the children grew tired and sleepy and Joe asked Maria&#10;would she not sing some little song before she went, one of the old&#10;songs. Mrs. Donnelly said &#34;Do, please, Maria!&#34; and so Maria had to&#10;get up and stand beside the piano. Mrs. Donnelly bade the children&#10;be quiet and listen to Maria&#39;s song. Then she played the prelude&#10;and said &#34;Now, Maria!&#34; and Maria, blushing very much began to sing&#10;in a tiny quavering voice. She sang I Dreamt that I Dwelt, and when&#10;she came to the second verse she sang again:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I dreamt that I dwelt in marble halls&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;? With vassals and serfs at my side,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And of all who assembled within those walls&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;? That I was the hope and the pride.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I had riches too great to count; could boast&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;? Of a high ancestral name,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But I also dreamt, which pleased me most,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;? That you loved me still the same.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But no one tried to show her her mistake; and when she had ended&#10;her song Joe was very much moved. He said that there was no time&#10;like the long ago and no music for him like poor old Balfe,&#10;whatever other people might say; and his eyes filled up so much&#10;with tears that he could not find what he was looking for and in&#10;the end he had to ask his wife to tell him where the corkscrew&#10;was.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 8, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/5', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode(' A&#10;Painful Case'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;MR. JAMES DUFFY lived in Chapelizod because he wished to live as&#10;far as possible from the city of which he was a citizen and because&#10;he found all the other suburbs of Dublin mean, modern and&#10;pretentious. He lived in an old sombre house and from his windows&#10;he could look into the disused distillery or upwards along the&#10;shallow river on which Dublin is built. The lofty walls of his&#10;uncarpeted room were free from pictures. He had himself bought&#10;every article of furniture in the room: a black iron bedstead, an&#10;iron washstand, four cane chairs, a clothes- rack, a coal-scuttle,&#10;a fender and irons and a square table on which lay a double desk. A&#10;bookcase had been made in an alcove by means of shelves of white&#10;wood. The bed was clothed with white bedclothes and a black and&#10;scarlet rug covered the foot. A little hand-mirror hung above the&#10;washstand and during the day a white-shaded lamp stood as the sole&#10;ornament of the mantelpiece. The books on the white wooden shelves&#10;were arranged from below upwards according to bulk. A complete&#10;Wordsworth stood at one end of the lowest shelf and a copy of the&#10;Maynooth Catechism, sewn into the cloth cover of a notebook, stood&#10;at one end of the top shelf. Writing materials were always on the&#10;desk. In the desk lay a manuscript translation of Hauptmann&#39;s&#10;Michael Kramer, the stage directions of which were written in&#10;purple ink, and a little sheaf of papers held together by a brass&#10;pin. In these sheets a sentence was inscribed from time to time&#10;and, in an ironical moment, the headline of an advertisement for&#10;Bile Beans had been pasted on to the first sheet. On lifting the&#10;lid of the desk a faint fragrance escaped&#8212;the fragrance of new&#10;cedarwood pencils or of a bottle of gum or of an overripe apple&#10;which might have been left there and forgotten.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Duffy abhorred anything which betokened physical or mental&#10;disorder. A medival doctor would have called him saturnine. His&#10;face, which carried the entire tale of his years, was of the brown&#10;tint of Dublin streets. On his long and rather large head grew dry&#10;black hair and a tawny moustache did not quite cover an unamiable&#10;mouth. His cheekbones also gave his face a harsh character; but&#10;there was no harshness in the eyes which, looking at the world from&#10;under their tawny eyebrows, gave the impression of a man ever alert&#10;to greet a redeeming instinct in others but often disappointed. He&#10;lived at a little distance from his body, regarding his own acts&#10;with doubtful side-glasses. He had an odd autobiographical habit&#10;which led him to compose in his mind from time to time a short&#10;sentence about himself containing a subject in the third person and&#10;a predicate in the past tense. He never gave alms to beggars and&#10;walked firmly, carrying a stout hazel.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He had been for many years cashier of a private bank in Baggot&#10;Street. Every morning he came in from Chapelizod by tram. At midday&#10;he went to Dan Burke&#39;s and took his lunch&#8212;a bottle of lager beer&#10;and a small trayful of arrowroot biscuits. At four o&#39;clock he was&#10;set free. He dined in an eating-house in George&#39;s Street where he&#10;felt himself safe from the society o Dublin&#39;s gilded youth and&#10;where there was a certain plain honesty in the bill of fare. His&#10;evenings were spent either before his landlady&#39;s piano or roaming&#10;about the outskirts of the city. His liking for Mozart&#39;s music&#10;brought him sometimes to an opera or a concert: these were the only&#10;dissipations of his life.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He had neither companions nor friends, church nor creed. He&#10;lived his spiritual life without any communion with others,&#10;visiting his relatives at Christmas and escorting them to the&#10;cemetery when they died. He performed these two social duties for&#10;old dignity&#39;s sake but conceded nothing further to the conventions&#10;which regulate the civic life. He allowed himself to think that in&#10;certain circumstances he would rob his hank but, as these&#10;circumstances never arose, his life rolled out evenly&#8212;an&#10;adventureless tale.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;One evening he found himself sitting beside two ladies in the&#10;Rotunda. The house, thinly peopled and silent, gave distressing&#10;prophecy of failure. The lady who sat next him looked round at the&#10;deserted house once or twice and then said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What a pity there is such a poor house tonight! It&#39;s so hard on&#10;people to have to sing to empty benches.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He took the remark as an invitation to talk. He was surprised&#10;that she seemed so little awkward. While they talked he tried to&#10;fix her permanently in his memory. When he learned that the young&#10;girl beside her was her daughter he judged her to be a year or so&#10;younger than himself. Her face, which must have been handsome, had&#10;remained intelligent. It was an oval face with strongly marked&#10;features. The eyes were very dark blue and steady. Their gaze began&#10;with a defiant note but was confused by what seemed a deliberate&#10;swoon of the pupil into the iris, revealing for an instant a&#10;temperament of great sensibility. The pupil reasserted itself&#10;quickly, this half- disclosed nature fell again under the reign of&#10;prudence, and her astrakhan jacket, moulding a bosom of a certain&#10;fullness, struck the note of defiance more definitely.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He met her again a few weeks afterwards at a concert in&#10;Earlsfort Terrace and seized the moments when her daughter&#39;s&#10;attention was diverted to become intimate. She alluded once or&#10;twice to her husband but her tone was not such as to make the&#10;allusion a warning. Her name was Mrs. Sinico. Her husband&#39;s&#10;great-great-grandfather had come from Leghorn. Her husband was&#10;captain of a mercantile boat plying between Dublin and Holland; and&#10;they had one child.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Meeting her a third time by accident he found courage to make an&#10;appointment. She came. This was the first of many meetings; they&#10;met always in the evening and chose the most quiet quarters for&#10;their walks together. Mr. Duffy, however, had a distaste for&#10;underhand ways and, finding that they were compelled to meet&#10;stealthily, he forced her to ask him to her house. Captain Sinico&#10;encouraged his visits, thinking that his daughter&#39;s hand was in&#10;question. He had dismissed his wife so sincerely from his gallery&#10;of pleasures that he did not suspect that anyone else would take an&#10;interest in her. As the husband was often away and the daughter out&#10;giving music lessons Mr. Duffy had many opportunities of enjoying&#10;the lady&#39;s society. Neither he nor she had had any such adventure&#10;before and neither was conscious of any incongruity. Little by&#10;little he entangled his thoughts with hers. He lent her books,&#10;provided her with ideas, shared his intellectual life with her. She&#10;listened to all.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Sometimes in return for his theories she gave out some fact of&#10;her own life. With almost maternal solicitude she urged him to let&#10;his nature open to the full: she became his confessor. He told her&#10;that for some time he had assisted at the meetings of an Irish&#10;Socialist Party where he had felt himself a unique figure amidst a&#10;score of sober workmen in a garret lit by an inefficient oil-lamp.&#10;When the party had divided into three sections, each under its own&#10;leader and in its own garret, he had discontinued his attendances.&#10;The workmen&#39;s discussions, he said, were too timorous; the interest&#10;they took in the question of wages was inordinate. He felt that&#10;they were hard-featured realists and that they resented an&#10;exactitude which was the produce of a leisure not within their&#10;reach. No social revolution, he told her, would be likely to strike&#10;Dublin for some centuries.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She asked him why did he not write out his thoughts. For what,&#10;he asked her, with careful scorn. To compete with phrasemongers,&#10;incapable of thinking consecutively for sixty seconds? To submit&#10;himself to the criticisms of an obtuse middle class which entrusted&#10;its morality to policemen and its fine arts to impresarios?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He went often to her little cottage outside Dublin; often they&#10;spent their evenings alone. Little by little, as their thoughts&#10;entangled, they spoke of subjects less remote. Her companionship&#10;was like a warm soil about an exotic. Many times she allowed the&#10;dark to fall upon them, refraining from lighting the lamp. The dark&#10;discreet room, their isolation, the music that still vibrated in&#10;their ears united them. This union exalted him, wore away the rough&#10;edges of his character, emotionalised his mental life. Sometimes he&#10;caught himself listening to the sound of his own voice. He thought&#10;that in her eyes he would ascend to an angelical stature; and, as&#10;he attached the fervent nature of his companion more and more&#10;closely to him, he heard the strange impersonal voice which he&#10;recognised as his own, insisting on the soul&#39;s incurable&#10;loneliness. We cannot give ourselves, it said: we are our own. The&#10;end of these discourses was that one night during which she had&#10;shown every sign of unusual excitement, Mrs. Sinico caught up his&#10;hand passionately and pressed it to her cheek.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Duffy was very much surprised. Her interpretation of his&#10;words disillusioned him. He did not visit her for a week, then he&#10;wrote to her asking her to meet him. As he did not wish their last&#10;interview to be troubled by the influence of their ruined&#10;confessional they meet in a little cakeshop near the Parkgate. It&#10;was cold autumn weather but in spite of the cold they wandered up&#10;and down the roads of the Park for nearly three hours. They agreed&#10;to break off their intercourse: every bond, he said, is a bond to&#10;sorrow. When they came out of the Park they walked in silence&#10;towards the tram; but here she began to tremble so violently that,&#10;fearing another collapse on her part, he bade her good-bye quickly&#10;and left her. A few days later he received a parcel containing his&#10;books and music.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Four years passed. Mr. Duffy returned to his even way of life.&#10;His room still bore witness of the orderliness of his mind. Some&#10;new pieces of music encumbered the music-stand in the lower room&#10;and on his shelves stood two volumes by Nietzsche: Thus Spake&#10;Zarathustra and The Gay Science. He wrote seldom in the sheaf of&#10;papers which lay in his desk. One of his sentences, written two&#10;months after his last interview with Mrs. Sinico, read: Love&#10;between man and man is impossible because there must not be sexual&#10;intercourse and friendship between man and woman is impossible&#10;because there must be sexual intercourse. He kept away from&#10;concerts lest he should meet her. His father died; the junior&#10;partner of the bank retired. And still every morning he went into&#10;the city by tram and every evening walked home from the city after&#10;having dined moderately in George&#39;s Street and read the evening&#10;paper for dessert.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;One evening as he was about to put a morsel of corned beef and&#10;cabbage into his mouth his hand stopped. His eyes fixed themselves&#10;on a paragraph in the evening paper which he had propped against&#10;the water-carafe. He replaced the morsel of food on his plate and&#10;read the paragraph attentively. Then he drank a glass of water,&#10;pushed his plate to one side, doubled the paper down before him&#10;between his elbows and read the paragraph over and over again. The&#10;cabbage began to deposit a cold white grease on his plate. The girl&#10;came over to him to ask was his dinner not properly cooked. He said&#10;it was very good and ate a few mouthfuls of it with difficulty.&#10;Then he paid his bill and went out.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He walked along quickly through the November twilight, his stout&#10;hazel stick striking the ground regularly, the fringe of the buff&#10;Mail peeping out of a side-pocket of his tight reefer overcoat. On&#10;the lonely road which leads from the Parkgate to Chapelizod he&#10;slackened his pace. His stick struck the ground less emphatically&#10;and his breath, issuing irregularly, almost with a sighing sound,&#10;condensed in the wintry air. When he reached his house he went up&#10;at once to his bedroom and, taking the paper from his pocket, read&#10;the paragraph again by the failing light of the window. He read it&#10;not aloud, but moving his lips as a priest does when he reads the&#10;prayers Secreto. This was the paragraph:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;DEATH OF A LADY AT SYDNEY PARADE&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A PAINFUL CASE&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Today at the City of Dublin Hospital the Deputy Coroner (in the&#10;absence of Mr. Leverett) held an inquest on the body of Mrs. Emily&#10;Sinico, aged forty-three years, who was killed at Sydney Parade&#10;Station yesterday evening. The evidence showed that the deceased&#10;lady, while attempting to cross the line, was knocked down by the&#10;engine of the ten o&#39;clock slow train from Kingstown, thereby&#10;sustaining injuries of the head and right side which led to her&#10;death.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;James Lennon, driver of the engine, stated that he had been in&#10;the employment of the railway company for fifteen years. On hearing&#10;the guard&#39;s whistle he set the train in motion and a second or two&#10;afterwards brought it to rest in response to loud cries. The train&#10;was going slowly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;P. Dunne, railway porter, stated that as the train was about to&#10;start he observed a woman attempting to cross the lines. He ran&#10;towards her and shouted, but, before he could reach her, she was&#10;caught by the buffer of the engine and fell to the ground.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A juror. &#34;You saw the lady fall?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Witness. &#34;Yes.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Police Sergeant Croly deposed that when he arrived he found the&#10;deceased lying on the platform apparently dead. He had the body&#10;taken to the waiting-room pending the arrival of the ambulance.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Constable 57 corroborated.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Dr. Halpin, assistant house surgeon of the City of Dublin&#10;Hospital, stated that the deceased had two lower ribs fractured and&#10;had sustained severe contusions of the right shoulder. The right&#10;side of the head had been injured in the fall. The injuries were&#10;not sufficient to have caused death in a normal person. Death, in&#10;his opinion, had been probably due to shock and sudden failure of&#10;the heart&#39;s action.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. H. B. Patterson Finlay, on behalf of the railway company,&#10;expressed his deep regret at the accident. The company had always&#10;taken every precaution to prevent people crossing the lines except&#10;by the bridges, both by placing notices in every station and by the&#10;use of patent spring gates at level crossings. The deceased had&#10;been in the habit of crossing the lines late at night from platform&#10;to platform and, in view of certain other circumstances of the&#10;case, he did not think the railway officials were to blame.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Captain Sinico, of Leoville, Sydney Parade, husband of the&#10;deceased, also gave evidence. He stated that the deceased was his&#10;wife. He was not in Dublin at the time of the accident as he had&#10;arrived only that morning from Rotterdam. They had been married for&#10;twenty-two years and had lived happily until about two years ago&#10;when his wife began to be rather intemperate in her habits.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Miss Mary Sinico said that of late her mother had been in the&#10;habit of going out at night to buy spirits. She, witness, had often&#10;tried to reason with her mother and had induced her to join a&#10;League. She was not at home until an hour after the accident. The&#10;jury returned a verdict in accordance with the medical evidence and&#10;exonerated Lennon from all blame.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Deputy Coroner said it was a most painful case, and&#10;expressed great sympathy with Captain Sinico and his daughter. He&#10;urged on the railway company to take strong measures to prevent the&#10;possibility of similar accidents in the future. No blame attached&#10;to anyone.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Duffy raised his eyes from the paper and gazed out of his&#10;window on the cheerless evening landscape. The river lay quiet&#10;beside the empty distillery and from time to time a light appeared&#10;in some house on the Lucan road. What an end! The whole narrative&#10;of her death revolted him and it revolted him to think that he had&#10;ever spoken to her of what he held sacred. The threadbare phrases,&#10;the inane expressions of sympathy, the cautious words of a reporter&#10;won over to conceal the details of a commonplace vulgar death&#10;attacked his stomach. Not merely had she degraded herself; she had&#10;degraded him. He saw the squalid tract of her vice, miserable and&#10;malodorous. His soul&#39;s companion! He thought of the hobbling&#10;wretches whom he had seen carrying cans and bottles to be filled by&#10;the barman. Just God, what an end! Evidently she had been unfit to&#10;live, without any strength of purpose, an easy prey to habits, one&#10;of the wrecks on which civilisation has been reared. But that she&#10;could have sunk so low! Was it possible he had deceived himself so&#10;utterly about her? He remembered her outburst of that night and&#10;interpreted it in a harsher sense than he had ever done. He had no&#10;difficulty now in approving of the course he had taken.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As the light failed and his memory began to wander he thought&#10;her hand touched his. The shock which had first attacked his&#10;stomach was now attacking his nerves. He put on his overcoat and&#10;hat quickly and went out. The cold air met him on the threshold; it&#10;crept into the sleeves of his coat. When he came to the&#10;public-house at Chapelizod Bridge he went in and ordered a hot&#10;punch.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The proprietor served him obsequiously but did not venture to&#10;talk. There were five or six workingmen in the shop discussing the&#10;value of a gentleman&#39;s estate in County Kildare They drank at&#10;intervals from their huge pint tumblers and smoked, spitting often&#10;on the floor and sometimes dragging the sawdust over their spits&#10;with their heavy boots. Mr. Duffy sat on his stool and gazed at&#10;them, without seeing or hearing them. After a while they went out&#10;and he called for another punch. He sat a long time over it. The&#10;shop was very quiet. The proprietor sprawled on the counter reading&#10;the Herald and yawning. Now and again a tram was heard swishing&#10;along the lonely road outside.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As he sat there, living over his life with her and evoking&#10;alternately the two images in which he now conceived her, he&#10;realised that she was dead, that she had ceased to exist, that she&#10;had become a memory. He began to feel ill at ease. He asked himself&#10;what else could he have done. He could not have carried on a comedy&#10;of deception with her; he could not have lived with her openly. He&#10;had done what seemed to him best. How was he to blame? Now that she&#10;was gone he understood how lonely her life must have been, sitting&#10;night after night alone in that room. His life would be lonely too&#10;until he, too, died, ceased to exist, became a memory&#8212;if anyone&#10;remembered him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was after nine o&#39;clock when he left the shop. The night was&#10;cold and gloomy. He entered the Park by the first gate and walked&#10;along under the gaunt trees. He walked through the bleak alleys&#10;where they had walked four years before. She seemed to be near him&#10;in the darkness. At moments he seemed to feel her voice touch his&#10;ear, her hand touch his. He stood still to listen. Why had he&#10;withheld life from her? Why had he sentenced her to death? He felt&#10;his moral nature falling to pieces.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When he gained the crest of the Magazine Hill he halted and&#10;looked along the river towards Dublin, the lights of which burned&#10;redly and hospitably in the cold night. He looked down the slope&#10;and, at the base, in the shadow of the wall of the Park, he saw&#10;some human figures lying. Those venal and furtive loves filled him&#10;with despair. He gnawed the rectitude of his life; he felt that he&#10;had been outcast from life&#39;s feast. One human being had seemed to&#10;love him and he had denied her life and happiness: he had sentenced&#10;her to ignominy, a death of shame. He knew that the prostrate&#10;creatures down by the wall were watching him and wished him gone.&#10;No one wanted him; he was outcast from life&#39;s feast. He turned his&#10;eyes to the grey gleaming river, winding along towards Dublin.&#10;Beyond the river he saw a goods train winding out of Kingsbridge&#10;Station, like a worm with a fiery head winding through the&#10;darkness, obstinately and laboriously. It passed slowly out of&#10;sight; but still he heard in his ears the laborious drone of the&#10;engine reiterating the syllables of her name.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He turned back the way he had come, the rhythm of the engine&#10;pounding in his ears. He began to doubt the reality of what memory&#10;told him. He halted under a tree and allowed the rhythm to die&#10;away. He could not feel her near him in the darkness nor her voice&#10;touch his ear. He waited for some minutes listening. He could hear&#10;nothing: the night was perfectly silent. He listened again:&#10;perfectly silent. He felt that he was alone.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 8, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/5', :deleted => 0)

When&#10;the dome was thinly covered his face lapsed into darkness but, as&#10;he set himself to fan the fire again, his crouching shadow ascended&#10;the opposite wall and his face slowly reemerged into light. It was&#10;an old man&#39;s face, very bony and hairy. The moist blue eyes blinked&#10;at the fire and the moist mouth fell open at times, munching once&#10;or twice mechanically when it closed. When the cinders had caught&#10;he laid the piece of cardboard against the wall, sighed and&#10;said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That&#39;s better now, Mr. O&#39;Connor.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. O&#39;Connor, a grey-haired young man, whose face was disfigured&#10;by many blotches and pimples, had just brought the tobacco for a&#10;cigarette into a shapely cylinder but when spoken to he undid his&#10;handiwork meditatively. Then he began to roll the tobacco again&#10;meditatively and after a moment&#39;s thought decided to lick the&#10;paper.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Did Mr. Tierney say when he&#39;d be back?&#34; he asked in a sky&#10;falsetto.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;He didn&#39;t say.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. O&#39;Connor put his cigarette into his mouth and began search&#10;his pockets. He took out a pack of thin pasteboard cards.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I&#39;ll get you a match,&#34; said the old man.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Never mind, this&#39;ll do,&#34; said Mr. O&#39;Connor.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He selected one of the cards and read what was printed on&#10;it:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;ROYAL EXCHANGE WARD&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Richard J. Tierney, P.L.G., respectfully solicits the favour&#10;of your vote and influence at the coming election in the Royal&#10;Exchange Ward.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. O&#39;Connor had been engaged by Tierney&#39;s agent to canvass one&#10;part of the ward but, as the weather was inclement and his boots&#10;let in the wet, he spent a great part of the day sitting by the&#10;fire in the Committee Room in Wicklow Street with Jack, the old&#10;caretaker. They had been sitting thus since e short day had grown&#10;dark. It was the sixth of October, dismal and cold out of&#10;doors.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. O&#39;Connor tore a strip off the card and, lighting it, lit his&#10;cigarette. As he did so the flame lit up a leaf of dark glossy ivy&#10;the lapel of his coat. The old man watched him attentively and&#10;then, taking up the piece of cardboard again, began to fan the fire&#10;slowly while his companion smoked.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ah, yes,&#34; he said, continuing, &#34;it&#39;s hard to know what way to&#10;bring up children. Now who&#39;d think he&#39;d turn out like that! I sent&#10;him to the Christian Brothers and I done what I could him, and&#10;there he goes boosing about. I tried to make him someway&#10;decent.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He replaced the cardboard wearily.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Only I&#39;m an old man now I&#39;d change his tune for him. I&#39;d take&#10;the stick to his back and beat him while I could stand over him&#8212;as&#10;I done many a time before. The mother, you know, she cocks him up&#10;with this and that&#8230; .&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That&#39;s what ruins children,&#34; said Mr. O&#39;Connor.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;To be sure it is,&#34; said the old man. &#34;And little thanks you get&#10;for it, only impudence. He takes th&#39;upper hand of me whenever he&#10;sees I&#39;ve a sup taken. What&#39;s the world coming to when sons speaks&#10;that way to their fathers?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What age is he?&#34; said Mr. O&#39;Connor.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Nineteen,&#34; said the old man.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why don&#39;t you put him to something?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Sure, amn&#39;t I never done at the drunken bowsy ever since he&#10;left school? &#39;I won&#39;t keep you,&#39; I says. &#39;You must get a job for&#10;yourself.&#39; But, sure, it&#39;s worse whenever he gets a job; he drinks&#10;it all.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. O&#39;Connor shook his head in sympathy, and the old man fell&#10;silent, gazing into the fire. Someone opened the door of the room&#10;and called out:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Hello! Is this a Freemason&#39;s meeting?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Who&#39;s that?&#34; said the old man.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What are you doing in the dark?&#34; asked a voice.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Is that you, Hynes?&#34; asked Mr. O&#39;Connor.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes. What are you doing in the dark?&#34; said Mr. Hynes. advancing&#10;into the light of the fire.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He was a tall, slender young man with a light brown moustache.&#10;Imminent little drops of rain hung at the brim of his hat and the&#10;collar of his jacket-coat was turned up.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well, Mat,&#34; he said to Mr. O&#39;Connor, &#34;how goes it?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. O&#39;Connor shook his head. The old man left the hearth and&#10;after stumbling about the room returned with two candlesticks which&#10;he thrust one after the other into the fire and carried to the&#10;table. A denuded room came into view and the fire lost all its&#10;cheerful colour. The walls of the room were bare except for a copy&#10;of an election address. In the middle of the room was a small table&#10;on which papers were heaped.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Hynes leaned against the mantelpiece and asked:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Has he paid you yet?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Not yet,&#34; said Mr. O&#39;Connor. &#34;I hope to God he&#39;ll not leave us&#10;in the lurch tonight.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Hynes laughed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O, he&#39;ll pay you. Never fear,&#34; he said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I hope he&#39;ll look smart about it if he means business,&#34; said&#10;Mr. O&#39;Connor.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What do you think, Jack?&#34; said Mr. Hynes satirically to the old&#10;man.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The old man returned to his seat by the fire, saying:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It isn&#39;t but he has it, anyway. Not like the other tinker.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What other tinker?&#34; said Mr. Hynes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Colgan,&#34; said the old man scornfully.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It is because Colgan&#39;s a working&#8212;man you say that? What&#39;s the&#10;difference between a good honest bricklayer and a publican&#8212;eh?&#10;Hasn&#39;t the working-man as good a right to be in the Corporation as&#10;anyone else&#8212;ay, and a better right than those shoneens that are&#10;always hat in hand before any fellow with a handle to his name?&#10;Isn&#39;t that so, Mat?&#34; said Mr. Hynes, addressing Mr. O&#39;Connor.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I think you&#39;re right,&#34; said Mr. O&#39;Connor.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;One man is a plain honest man with no hunker-sliding about him.&#10;He goes in to represent the labour classes. This fellow you&#39;re&#10;working for only wants to get some job or other.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;0f course, the working-classes should be represented,&#34; said the&#10;old man.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The working-man,&#34; said Mr. Hynes, &#34;gets all kicks and no&#10;halfpence. But it&#39;s labour produces everything. The workingman is&#10;not looking for fat jobs for his sons and nephews and cousins. The&#10;working-man is not going to drag the honour of Dublin in the mud to&#10;please a German monarch.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;How&#39;s that?&#34; said the old man.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Don&#39;t you know they want to present an address of welcome to&#10;Edward Rex if he comes here next year? What do we want kowtowing to&#10;a foreign king?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Our man won&#39;t vote for the address,&#34; said Mr. O&#39;Connor. &#34;He&#10;goes in on the Nationalist ticket.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Won&#39;t he?&#34; said Mr. Hynes. &#34;Wait till you see whether he will&#10;or not. I know him. Is it Tricky Dicky Tierney?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;By God! perhaps you&#39;re right, Joe,&#34; said Mr. O&#39;Connor. &#34;Anyway,&#10;I wish he&#39;d turn up with the spondulics.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The three men fell silent. The old man began to rake more&#10;cinders together. Mr. Hynes took off his hat, shook it and then&#10;turned down the collar of his coat, displaying, as he did so, an&#10;ivy leaf in the lapel.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;If this man was alive,&#34; he said, pointing to the leaf, &#34;we&#39;d&#10;have no talk of an address of welcome.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That&#39;s true,&#34; said Mr. O&#39;Connor.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Musha, God be with them times!&#34; said the old man. &#34;There was&#10;some life in it then.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The room was silent again. Then a bustling little man with a&#10;snuffling nose and very cold ears pushed in the door. He walked&#10;over quickly to the fire, rubbing his hands as if he intended to&#10;produce a spark from them.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No money, boys,&#34; he said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Sit down here, Mr. Henchy,&#34; said the old man, offering him his&#10;chair.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O, don&#39;t stir, Jack, don&#39;t stir,&#34; said Mr. Henchy&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He nodded curtly to Mr. Hynes and sat down on the chair which&#10;the old man vacated.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Did you serve Aungier Street?&#34; he asked Mr. O&#39;Connor.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes,&#34; said Mr. O&#39;Connor, beginning to search his pockets for&#10;memoranda.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Did you call on Grimes?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I did.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well? How does he stand?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;He wouldn&#39;t promise. He said: &#39;I won&#39;t tell anyone what way I&#39;m&#10;going to vote.&#39; But I think he&#39;ll be all right.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why so?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;He asked me who the nominators were; and I told him. I&#10;mentioned Father Burke&#39;s name. I think it&#39;ll be all right.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Henchy began to snuffle and to rub his hands over the fire&#10;at a terrific speed. Then he said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;For the love of God, Jack, bring us a bit of coal. There must&#10;be some left.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The old man went out of the room.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It&#39;s no go,&#34; said Mr. Henchy, shaking his head. &#34;I asked the&#10;little shoeboy, but he said: &#39;Oh, now, Mr. Henchy, when I see work&#10;going on properly I won&#39;t forget you, you may be sure.&#39; Mean little&#10;tinker! &#39;Usha, how could he be anything else?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What did I tell you, Mat?&#34; said Mr. Hynes. &#34;Tricky Dicky&#10;Tierney.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;0, he&#39;s as tricky as they make &#39;em,&#34; said Mr. Henchy. &#34;He&#10;hasn&#39;t got those little pigs&#39; eyes for nothing. Blast his soul!&#10;Couldn&#39;t he pay up like a man instead of: &#39;O, now, Mr. Henchy, I&#10;must speak to Mr. Fanning&#8230; . I&#39;ve spent a lot of money&#39;? Mean&#10;little schoolboy of hell! I suppose he forgets the time his little&#10;old father kept the hand-me-down shop in Mary&#39;s Lane.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But is that a fact?&#34; asked Mr. O&#39;Connor.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;God, yes,&#34; said Mr. Henchy. &#34;Did you never hear that? And the&#10;men used to go in on Sunday morning before the houses were open to&#10;buy a waistcoat or a trousers&#8212;moya! But Tricky Dicky&#39;s little old&#10;father always had a tricky little black bottle up in a corner. Do&#10;you mind now? That&#39;s that. That&#39;s where he first saw the&#10;light.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The old man returned with a few lumps of coal which he placed&#10;here and there on the fire.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Thats a nice how-do-you-do,&#34; said Mr. O&#39;Connor. &#34;How does he&#10;expect us to work for him if he won&#39;t stump up?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I can&#39;t help it,&#34; said Mr. Henchy. &#34;I expect to find the&#10;bailiffs in the hall when I go home.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Hynes laughed and, shoving himself away from the mantelpiece&#10;with the aid of his shoulders, made ready to leave.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It&#39;ll be all right when King Eddie comes,&#34; he said. &#34;Well boys,&#10;I&#39;m off for the present. See you later. &#39;Bye, &#39;bye.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He went out of the room slowly. Neither Mr. Henchy nor the old&#10;man said anything, but, just as the door was closing, Mr. O&#39;Connor,&#10;who had been staring moodily into the fire, called out&#10;suddenly:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;&#39;Bye, Joe.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Henchy waited a few moments and then nodded in the direction&#10;of the door.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Tell me,&#34; he said across the fire, &#34;what brings our friend in&#10;here? What does he want?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;&#39;Usha, poor Joe!&#34; said Mr. O&#39;Connor, throwing the end of his&#10;cigarette into the fire, &#34;he&#39;s hard up, like the rest of us.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Henchy snuffled vigorously and spat so copiously that he&#10;nearly put out the fire, which uttered a hissing protest.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;To tell you my private and candid opinion,&#34; he said, &#34;I think&#10;he&#39;s a man from the other camp. He&#39;s a spy of Colgan&#39;s, if you ask&#10;me. Just go round and try and find out how they&#39;re getting on. They&#10;won&#39;t suspect you. Do you twig?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ah, poor Joe is a decent skin,&#34; said Mr. O&#39;Connor.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;His father was a decent, respectable man,&#34; Mr. Henchy admitted.&#10;&#34;Poor old Larry Hynes! Many a good turn he did in his day! But I&#39;m&#10;greatly afraid our friend is not nineteen carat. Damn it, I can&#10;understand a fellow being hard up, but what I can&#39;t understand is a&#10;fellow sponging. Couldn&#39;t he have some spark of manhood about&#10;him?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;He doesn&#39;t get a warm welcome from me when he comes,&#34; said the&#10;old man. &#34;Let him work for his own side and not come spying around&#10;here.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I don&#39;t know,&#34; said Mr. O&#39;Connor dubiously, as he took out&#10;cigarette-papers and tobacco. &#34;I think Joe Hynes is a straight man.&#10;He&#39;s a clever chap, too, with the pen. Do you remember that thing&#10;he wrote&#8230; ?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Some of these hillsiders and fenians are a bit too clever if&#10;ask me,&#34; said Mr. Henchy. &#34;Do you know what my private and candid&#10;opinion is about some of those little jokers? I believe half of&#10;them are in the pay of the Castle.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;There&#39;s no knowing,&#34; said the old man.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O, but I know it for a fact,&#34; said Mr. Henchy. &#34;They&#39;re Castle&#10;hacks&#8230; . I don&#39;t say Hynes&#8230; . No, damn it, I think he&#39;s a stroke&#10;above that&#8230; . But there&#39;s a certain little nobleman with a cock-eye&#10;&#8212;you know the patriot I&#39;m alluding to?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. O&#39;Connor nodded.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;There&#39;s a lineal descendant of Major Sirr for you if you like!&#10;O, the heart&#39;s blood of a patriot! That&#39;s a fellow now that&#39;d sell&#10;his country for fourpence&#8212;ay&#8212;and go down on his bended knees and&#10;thank the Almighty Christ he had a country to sell.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There was a knock at the door.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Come in!&#34; said Mr. Henchy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A person resembling a poor clergyman or a poor actor appeared in&#10;the doorway. His black clothes were tightly buttoned on his short&#10;body and it was impossible to say whether he wore a clergyman&#39;s&#10;collar or a layman&#39;s, because the collar of his shabby frock-coat,&#10;the uncovered buttons of which reflected the candlelight, was&#10;turned up about his neck. He wore a round hat of hard black felt.&#10;His face, shining with raindrops, had the appearance of damp yellow&#10;cheese save where two rosy spots indicated the cheekbones. He&#10;opened his very long mouth suddenly to express disappointment and&#10;at the same time opened wide his very bright blue eyes to express&#10;pleasure and surprise.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O Father Keon!&#34; said Mr. Henchy, jumping up from his chair. &#34;Is&#10;that you? Come in!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O, no, no, no!&#34; said Father Keon quickly, pursing his lips as&#10;if he were addressing a child.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Won&#39;t you come in and sit down?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No, no, no!&#34; said Father Keon, speaking in a discreet,&#10;indulgent, velvety voice. &#34;Don&#39;t let me disturb you now! I&#39;m just&#10;looking for Mr. Fanning&#8230; .&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;He&#39;s round at the Black Eagle,&#34; said Mr. Henchy. &#34;But won&#39;t you&#10;come in and sit down a minute?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No, no, thank you. It was just a little business matter,&#34; said&#10;Father Keon. &#34;Thank you, indeed.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He retreated from the doorway and Mr. Henchy, seizing one of the&#10;candlesticks, went to the door to light him downstairs.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O, don&#39;t trouble, I beg!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No, but the stairs is so dark.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No, no, I can see&#8230; . Thank you, indeed.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Are you right now?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;All right, thanks&#8230; . Thanks.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Henchy returned with the candlestick and put it on the&#10;table. He sat down again at the fire. There was silence for a few&#10;moments.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Tell me, John,&#34; said Mr. O&#39;Connor, lighting his cigarette with&#10;another pasteboard card.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Hm? &#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What he is exactly?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ask me an easier one,&#34; said Mr. Henchy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Fanning and himself seem to me very thick. They&#39;re often in&#10;Kavanagh&#39;s together. Is he a priest at all?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Mmmyes, I believe so&#8230; . I think he&#39;s what you call black sheep.&#10;We haven&#39;t many of them, thank God! but we have a few&#8230; . He&#39;s an&#10;unfortunate man of some kind&#8230; .&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And how does he knock it out?&#34; asked Mr. O&#39;Connor.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That&#39;s another mystery.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Is he attached to any chapel or church or institution or&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No,&#34; said Mr. Henchy, &#34;I think he&#39;s travelling on his own&#10;account&#8230; . God forgive me,&#34; he added, &#34;I thought he was the dozen&#10;of stout.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Is there any chance of a drink itself?&#34; asked Mr. O&#39;Connor.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I&#39;m dry too,&#34; said the old man.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I asked that little shoeboy three times,&#34; said Mr. Henchy,&#10;&#34;would he send up a dozen of stout. I asked him again now, but he&#10;was leaning on the counter in his shirt-sleeves having a deep&#10;goster with Alderman Cowley.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why didn&#39;t you remind him?&#34; said Mr. O&#39;Connor.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well, I couldn&#39;t go over while he was talking to Alderman&#10;Cowley. I just waited till I caught his eye, and said: &#39;About that&#10;little matter I was speaking to you about&#8230; .&#39; &#39;That&#39;ll be all&#10;right, Mr. H.,&#39; he said. Yerra, sure the little hop-o&#39;- my-thumb&#10;has forgotten all about it.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;There&#39;s some deal on in that quarter,&#34; said Mr. O&#39;Connor&#10;thoughtfully. &#34;I saw the three of them hard at it yesterday at&#10;Suffolk Street corner.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I think I know the little game they&#39;re at,&#34; said Mr. Henchy.&#10;&#34;You must owe the City Fathers money nowadays if you want to be&#10;made Lord Mayor. Then they&#39;ll make you Lord Mayor. By God! I&#39;m&#10;thinking seriously of becoming a City Father myself. What do you&#10;think? Would I do for the job?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. O&#39;Connor laughed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;So far as owing money goes&#8230; .&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Driving out of the Mansion House,&#34; said Mr. Henchy, &#34;in all my&#10;vermin, with Jack here standing up behind me in a powdered wig&#10;&#8212;eh?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And make me your private secretary, John.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes. And I&#39;ll make Father Keon my private chaplain. We&#39;ll have&#10;a family party.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Faith, Mr. Henchy,&#34; said the old man, &#34;you&#39;d keep up better&#10;style than some of them. I was talking one day to old Keegan, the&#10;porter. &#39;And how do you like your new master, Pat?&#39; says I to him.&#10;&#39;You haven&#39;t much entertaining now,&#39; says I. &#39;Entertaining!&#39; says&#10;he. &#39;He&#39;d live on the smell of an oil- rag.&#39; And do you know what&#10;he told me? Now, I declare to God I didn&#39;t believe him.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What?&#34; said Mr. Henchy and Mr. O&#39;Connor.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;He told me: &#39;What do you think of a Lord Mayor of Dublin&#10;sending out for a pound of chops for his dinner? How&#39;s that for&#10;high living?&#39; says he. &#39;Wisha! wisha,&#39; says I. &#39;A pound of chops,&#39;&#10;says he, &#39;coming into the Mansion House.&#39; &#39;Wisha!&#39; says I, &#39;what&#10;kind of people is going at all now?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At this point there was a knock at the door, and a boy put in&#10;his head.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What is it?&#34; said the old man.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;From the Black Eagle,&#34; said the boy, walking in sideways and&#10;depositing a basket on the floor with a noise of shaken&#10;bottles.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The old man helped the boy to transfer the bottles from the&#10;basket to the table and counted the full tally. After the transfer&#10;the boy put his basket on his arm and asked:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Any bottles?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What bottles?&#34; said the old man.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Won&#39;t you let us drink them first?&#34; said Mr. Henchy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I was told to ask for the bottles.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Come back tomorrow,&#34; said the old man.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Here, boy!&#34; said Mr. Henchy, &#34;will you run over to O&#39;Farrell&#39;s&#10;and ask him to lend us a corkscrew&#8212;for Mr. Henchy, say. Tell him we&#10;won&#39;t keep it a minute. Leave the basket there.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The boy went out and Mr. Henchy began to rub his hands&#10;cheerfully, saying:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ah, well, he&#39;s not so bad after all. He&#39;s as good as his word,&#10;anyhow.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;There&#39;s no tumblers,&#34; said the old man.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O, don&#39;t let that trouble you, Jack,&#34; said Mr. Henchy. &#34;Many&#39;s&#10;the good man before now drank out of the bottle.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Anyway, it&#39;s better than nothing,&#34; said Mr. O&#39;Connor.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;He&#39;s not a bad sort,&#34; said Mr. Henchy, &#34;only Fanning has such a&#10;loan of him. He means well, you know, in his own tinpot way.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The boy came back with the corkscrew. The old man opened three&#10;bottles and was handing back the corkscrew when Mr. Henchy said to&#10;the boy:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Would you like a drink, boy?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;If you please, sir,&#34; said the boy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The old man opened another bottle grudgingly, and handed it to&#10;the boy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What age are you?&#34; he asked.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Seventeen,&#34; said the boy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As the old man said nothing further, the boy took the bottle.&#10;said: &#34;Here&#39;s my best respects, sir, to Mr. Henchy,&#34; drank the&#10;contents, put the bottle back on the table and wiped his mouth with&#10;his sleeve. Then he took up the corkscrew and went out of the door&#10;sideways, muttering some form of salutation.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That&#39;s the way it begins,&#34; said the old man.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The thin edge of the wedge,&#34; said Mr. Henchy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The old man distributed the three bottles which he had opened&#10;and the men drank from them simultaneously. After having drank each&#10;placed his bottle on the mantelpiece within hand&#39;s reach and drew&#10;in a long breath of satisfaction.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well, I did a good day&#39;s work today,&#34; said Mr. Henchy, after a&#10;pause.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That so, John?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes. I got him one or two sure things in Dawson Street, Crofton&#10;and myself. Between ourselves, you know, Crofton (he&#39;s a decent&#10;chap, of course), but he&#39;s not worth a damn as a canvasser. He&#10;hasn&#39;t a word to throw to a dog. He stands and looks at the people&#10;while I do the talking.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Here two men entered the room. One of them was a very fat man&#10;whose blue serge clothes seemed to be in danger of falling from his&#10;sloping figure. He had a big face which resembled a young ox&#39;s face&#10;in expression, staring blue eyes and a grizzled moustache. The&#10;other man, who was much younger and frailer, had a thin,&#10;clean-shaven face. He wore a very high double collar and a&#10;wide-brimmed bowler hat.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Hello, Crofton!&#34; said Mr. Henchy to the fat man. &#34;Talk of the&#10;devil&#8230; &#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Where did the boose come from?&#34; asked the young man. &#34;Did the&#10;cow calve?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O, of course, Lyons spots the drink first thing!&#34; said Mr.&#10;O&#39;Connor, laughing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Is that the way you chaps canvass,&#34; said Mr. Lyons, &#34;and&#10;Crofton and I out in the cold and rain looking for votes?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why, blast your soul,&#34; said Mr. Henchy, &#34;I&#39;d get more votes in&#10;five minutes than you two&#39;d get in a week.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Open two bottles of stout, Jack,&#34; said Mr. O&#39;Connor.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;How can I?&#34; said the old man, &#34;when there&#39;s no corkscrew? &#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Wait now, wait now!&#34; said Mr. Henchy, getting up quickly. &#34;Did&#10;you ever see this little trick?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He took two bottles from the table and, carrying them to the&#10;fire, put them on the hob. Then he sat dow-n again by the fire and&#10;took another drink from his bottle. Mr. Lyons sat on the edge of&#10;the table, pushed his hat towards the nape of his neck and began to&#10;swing his legs.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Which is my bottle?&#34; he asked.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;This, lad,&#34; said Mr. Henchy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Crofton sat down on a box and looked fixedly at the other&#10;bottle on the hob. He was silent for two reasons. The first reason,&#10;sufficient in itself, was that he had nothing to say; the second&#10;reason was that he considered his companions beneath him. He had&#10;been a canvasser for Wilkins, the Conservative, but when the&#10;Conservatives had withdrawn their man and, choosing the lesser of&#10;two evils, given their support to the Nationalist candidate, he had&#10;been engaged to work for Mr. Tiemey.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In a few minutes an apologetic &#34;Pok!&#34; was heard as the cork flew&#10;out of Mr. Lyons&#39; bottle. Mr. Lyons jumped off the table, went to&#10;the fire, took his bottle and carried it back to the table.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I was just telling them, Crofton,&#34; said Mr. Henchy, that we got&#10;a good few votes today.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Who did you get?&#34; asked Mr. Lyons.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well, I got Parkes for one, and I got Atkinson for two, and got&#10;Ward of Dawson Street. Fine old chap he is, too&#8212;regular old toff,&#10;old Conservative! &#39;But isn&#39;t your candidate a Nationalist?&#39; said&#10;he. &#39;He&#39;s a respectable man,&#39; said I. &#39;He&#39;s in favour of whatever&#10;will benefit this country. He&#39;s a big ratepayer,&#39; I said. &#39;He has&#10;extensive house property in the city and three places of business&#10;and isn&#39;t it to his own advantage to keep down the rates? He&#39;s a&#10;prominent and respected citizen,&#39; said I, &#39;and a Poor Law Guardian,&#10;and he doesn&#39;t belong to any party, good, bad, or indifferent.&#39;&#10;That&#39;s the way to talk to &#39;em.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And what about the address to the King?&#34; said Mr. Lyons, after&#10;drinking and smacking his lips.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Listen to me,&#34; said Mr. Henchy. &#34;What we want in thus country,&#10;as I said to old Ward, is capital. The King&#39;s coming here will mean&#10;an influx of money into this country. The citizens of Dublin will&#10;benefit by it. Look at all the factories down by the quays there,&#10;idle! Look at all the money there is in the country if we only&#10;worked the old industries, the mills, the ship-building yards and&#10;factories. It&#39;s capital we want.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But look here, John,&#34; said Mr. O&#39;Connor. &#34;Why should we welcome&#10;the King of England? Didn&#39;t Parnell himself&#8230; &#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Parnell,&#34; said Mr. Henchy, &#34;is dead. Now, here&#39;s the way I look&#10;at it. Here&#39;s this chap come to the throne after his old mother&#10;keeping him out of it till the man was grey. He&#39;s a man of the&#10;world, and he means well by us. He&#39;s a jolly fine decent fellow, if&#10;you ask me, and no damn nonsense about him. He just says to&#10;himself: &#39;The old one never went to see these wild Irish. By&#10;Christ, I&#39;ll go myself and see what they&#39;re like.&#39; And are we going&#10;to insult the man when he comes over here on a friendly visit? Eh?&#10;Isn&#39;t that right, Crofton?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Crofton nodded his head.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But after all now,&#34; said Mr. Lyons argumentatively, &#34;King&#10;Edward&#39;s life, you know, is not the very&#8230; &#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Let bygones be bygones,&#34; said Mr. Henchy. &#34;I admire the man&#10;personally. He&#39;s just an ordinary knockabout like you and me. He&#39;s&#10;fond of his glass of grog and he&#39;s a bit of a rake, perhaps, and&#10;he&#39;s a good sportsman. Damn it, can&#39;t we Irish play fair?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That&#39;s all very fine,&#34; said Mr. Lyons. &#34;But look at the case of&#10;Parnell now.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;In the name of God,&#34; said Mr. Henchy, &#34;where&#39;s the analogy&#10;between the two cases?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What I mean,&#34; said Mr. Lyons, &#34;is we have our ideals. Why, now,&#10;would we welcome a man like that? Do you think now after what he&#10;did Parnell was a fit man to lead us? And why, then, would we do it&#10;for Edward the Seventh?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;This is Parnell&#39;s anniversary,&#34; said Mr. O&#39;Connor, &#34;and don&#39;t&#10;let us stir up any bad blood. We all respect him now that he&#39;s dead&#10;and gone&#8212;even the Conservatives,&#34; he added, turning to Mr.&#10;Crofton.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Pok! The tardy cork flew out of Mr. Crofton&#39;s bottle. Mr.&#10;Crofton got up from his box and went to the fire. As he returned&#10;with his capture he said in a deep voice:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Our side of the house respects him, because he was a&#10;gentleman.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Right you are, Crofton!&#34; said Mr. Henchy fiercely. &#34;He was the&#10;only man that could keep that bag of cats in order. &#39;Down, ye dogs!&#10;Lie down, ye curs!&#39; That&#39;s the way he treated them. Come in, Joe!&#10;Come in!&#34; he called out, catching sight of Mr. Hynes in the&#10;doorway.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Hynes came in slowly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Open another bottle of stout, Jack,&#34; said Mr. Henchy. &#34;O, I&#10;forgot there&#39;s no corkscrew! Here, show me one here and I&#39;ll put it&#10;at the fire.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The old man handed him another bottle and he placed it on the&#10;hob.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Sit down, Joe,&#34; said Mr. O&#39;Connor, &#34;we&#39;re just talking about&#10;the Chief.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ay, ay!&#34; said Mr. Henchy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Hynes sat on the side of the table near Mr. Lyons but said&#10;nothing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;There&#39;s one of them, anyhow,&#34; said Mr. Henchy, &#34;that didn&#39;t&#10;renege him. By God, I&#39;ll say for you, Joe! No, by God, you stuck to&#10;him like a man!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;0, Joe,&#34; said Mr. O&#39;Connor suddenly. &#34;Give us that thing you&#10;wrote&#8212;do you remember? Have you got it on you?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;0, ay!&#34; said Mr. Henchy. &#34;Give us that. Did you ever hear that.&#10;Crofton? Listen to this now: splendid thing.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Go on,&#34; said Mr. O&#39;Connor. &#34;Fire away, Joe.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Hynes did not seem to remember at once the piece to which&#10;they were alluding, but, after reflecting a while, he said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O, that thing is it&#8230; . Sure, that&#39;s old now.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Out with it, man!&#34; said Mr. O&#39;Connor.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;&#39;Sh, &#39;sh,&#34; said Mr. Henchy. &#34;Now, Joe!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Hynes hesitated a little longer. Then amid the silence he&#10;took off his hat, laid it on the table and stood up. He seemed to&#10;be rehearsing the piece in his mind. After a rather long pause he&#10;announced:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;THE DEATH OF PARNELL&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;6th October, 1891&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He cleared his throat once or twice and then began to&#10;recite:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He is dead. Our Uncrowned King is dead.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;O, Erin, mourn with grief and woe&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For he lies dead whom the fell gang&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Of modern hypocrites laid low.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He lies slain by the coward hounds&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He raised to glory from the mire;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And Erin&#39;s hopes and Erin&#39;s dreams&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Perish upon her monarch&#39;s pyre.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In palace, cabin or in cot&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Irish heart where&#39;er it be&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Is bowed with woe&#8212;for he is gone&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Who would have wrought her destiny.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He would have had his Erin famed,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The green flag gloriously unfurled,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Her statesmen, bards and warriors raised&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Before the nations of the World.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He dreamed (alas, &#39;twas but a dream!)&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Of Liberty: but as he strove&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;To clutch that idol, treachery&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Sundered him from the thing he loved.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Shame on the coward, caitiff hands&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;That smote their Lord or with a kiss&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Betrayed him to the rabble-rout&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Of fawning priests&#8212;no friends of his.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;May everlasting shame consume&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The memory of those who tried&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;To befoul and smear the exalted name&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Of one who spurned them in his pride.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He fell as fall the mighty ones,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Nobly undaunted to the last,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And death has now united him&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With Erin&#39;s heroes of the past.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;No sound of strife disturb his sleep!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Calmly he rests: no human pain&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Or high ambition spurs him now&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The peaks of glory to attain.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;They had their way: they laid him low.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But Erin, list, his spirit may&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Rise, like the Phoenix from the flames,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When breaks the dawning of the day,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The day that brings us Freedom&#39;s reign.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And on that day may Erin well&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Pledge in the cup she lifts to Joy&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;One grief&#8212;the memory of Parnell.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Hynes sat down again on the table. When he had finished his&#10;recitation there was a silence and then a burst of clapping: even&#10;Mr. Lyons clapped. The applause continued for a little time. When&#10;it had ceased all the auditors drank from their bottles in&#10;silence.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Pok! The cork flew out of Mr. Hynes&#39; bottle, but Mr. Hynes&#10;remained sitting flushed and bare-headed on the table. He did not&#10;seem to have heard the invitation.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Good man, Joe!&#34; said Mr. O&#39;Connor, taking out his cigarette&#10;papers and pouch the better to hide his emotion.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What do you think of that, Crofton?&#34; cried Mr. Henchy. &#34;Isn&#39;t&#10;that fine? What?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Crofton said that it was a very fine piece of writing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 8, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/5', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode(' A&#10;Mother'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;MR HOLOHAN, assistant secretary of the Eire Abu Society, had&#10;been walking up and down Dublin for nearly a month, with his hands&#10;and pockets full of dirty pieces of paper, arranging about the&#10;series of concerts. He had a game leg and for this his friends&#10;called him Hoppy Holohan. He walked up and down constantly, stood&#10;by the hour at street corners arguing the point and made notes; but&#10;in the end it was Mrs. Kearney who arranged everything.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Miss Devlin had become Mrs. Kearney out of spite. She had been&#10;educated in a high-class convent, where she had learned French and&#10;music. As she was naturally pale and unbending in manner she made&#10;few friends at school. When she came to the age of marriage she was&#10;sent out to many houses, where her playing and ivory manners were&#10;much admired. She sat amid the chilly circle of her&#10;accomplishments, waiting for some suitor to brave it and offer her&#10;a brilliant life. But the young men whom she met were ordinary and&#10;she gave them no encouragement, trying to console her romantic&#10;desires by eating a great deal of Turkish Delight in secret.&#10;However, when she drew near the limit and her friends began to&#10;loosen their tongues about her, she silenced them by marrying Mr.&#10;Kearney, who was a bootmaker on Ormond Quay.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He was much older than she. His conversation, which was serious,&#10;took place at intervals in his great brown beard. After the first&#10;year of married life, Mrs. Kearney perceived that such a man would&#10;wear better than a romantic person, but she never put her own&#10;romantic ideas away. He was sober, thrifty and pious; he went to&#10;the altar every first Friday, sometimes with her, oftener by&#10;himself. But she never weakened in her religion and was a good wife&#10;to him. At some party in a strange house when she lifted her&#10;eyebrow ever so slightly he stood up to take his leave and, when&#10;his cough troubled him, she put the eider-down quilt over his feet&#10;and made a strong rum punch. For his part, he was a model father.&#10;By paying a small sum every week into a society, he ensured for&#10;both his daughters a dowry of one hundred pounds each when they&#10;came to the age of twenty-four. He sent the older daughter,&#10;Kathleen, to a good convent, where she learned French and music,&#10;and afterward paid her fees at the Academy. Every year in the month&#10;of July Mrs. Kearney found occasion to say to some friend:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My good man is packing us off to Skerries for a few weeks.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;If it was not Skerries it was Howth or Greystones.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When the Irish Revival began to be appreciable Mrs. Kearney&#10;determined to take advantage of her daughter&#39;s name and brought an&#10;Irish teacher to the house. Kathleen and her sister sent Irish&#10;picture postcards to their friends and these friends sent back&#10;other Irish picture postcards. On special Sundays, when Mr. Kearney&#10;went with his family to the pro-cathedral, a little crowd of people&#10;would assemble after mass at the corner of Cathedral Street. They&#10;were all friends of the Kearneys&#8212;musical friends or Nationalist&#10;friends; and, when they had played every little counter of gossip,&#10;they shook hands with one another all together, laughing at the&#10;crossing of so man hands, and said good-bye to one another in&#10;Irish. Soon the name of Miss Kathleen Kearney began to be heard&#10;often on people&#39;s lips. People said that she was very clever at&#10;music and a very nice girl and, moreover, that she was a believer&#10;in the language movement. Mrs. Kearney was well content at this.&#10;Therefore she was not surprised when one day Mr. Holohan came to&#10;her and proposed that her daughter should be the accompanist at a&#10;series of four grand concerts which his Society was going to give&#10;in the Antient Concert Rooms. She brought him into the&#10;drawing-room, made him sit down and brought out the decanter and&#10;the silver biscuit-barrel. She entered heart and soul into the&#10;details of the enterprise, advised and dissuaded: and finally a&#10;contract was drawn up by which Kathleen was to receive eight&#10;guineas for her services as accompanist at the four grand&#10;concerts.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As Mr. Holohan was a novice in such delicate matters as the&#10;wording of bills and the disposing of items for a programme, Mrs.&#10;Kearney helped him. She had tact. She knew what artistes should go&#10;into capitals and what artistes should go into small type. She knew&#10;that the first tenor would not like to come on after Mr. Meade&#39;s&#10;comic turn. To keep the audience continually diverted she slipped&#10;the doubtful items in between the old favourites. Mr. Holohan&#10;called to see her every day to have her advice on some point. She&#10;was invariably friendly and advising&#8212;homely, in fact. She pushed&#10;the decanter towards him, saying:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Now, help yourself, Mr. Holohan!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And while he was helping himself she said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Don&#39;t be afraid! Don t be afraid of it! &#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Everything went on smoothly. Mrs. Kearney bought some lovely&#10;blush-pink charmeuse in Brown Thomas&#39;s to let into the front of&#10;Kathleen&#39;s dress. It cost a pretty penny; but there are occasions&#10;when a little expense is justifiable. She took a dozen of&#10;two-shilling tickets for the final concert and sent them to those&#10;friends who could not be trusted to come otherwise. She forgot&#10;nothing, and, thanks to her, everything that was to be done was&#10;done.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The concerts were to be on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and&#10;Saturday. When Mrs. Kearney arrived with her daughter at the&#10;Antient Concert Rooms on Wednesday night she did not like the look&#10;of things. A few young men, wearing bright blue badges in their&#10;coats, stood idle in the vestibule; none of them wore evening&#10;dress. She passed by with her daughter and a quick glance through&#10;the open door of the hall showed her the cause of the stewards&#39;&#10;idleness. At first she wondered had she mistaken the hour. No, it&#10;was twenty minutes to eight.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In the dressing-room behind the stage she was introduced to the&#10;secretary of the Society, Mr. Fitzpatrick. She smiled and shook his&#10;hand. He was a little man, with a white, vacant face. She noticed&#10;that he wore his soft brown hat carelessly on the side of his head&#10;and that his accent was flat. He held a programme in his hand, and,&#10;while he was talking to her, he chewed one end of it into a moist&#10;pulp. He seemed to bear disappointments lightly. Mr. Holohan came&#10;into the dressingroom every few minutes with reports from the box-&#10;office. The artistes talked among themselves nervously, glanced&#10;from time to time at the mirror and rolled and unrolled their&#10;music. When it was nearly half-past eight, the few people in the&#10;hall began to express their desire to be entertained. Mr.&#10;Fitzpatrick came in, smiled vacantly at the room, and said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Well now, ladies and gentlemen. I suppose we&#39;d better open the&#10;ball.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mrs. Kearney rewarded his very flat final syllable with a quick&#10;stare of contempt, and then said to her daughter encouragingly:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Are you ready, dear?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When she had an opportunity, she called Mr. Holohan aside and&#10;asked him to tell her what it meant. Mr. Holohan did not know what&#10;it meant. He said that the committee had made a mistake in&#10;arranging for four concerts: four was too many.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And the artistes!&#34; said Mrs. Kearney. &#34;Of course they are doing&#10;their best, but really they are not good.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Holohan admitted that the artistes were no good but the&#10;committee, he said, had decided to let the first three concerts go&#10;as they pleased and reserve all the talent for Saturday night. Mrs.&#10;Kearney said nothing, but, as the mediocre items followed one&#10;another on the platform and the few people in the hall grew fewer&#10;and fewer, she began to regret that she had put herself to any&#10;expense for such a concert. There was something she didn&#39;t like in&#10;the look of things and Mr. Fitzpatrick&#39;s vacant smile irritated her&#10;very much. However, she said nothing and waited to see how it would&#10;end. The concert expired shortly before ten, and everyone went home&#10;quickly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The concert on Thursday night was better attended, but Mrs.&#10;Kearney saw at once that the house was filled with paper. The&#10;audience behaved indecorously, as if the concert were an informal&#10;dress rehearsal. Mr. Fitzpatrick seemed to enjoy himself; he was&#10;quite unconscious that Mrs. Kearney was taking angry note of his&#10;conduct. He stood at the edge of the screen, from time to time&#10;jutting out his head and exchanging a laugh with two friends in the&#10;corner of the balcony. In the course of the evening, Mrs. Kearney&#10;learned that the Friday concert was to be abandoned and that the&#10;committee was going to move heaven and earth to secure a bumper&#10;house on Saturday night. When she heard this, she sought out Mr.&#10;Holohan. She buttonholed him as he was limping out quickly with a&#10;glass of lemonade for a young lady and asked him was it true. Yes.&#10;it was true.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But, of course, that doesn&#39;t alter the contract,&#34; she said.&#10;&#34;The contract was for four concerts.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Holohan seemed to be in a hurry; he advised her to speak to&#10;Mr. Fitzpatrick. Mrs. Kearney was now beginning to be alarmed. She&#10;called Mr. Fitzpatrick away from his screen and told him that her&#10;daughter had signed for four concerts and that, of course,&#10;according to the terms of the contract, she should receive the sum&#10;originally stipulated for, whether the society gave the four&#10;concerts or not. Mr. Fitzpatrick, who did not catch the point at&#10;issue very quickly, seemed unable to resolve the difficulty and&#10;said that he would bring the matter before the committee. Mrs.&#10;Kearney&#39;s anger began to flutter in her cheek and she had all she&#10;could do to keep from asking:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And who is the Cometty pray?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But she knew that it would not be ladylike to do that: so she&#10;was silent.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Little boys were sent out into the principal streets of Dublin&#10;early on Friday morning with bundles of handbills. Special puffs&#10;appeared in all the evening papers, reminding the music loving&#10;public of the treat which was in store for it on the following&#10;evening. Mrs. Kearney was somewhat reassured, but be thought well&#10;to tell her husband part of her suspicions. He listened carefully&#10;and said that perhaps it would be better if he went with her on&#10;Saturday night. She agreed. She respected her husband in the same&#10;way as she respected the General Post Office, as something large,&#10;secure and fixed; and though she knew the small number of his&#10;talents she appreciated his abstract value as a male. She was glad&#10;that he had suggested coming with her. She thought her plans&#10;over.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The night of the grand concert came. Mrs. Kearney, with her&#10;husband and daughter, arrived at the Antient Concert Rooms&#10;three-quarters of an hour before the time at which the concert was&#10;to begin. By ill luck it was a rainy evening. Mrs. Kearney placed&#10;her daughter&#39;s clothes and music in charge of her husband and went&#10;all over the building looking for Mr. Holohan or Mr. Fitzpatrick.&#10;She could find neither. She asked the stewards was any member of&#10;the committee in the hall and, after a great deal of trouble, a&#10;steward brought out a little woman named Miss Beirne to whom Mrs.&#10;Kearney explained that she wanted to see one of the secretaries.&#10;Miss Beirne expected them any minute and asked could she do&#10;anything. Mrs. Kearney looked searchingly at the oldish face which&#10;was screwed into an expression of trustfulness and enthusiasm and&#10;answered:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No, thank you!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The little woman hoped they would have a good house. She looked&#10;out at the rain until the melancholy of the wet street effaced all&#10;the trustfulness and enthusiasm from her twisted features. Then she&#10;gave a little sigh and said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ah, well! We did our best, the dear knows.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mrs. Kearney had to go back to the dressing-room.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The artistes were arriving. The bass and the second tenor had&#10;already come. The bass, Mr. Duggan, was a slender young man with a&#10;scattered black moustache. He was the son of a hall porter in an&#10;office in the city and, as a boy, he had sung prolonged bass notes&#10;in the resounding hall. From this humble state he had raised&#10;himself until he had become a first-rate artiste. He had appeared&#10;in grand opera. One night, when an operatic artiste had fallen ill,&#10;he had undertaken the part of the king in the opera of Maritana at&#10;the Queen&#39;s Theatre. He sang his music with great feeling and&#10;volume and was warmly welcomed by the gallery; but, unfortunately,&#10;he marred the good impression by wiping his nose in his gloved hand&#10;once or twice out of thoughtlessness. He was unassuming and spoke&#10;little. He said yous so softly that it passed unnoticed and he&#10;never drank anything stronger than milk for his voice&#39;s sake. Mr.&#10;Bell, the second tenor, was a fair-haired little man who competed&#10;every year for prizes at the Feis Ceoil. On his fourth trial he had&#10;been awarded a bronze medal. He was extremely nervous and extremely&#10;jealous of other tenors and he covered his nervous jealousy with an&#10;ebullient friendliness. It was his humour to have people know what&#10;an ordeal a concert was to him. Therefore when he saw Mr. Duggan he&#10;went over to him and asked:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Are you in it too? &#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes,&#34; said Mr. Duggan.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Bell laughed at his fellow-sufferer, held out his hand and&#10;said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Shake!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mrs. Kearney passed by these two young men and went to the edge&#10;of the screen to view the house. The seats were being filled up&#10;rapidly and a pleasant noise circulated in the auditorium. She came&#10;back and spoke to her husband privately. Their conversation was&#10;evidently about Kathleen for they both glanced at her often as she&#10;stood chatting to one of her Nationalist friends, Miss Healy, the&#10;contralto. An unknown solitary woman with a pale face walked&#10;through the room. The women followed with keen eyes the faded blue&#10;dress which was stretched upon a meagre body. Someone said that she&#10;was Madam Glynn, the soprano.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I wonder where did they dig her up,&#34; said Kathleen to Miss&#10;Healy. &#34;I&#39;m sure I never heard of her.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Miss Healy had to smile. Mr. Holohan limped into the&#10;dressing-room at that moment and the two young ladies asked him who&#10;was the unknown woman. Mr. Holohan said that she was Madam Glynn&#10;from London. Madam Glynn took her stand in a corner of the room,&#10;holding a roll of music stiffly before her and from time to time&#10;changing the direction of her startled gaze. The shadow took her&#10;faded dress into shelter but fell revengefully into the little cup&#10;behind her collar-bone. The noise of the hall became more audible.&#10;The first tenor and the baritone arrived together. They were both&#10;well dressed, stout and complacent and they brought a breath of&#10;opulence among the company.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mrs. Kearney brought her daughter over to them, and talked to&#10;them amiably. She wanted to be on good terms with them but, while&#10;she strove to be polite, her eyes followed Mr. Holohan in his&#10;limping and devious courses. As soon as she could she excused&#10;herself and went out after him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Mr. Holohan, I want to speak to you for a moment,&#34; she&#10;said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;They went down to a discreet part of the corridor. Mrs Kearney&#10;asked him when was her daughter going to be paid. Mr. Holohan said&#10;that Mr. Fitzpatrick had charge of that. Mrs. Kearney said that she&#10;didn&#39;t know anything about Mr. Fitzpatrick. Her daughter had signed&#10;a contract for eight guineas and she would have to be paid. Mr.&#10;Holohan said that it wasn&#39;t his business.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why isn&#39;t it your business?&#34; asked Mrs. Kearney. &#34;Didn&#39;t you&#10;yourself bring her the contract? Anyway, if it&#39;s not your business&#10;it&#39;s my business and I mean to see to it.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You&#39;d better speak to Mr. Fitzpatrick,&#34; said Mr. Holohan&#10;distantly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I don&#39;t know anything about Mr. Fitzpatrick,&#34; repeated Mrs.&#10;Kearney. &#34;I have my contract, and I intend to see that it is&#10;carried out.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When she came back to the dressing-room her cheeks were slightly&#10;suffused. The room was lively. Two men in outdoor dress had taken&#10;possession of the fireplace and were chatting familiarly with Miss&#10;Healy and the baritone. They were the Freeman man and Mr. O&#39;Madden&#10;Burke. The Freeman man had come in to say that he could not wait&#10;for the concert as he had to report the lecture which an American&#10;priest was giving in the Mansion House. He said they were to leave&#10;the report for him at the Freeman office and he would see that it&#10;went in. He was a grey-haired man, with a plausible voice and&#10;careful manners. He held an extinguished cigar in his hand and the&#10;aroma of cigar smoke floated near him. He had not intended to stay&#10;a moment because concerts and artistes bored him considerably but&#10;he remained leaning against the mantelpiece. Miss Healy stood in&#10;front of him, talking and laughing. He was old enough to suspect&#10;one reason for her politeness but young enough in spirit to turn&#10;the moment to account. The warmth, fragrance and colour of her body&#10;appealed to his senses. He was pleasantly conscious that the bosom&#10;which he saw rise and fall slowly beneath him rose and fell at that&#10;moment for him, that the laughter and fragrance and wilful glances&#10;were his tribute. When he could stay no longer he took leave of her&#10;regretfully.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O&#39;Madden Burke will write the notice,&#34; he explained to Mr.&#10;Holohan, &#34;and I&#39;ll see it in.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Thank you very much, Mr. Hendrick,&#34; said Mr. Holohan. you&#39;ll&#10;see it in, I know. Now, won&#39;t you have a little something before&#10;you go?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I don&#39;t mind,&#34; said Mr. Hendrick.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The two men went along some tortuous passages and up a dark&#10;staircase and came to a secluded room where one of the stewards was&#10;uncorking bottles for a few gentlemen. One of these gentlemen was&#10;Mr. O&#39;Madden Burke, who had found out the room by instinct. He was&#10;a suave, elderly man who balanced his imposing body, when at rest,&#10;upon a large silk umbrella. His magniloquent western name was the&#10;moral umbrella upon which he balanced the fine problem of his&#10;finances. He was widely respected.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;While Mr. Holohan was entertaining the Freeman man Mrs. Kearney&#10;was speaking so animatedly to her husband that he had to ask her to&#10;lower her voice. The conversation of the others in the&#10;dressing-room had become strained. Mr. Bell, the first item, stood&#10;ready with his music but the accompanist made no sign. Evidently&#10;something was wrong. Mr. Kearney looked straight before him,&#10;stroking his beard, while Mrs. Kearney spoke into Kathleen&#39;s ear&#10;with subdued emphasis. From the hall came sounds of encouragement,&#10;clapping and stamping of feet. The first tenor and the baritone and&#10;Miss Healy stood together, waiting tranquilly, but Mr. Bell&#39;s&#10;nerves were greatly agitated because he was afraid the audience&#10;would think that he had come late.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Holohan and Mr. O&#39;Madden Burke came into the room In a&#10;moment Mr. Holohan perceived the hush. He went over to Mrs. Kearney&#10;and spoke with her earnestly. While they were speaking the noise in&#10;the hall grew louder. Mr. Holohan became very red and excited. He&#10;spoke volubly, but Mrs. Kearney said curtly at intervals:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;She won&#39;t go on. She must get her eight guineas.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Holohan pointed desperately towards the hall where the&#10;audience was clapping and stamping. He appealed to Mr Kearney and&#10;to Kathleen. But Mr. Kearney continued to stroke his beard and&#10;Kathleen looked down, moving the point of her new shoe: it was not&#10;her fault. Mrs. Kearney repeated:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;She won&#39;t go on without her money.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;After a swift struggle of tongues Mr. Holohan hobbled out in&#10;haste. The room was silent. When the strain of the silence had&#10;become somewhat painful Miss Healy said to the baritone:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Have you seen Mrs. Pat Campbell this week?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The baritone had not seen her but he had been told that she was&#10;very fine. The conversation went no further. The first tenor bent&#10;his head and began to count the links of the gold chain which was&#10;extended across his waist, smiling and humming random notes to&#10;observe the effect on the frontal sinus. From time to time everyone&#10;glanced at Mrs. Kearney.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The noise in the auditorium had risen to a clamour when Mr.&#10;Fitzpatrick burst into the room, followed by Mr. Holohan who was&#10;panting. The clapping and stamping in the hall were punctuated by&#10;whistling. Mr. Fitzpatrick held a few banknotes in his hand. He&#10;counted out four into Mrs. Kearney&#39;s hand and said she would get&#10;the other half at the interval. Mrs. Kearney said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;This is four shillings short.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But Kathleen gathered in her skirt and said: &#34;Now. Mr. Bell,&#34; to&#10;the first item, who was shaking like an aspen. The singer and the&#10;accompanist went out together. The noise in hall died away. There&#10;was a pause of a few seconds: and then the piano was heard.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The first part of the concert was very successful except for&#10;Madam Glynn&#39;s item. The poor lady sang Killarney in a bodiless&#10;gasping voice, with all the old-fashioned mannerisms of intonation&#10;and pronunciation which she believed lent elegance to her singing.&#10;She looked as if she had been resurrected from an old&#10;stage-wardrobe and the cheaper parts of the hall made fun of her&#10;high wailing notes. The first tenor and the contralto, however,&#10;brought down the house. Kathleen played a selection of Irish airs&#10;which was generously applauded. The first part closed with a&#10;stirring patriotic recitation delivered by a young lady who&#10;arranged amateur theatricals. It was deservedly applauded; and,&#10;when it was ended, the men went out for the interval, content.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;All this time the dressing-room was a hive of excitement. In one&#10;corner were Mr. Holohan, Mr. Fitzpatrick, Miss Beirne, two of the&#10;stewards, the baritone, the bass, and Mr. O&#39;Madden Burke. Mr.&#10;O&#39;Madden Burke said it was the most scandalous exhibition he had&#10;ever witnessed. Miss Kathleen Kearney&#39;s musical career was ended in&#10;Dublin after that, he said. The baritone was asked what did he&#10;think of Mrs. Kearney&#39;s conduct. He did not like to say anything.&#10;He had been paid his money and wished to be at peace with men.&#10;However, he said that Mrs. Kearney might have taken the artistes&#10;into consideration. The stewards and the secretaries debated hotly&#10;as to what should be done when the interval came.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I agree with Miss Beirne,&#34; said Mr. O&#39;Madden Burke. &#34;Pay her&#10;nothing.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In another corner of the room were Mrs. Kearney and he: husband,&#10;Mr. Bell, Miss Healy and the young lady who had to recite the&#10;patriotic piece. Mrs. Kearney said that the Committee had treated&#10;her scandalously. She had spared neither trouble nor expense and&#10;this was how she was repaid.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;They thought they had only a girl to deal with and that&#10;therefore, they could ride roughshod over her. But she would show&#10;them their mistake. They wouldn&#39;t have dared to have treated her&#10;like that if she had been a man. But she would see that her&#10;daughter got her rights: she wouldn&#39;t be fooled. If they didn&#39;t pay&#10;her to the last farthing she would make Dublin ring. Of course she&#10;was sorry for the sake of the artistes. But what else could she do?&#10;She appealed to the second tenor who said he thought she had not&#10;been well treated. Then she appealed to Miss Healy. Miss Healy&#10;wanted to join the other group but she did not like to do so&#10;because she was a great friend of Kathleen&#39;s and the Kearneys had&#10;often invited her to their house.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As soon as the first part was ended Mr. Fitzpatrick and Mr.&#10;Holohan went over to Mrs. Kearney and told her that the other four&#10;guineas would be paid after the committee meeting on the following&#10;Tuesday and that, in case her daughter did not play for the second&#10;part, the committee would consider the contract broken and would&#10;pay nothing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I haven&#39;t seen any committee,&#34; said Mrs. Kearney angrily. &#34;My&#10;daughter has her contract. She will get four pounds eight into her&#10;hand or a foot she won&#39;t put on that platform.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I&#39;m surprised at you, Mrs. Kearney,&#34; said Mr. Holohan. &#34;I never&#10;thought you would treat us this way.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And what way did you treat me?&#34; asked Mrs. Kearney.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Her face was inundated with an angry colour and she looked as if&#10;she would attack someone with her hands.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I&#39;m asking for my rights.&#34; she said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;You might have some sense of decency,&#34; said Mr. Holohan.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Might I, indeed?&#8230; And when I ask when my daughter is going to&#10;be paid I can&#39;t get a civil answer.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She tossed her head and assumed a haughty voice:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You must speak to the secretary. It&#39;s not my business. I&#39;m a&#10;great fellow fol-the-diddle-I-do.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I thought you were a lady,&#34; said Mr. Holohan, walking away from&#10;her abruptly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;After that Mrs. Kearney&#39;s conduct was condemned on all hands:&#10;everyone approved of what the committee had done. She stood at the&#10;door, haggard with rage, arguing with her husband and daughter,&#10;gesticulating with them. She waited until it was time for the&#10;second part to begin in the hope that the secretaries would&#10;approach her. But Miss Healy had kindly consented to play one or&#10;two accompaniments. Mrs. Kearney had to stand aside to allow the&#10;baritone and his accompanist to pass up to the platform. She stood&#10;still for an instant like an angry stone image and, when the first&#10;notes of the song struck her ear, she caught up her daughter&#39;s&#10;cloak and said to her husband:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Get a cab!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He went out at once. Mrs. Kearney wrapped the cloak round her&#10;daughter and followed him. As she passed through the doorway she&#10;stopped and glared into Mr. Holohan&#39;s face.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I&#39;m not done with you yet,&#34; she said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But I&#39;m done with you,&#34; said Mr. Holohan.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Kathleen followed her mother meekly. Mr. Holohan began to pace&#10;up and down the room, in order to cool himself for he his skin on&#10;fire.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That&#39;s a nice lady!&#34; he said. &#34;O, she&#39;s a nice lady!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;You did the proper thing, Holohan,&#34; said Mr. O&#39;Madden Burke,&#10;poised upon his umbrella in approval.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 8, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/5', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;Grace'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;TWO GENTLEMEN who were in the lavatory at the time tried to lift&#10;him up: but he was quite helpless. He lay curled up at the foot of&#10;the stairs down which he had fallen. They succeeded in turning him&#10;over. His hat had rolled a few yards away and his clothes were&#10;smeared with the filth and ooze of the floor on which he had lain,&#10;face downwards. His eyes were closed and he breathed with a&#10;grunting noise. A thin stream of blood trickled from the corner of&#10;his mouth.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;These two gentlemen and one of the curates carried him up the&#10;stairs and laid him down again on the floor of the bar. In two&#10;minutes he was surrounded by a ring of men. The manager of the bar&#10;asked everyone who he was and who was with him. No one knew who he&#10;was but one of the curates said he had served the gentleman with a&#10;small rum.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Was he by himself?&#34; asked the manager.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No, sir. There was two gentlemen with him.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And where are they?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;No one knew; a voice said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Give him air. He&#39;s fainted.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The ring of onlookers distended and closed again elastically. A&#10;dark medal of blood had formed itself near the man&#39;s head on the&#10;tessellated floor. The manager, alarmed by the grey pallor of the&#10;man&#39;s face, sent for a policeman.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;His collar was unfastened and his necktie undone. He opened eyes&#10;for an instant, sighed and closed them again. One of gentlemen who&#10;had carried him upstairs held a dinged silk hat in his hand. The&#10;manager asked repeatedly did no one know who the injured man was or&#10;where had his friends gone. The door of the bar opened and an&#10;immense constable entered. A crowd which had followed him down the&#10;laneway collected outside the door, struggling to look in through&#10;the glass panels.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The manager at once began to narrate what he knew. The costable,&#10;a young man with thick immobile features, listened. He moved his&#10;head slowly to right and left and from the manager to the person on&#10;the floor, as if he feared to be the victim some delusion. Then he&#10;drew off his glove, produced a small book from his waist, licked&#10;the lead of his pencil and made ready to indite. He asked in a&#10;suspicious provincial accent:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Who is the man? What&#39;s his name and address?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A young man in a cycling-suit cleared his way through the ring&#10;of bystanders. He knelt down promptly beside the injured man and&#10;called for water. The constable knelt down also to help. The young&#10;man washed the blood from the injured man&#39;s mouth and then called&#10;for some brandy. The constable repeated the order in an&#10;authoritative voice until a curate came running with the glass. The&#10;brandy was forced down the man&#39;s throat. In a few seconds he opened&#10;his eyes and looked about him. He looked at the circle of faces and&#10;then, understanding, strove to rise to his feet.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You&#39;re all right now?&#34; asked the young man in the cycling-&#10;suit.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Sha,&#39;s nothing,&#34; said the injured man, trying to stand up.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He was helped to his feet. The manager said something about a&#10;hospital and some of the bystanders gave advice. The battered silk&#10;hat was placed on the man&#39;s head. The constable asked:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Where do you live?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The man, without answering, began to twirl the ends of his&#10;moustache. He made light of his accident. It was nothing, he said:&#10;only a little accident. He spoke very thickly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Where do you live&#34; repeated the constable.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The man said they were to get a cab for him. While the point was&#10;being debated a tall agile gentleman of fair complexion, wearing a&#10;long yellow ulster, came from the far end of the bar. Seeing the&#10;spectacle, he called out:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Hallo, Tom, old man! What&#39;s the trouble?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Sha,&#39;s nothing,&#34; said the man.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The new-comer surveyed the deplorable figure before him and then&#10;turned to the constable, saying:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It&#39;s all right, constable. I&#39;ll see him home.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The constable touched his helmet and answered:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;All right, Mr. Power!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Come now, Tom,&#34; said Mr. Power, taking his friend by the arm.&#10;&#34;No bones broken. What? Can you walk?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The young man in the cycling-suit took the man by the other arm&#10;and the crowd divided.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;How did you get yourself into this mess?&#34; asked Mr. Power.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The gentleman fell down the stairs,&#34; said the young man.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I&#39; &#39;ery &#39;uch o&#39;liged to you, sir,&#34; said the injured man.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Not at all.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;&#39;ant we have a little&#8230; ?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Not now. Not now.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The three men left the bar and the crowd sifted through the&#10;doors in to the laneway. The manager brought the constable to the&#10;stairs to inspect the scene of the accident. They agreed that the&#10;gentleman must have missed his footing. The customers returned to&#10;the counter and a curate set about removing the traces of blood&#10;from the floor.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When they came out into Grafton Street, Mr. Power whistled for&#10;an outsider. The injured man said again as well as he could.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I&#39; &#39;ery &#39;uch o&#39;liged to you, sir. I hope we&#39;ll &#39;eet again. &#39;y&#10;na&#39;e is Kernan.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The shock and the incipient pain had partly sobered him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Don&#39;t mention it,&#34; said the young man.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;They shook hands. Mr. Kernan was hoisted on to the car and,&#10;while Mr. Power was giving directions to the carman, he expressed&#10;his gratitude to the young man and regretted that they could not&#10;have a little drink together.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Another time,&#34; said the young man.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The car drove off towards Westmoreland Street. As it passed&#10;Ballast Office the clock showed half-past nine. A keen east wind&#10;hit them, blowing from the mouth of the river. Mr. Kernan was&#10;huddled together with cold. His friend asked him to tell how the&#10;accident had happened.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I&#39;an&#39;t &#39;an,&#34; he answered, &#34;&#39;y &#39;ongue is hurt.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Show.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The other leaned over the well of the car and peered into Mr.&#10;Kernan&#39;s mouth but he could not see. He struck a match and,&#10;sheltering it in the shell of his hands, peered again into the&#10;mouth which Mr. Kernan opened obediently. The swaying movement of&#10;the car brought the match to and from the opened mouth. The lower&#10;teeth and gums were covered with clotted blood and a minute piece&#10;of the tongue seemed to have been bitten off. The match was blown&#10;out.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That&#39;s ugly,&#34; said Mr. Power.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Sha, &#39;s nothing,&#34; said Mr. Kernan, closing his mouth and&#10;pulling the collar of his filthy coat across his neck.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Kernan was a commercial traveller of the old school which&#10;believed in the dignity of its calling. He had never been seen in&#10;the city without a silk hat of some decency and a pair of gaiters.&#10;By grace of these two articles of clothing, he said, a man could&#10;always pass muster. He carried on the tradition of his Napoleon,&#10;the great Blackwhite, whose memory he evoked at times by legend and&#10;mimicry. Modern business methods had spared him only so far as to&#10;allow him a little office in Crowe Street, on the window blind of&#10;which was written the name of his firm with the address&#8212;London, E.&#10;C. On the mantelpiece of this little office a little leaden&#10;battalion of canisters was drawn up and on the table before the&#10;window stood four or five china bowls which were usually half full&#10;of a black liquid. From these bowls Mr. Kernan tasted tea. He took&#10;a mouthful, drew it up, saturated his palate with it and then spat&#10;it forth into the grate. Then he paused to judge.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Power, a much younger man, was employed in the Royal Irish&#10;Constabulary Office in Dublin Castle. The arc of his social rise&#10;intersected the arc of his friend&#39;s decline, but Mr. Kernan&#39;s&#10;decline was mitigated by the fact that certain of those friends who&#10;had known him at his highest point of success still esteemed him as&#10;a character. Mr. Power was one of these friends. His inexplicable&#10;debts were a byword in his circle; he was a debonair young man.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The car halted before a small house on the Glasnevin road and&#10;Mr. Kernan was helped into the house. His wife put him to bed while&#10;Mr. Power sat downstairs in the kitchen asking the children where&#10;they went to school and what book they were in. The children&#8212; two&#10;girls and a boy, conscious of their father helplessness and of&#10;their mother&#39;s absence, began some horseplay with him. He was&#10;surprised at their manners and at their accents, and his brow grew&#10;thoughtful. After a while Mrs. Kernan entered the kitchen,&#10;exclaiming:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Such a sight! O, he&#39;ll do for himself one day and that&#39;s the&#10;holy alls of it. He&#39;s been drinking since Friday.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Power was careful to explain to her that he was not&#10;responsible, that he had come on the scene by the merest accident.&#10;Mrs. Kernan, remembering Mr. Power&#39;s good offices during domestic&#10;quarrels, as well as many small, but opportune loans, said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O, you needn&#39;t tell me that, Mr. Power. I know you&#39;re a friend&#10;of his, not like some of the others he does be with. They&#39;re all&#10;right so long as he has money in his pocket to keep him out from&#10;his wife and family. Nice friends! Who was he with tonight, I&#39;d&#10;like to know?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Power shook his head but said nothing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I&#39;m so sorry,&#34; she continued, &#34;that I&#39;ve nothing in the house&#10;to offer you. But if you wait a minute I&#39;ll send round to&#10;Fogarty&#39;s, at the corner.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Power stood up.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;We were waiting for him to come home with the money. He never&#10;seems to think he has a home at all.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O, now, Mrs. Kernan,&#34; said Mr. Power, &#34;we&#39;ll make him turn over&#10;a new leaf. I&#39;ll talk to Martin. He&#39;s the man. We&#39;ll come here one&#10;of these nights and talk it over.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She saw him to the door. The carman was stamping up and down the&#10;footpath, and swinging his arms to warm himself.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It&#39;s very kind of you to bring him home,&#34; she said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Not at all,&#34; said Mr. Power.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He got up on the car. As it drove off he raised his hat to her&#10;gaily.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;We&#39;ll make a new man of him,&#34; he said. &#34;Good-night, Mrs.&#10;Kernan.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mrs. Kernan&#39;s puzzled eyes watched the car till it was out of&#10;sight. Then she withdrew them, went into the house and emptied her&#10;husband&#39;s pockets.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She was an active, practical woman of middle age. Not long&#10;before she had celebrated her silver wedding and renewed her&#10;intimacy with her husband by waltzing with him to Mr. Power&#39;s&#10;accompaniment. In her days of courtship, Mr. Kernan had seemed to&#10;her a not ungallant figure: and she still hurried to the chapel&#10;door whenever a wedding was reported and, seeing the bridal pair,&#10;recalled with vivid pleasure how she had passed out of the Star of&#10;the Sea Church in Sandymount, leaning on the arm of a jovial&#10;well-fed man, who was dressed smartly in a frock-coat and lavender&#10;trousers and carried a silk hat gracefully balanced upon his other&#10;arm. After three weeks she had found a wife&#39;s life irksome and,&#10;later on, when she was beginning to find it unbearable, she had&#10;become a mother. The part of mother presented to her no insuperable&#10;difficulties and for twenty-five years she had kept house shrewdly&#10;for her husband. Her two eldest sons were launched. One was in a&#10;draper&#39;s shop in Glasgow and the other was clerk to a tea- merchant&#10;in Belfast. They were good sons, wrote regularly and sometimes sent&#10;home money. The other children were still at school.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Kernan sent a letter to his office next day and remained in&#10;bed. She made beef-tea for him and scolded him roundly. She&#10;accepted his frequent intemperance as part of the climate, healed&#10;him dutifully whenever he was sick and always tried to make him eat&#10;a breakfast. There were worse husbands. He had never been violent&#10;since the boys had grown up, and she knew that he would walk to the&#10;end of Thomas Street and back again to book even a small order.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Two nights after, his friends came to see him. She brought them&#10;up to his bedroom, the air of which was impregnated with a personal&#10;odour, and gave them chairs at the fire. Mr. Kernan&#39;s tongue, the&#10;occasional stinging pain of which had made him somewhat irritable&#10;during the day, became more polite. He sat propped up in the bed by&#10;pillows and the little colour in his puffy cheeks made them&#10;resemble warm cinders. He apologised to his guests for the disorder&#10;of the room, but at the same time looked at them a little proudly,&#10;with a veteran&#39;s pride.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He was quite unconscious that he was the victim of a plot which&#10;his friends, Mr. Cunningham, Mr. M&#39;Coy and Mr. Power had disclosed&#10;to Mrs. Kernan in the parlour. The idea been Mr. Power&#39;s, but its&#10;development was entrusted to Mr. Cunningham. Mr. Kernan came of&#10;Protestant stock and, though he had been converted to the Catholic&#10;faith at the time of his marriage, he had not been in the pale of&#10;the Church for twenty years. He was fond, moreover, of giving&#10;side-thrusts at Catholicism.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Cunningham was the very man for such a case. He was an elder&#10;colleague of Mr. Power. His own domestic life was very happy.&#10;People had great sympathy with him, for it was known that he had&#10;married an unpresentable woman who was an incurable drunkard. He&#10;had set up house for her six times; and each time she had pawned&#10;the furniture on him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Everyone had respect for poor Martin Cunningham. He was a&#10;thoroughly sensible man, influential and intelligent. His blade of&#10;human knowledge, natural astuteness particularised by long&#10;association with cases in the police courts, had been tempered by&#10;brief immersions in the waters of general philosophy. He was well&#10;informed. His friends bowed to his opinions and considered that his&#10;face was like Shakespeare&#39;s.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When the plot had been disclosed to her, Mrs. Kernan had&#10;said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I leave it all in your hands, Mr. Cunningham.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;After a quarter of a century of married life, she had very few&#10;illusions left. Religion for her was a habit, and she suspected&#10;that a man of her husband&#39;s age would not change greatly before&#10;death. She was tempted to see a curious appropriateness in his&#10;accident and, but that she did not wish to seem bloody-minded,&#10;would have told the gentlemen that Mr. Kernan&#39;s tongue would not&#10;suffer by being shortened. However, Mr. Cunningham was a capable&#10;man; and religion was religion. The scheme might do good and, at&#10;least, it could do no harm. Her beliefs were not extravagant. She&#10;believed steadily in the Sacred Heart as the most generally useful&#10;of all Catholic devotions and approved of the sacraments. Her faith&#10;was bounded by her kitchen, but, if she was put to it, she could&#10;believe also in the banshee and in the Holy Ghost.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The gentlemen began to talk of the accident. Mr. Cunningham said&#10;that he had once known a similar case. A man of seventy had bitten&#10;off a piece of his tongue during an epileptic fit and the tongue&#10;had filled in again, so that no one could see a trace of the&#10;bite.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well, I&#39;m not seventy,&#34; said the invalid.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;God forbid,&#34; said Mr. Cunningham.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It doesn&#39;t pain you now?&#34; asked Mr. M&#39;Coy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. M&#39;Coy had been at one time a tenor of some reputation. His&#10;wife, who had been a soprano, still taught young children to play&#10;the piano at low terms. His line of life had not been the shortest&#10;distance between two points and for short periods he had been&#10;driven to live by his wits. He had been a clerk in the Midland&#10;Railway, a canvasser for advertisements for The Irish Times and for&#10;The Freeman&#39;s Journal, a town traveller for a coal firm on&#10;commission, a private inquiry agent, a clerk in the office of the&#10;Sub-Sheriff, and he had recently become secretary to the City&#10;Coroner. His new office made him professionally interested in Mr.&#10;Kernan&#39;s case.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Pain? Not much,&#34; answered Mr. Kernan. &#34;But it&#39;s so sickening. I&#10;feel as if I wanted to retch off.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That&#39;s the boose,&#34; said Mr. Cunningham firmly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No,&#34; said Mr. Kernan. &#34;I think I caught cold on the car.&#10;There&#39;s something keeps coming into my throat, phlegm or&#8212;&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Mucus.&#34; said Mr. M&#39;Coy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It keeps coming like from down in my throat; sickening.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, yes,&#34; said Mr. M&#39;Coy, &#34;that&#39;s the thorax.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He looked at Mr. Cunningham and Mr. Power at the same time with&#10;an air of challenge. Mr. Cunningham nodded his head rapidly and Mr.&#10;Power said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ah, well, all&#39;s well that ends well.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I&#39;m very much obliged to you, old man,&#34; said the invalid.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Power waved his hand.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Those other two fellows I was with&#8212;&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Who were you with?&#34; asked Mr. Cunningham.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;A chap. I don&#39;t know his name. Damn it now, what&#39;s his name?&#10;Little chap with sandy hair&#8230; .&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And who else?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Harford.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Hm,&#34; said Mr. Cunningham.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When Mr. Cunningham made that remark, people were silent. It was&#10;known that the speaker had secret sources of information. In this&#10;case the monosyllable had a moral intention. Mr. Harford sometimes&#10;formed one of a little detachment which left the city shortly after&#10;noon on Sunday with the purpose of arriving as soon as possible at&#10;some public-house on the outskirts of the city where its members&#10;duly qualified themselves as bona fide travellers. But his&#10;fellow-travellers had never consented to overlook his origin. He&#10;had begun life as an obscure financier by lending small sums of&#10;money to workmen at usurious interest. Later on he had become the&#10;partner of a very fat, short gentleman, Mr. Goldberg, in the Liffey&#10;Loan Bank. Though he had never embraced more than the Jewish&#10;ethical code, his fellow-Catholics, whenever they had smarted in&#10;person or by proxy under his exactions, spoke of him bitterly as an&#10;Irish Jew and an illiterate, and saw divine disapproval of usury&#10;made manifest through the person of his idiot son. At other times&#10;they remembered his good points.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I wonder where did he go to,&#34; said Mr. Kernan.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He wished the details of the incident to remain vague. He wished&#10;his friends to think there had been some mistake, that Mr. Harford&#10;and he had missed each other. His friends, who knew quite well Mr.&#10;Harford&#39;s manners in drinking were silent. Mr. Power said&#10;again:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;All&#39;s well that ends well.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Kernan changed the subject at once.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That was a decent young chap, that medical fellow,&#34; he said.&#10;&#34;Only for him&#8212;&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O, only for him,&#34; said Mr. Power, &#34;it might have been a case of&#10;seven days, without the option of a fine.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, yes,&#34; said Mr. Kernan, trying to remember. &#34;I remember now&#10;there was a policeman. Decent young fellow, he seemed. How did it&#10;happen at all?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It happened that you were peloothered, Tom,&#34; said Mr.&#10;Cunningham gravely.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;True bill,&#34; said Mr. Kernan, equally gravely.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I suppose you squared the constable, Jack,&#34; said Mr. M&#39;Coy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Power did not relish the use of his Christian name. He was&#10;not straight-laced, but he could not forget that Mr. M&#39;Coy had&#10;recently made a crusade in search of valises and portmanteaus to&#10;enable Mrs. M&#39;Coy to fulfil imaginary engagements in the country.&#10;More than he resented the fact that he had been victimised he&#10;resented such low playing of the game. He answered the question,&#10;therefore, as if Mr. Kernan had asked it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The narrative made Mr. Kernan indignant. He was keenly conscious&#10;of his citizenship, wished to live with his city on terms mutually&#10;honourable and resented any affront put upon him by those whom he&#10;called country bumpkins.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Is this what we pay rates for?&#34; he asked. &#34;To feed and clothe&#10;these ignorant bostooms&#8230; and they&#39;re nothing else.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Cunningham laughed. He was a Castle official only during&#10;office hours.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;How could they be anything else, Tom?&#34; he said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He assumed a thick, provincial accent and said in a tone of&#10;command:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;65, catch your cabbage!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Everyone laughed. Mr. M&#39;Coy, who wanted to enter the&#10;conversation by any door, pretended that he had never heard the&#10;story. Mr. Cunningham said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It is supposed&#8212;they say, you know&#8212;to take place in the depot&#10;where they get these thundering big country fellows, omadhauns, you&#10;know, to drill. The sergeant makes them stand in a row against the&#10;wall and hold up their plates.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He illustrated the story by grotesque gestures.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;At dinner, you know. Then he has a bloody big bowl of cabbage&#10;before him on the table and a bloody big spoon like a shovel. He&#10;takes up a wad of cabbage on the spoon and pegs it across the room&#10;and the poor devils have to try and catch it on their plates: 65,&#10;catch your cabbage.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Everyone laughed again: but Mr. Kernan was somewhat indignant&#10;still. He talked of writing a letter to the papers.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;These yahoos coming up here,&#34; he said, &#34;think they can boss the&#10;people. I needn&#39;t tell you, Martin, what kind of men they are.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Cunningham gave a qualified assent.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It&#39;s like everything else in this world,&#34; he said. &#34;You get&#10;some bad ones and you get some good ones.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O yes, you get some good ones, I admit,&#34; said Mr. Kernan,&#10;satisfied.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It&#39;s better to have nothing to say to them,&#34; said Mr. M&#39;Coy.&#10;&#34;That&#39;s my opinion!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mrs. Kernan entered the room and, placing a tray on the table,&#10;said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Help yourselves, gentlemen.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Power stood up to officiate, offering her his chair. She&#10;declined it, saying she was ironing downstairs, and, after having&#10;exchanged a nod with Mr. Cunningham behind Mr. Power&#39;s back,&#10;prepared to leave the room. Her husband called out to her:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And have you nothing for me, duckie?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O, you! The back of my hand to you!&#34; said Mrs. Kernan&#10;tartly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Her husband called after her:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Nothing for poor little hubby!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He assumed such a comical face and voice that the distribution&#10;of the bottles of stout took place amid general merriment.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The gentlemen drank from their glasses, set the glasses again on&#10;the table and paused. Then Mr. Cunningham turned towards Mr. Power&#10;and said casually:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;On Thursday night, you said, Jack &#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Thursday, yes,&#34; said Mr. Power.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Righto!&#34; said Mr. Cunningham promptly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;We can meet in M&#39;Auley&#39;s,&#34; said Mr. M&#39;Coy. &#34;That&#39;ll be the most&#10;convenient place.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But we mustn&#39;t be late,&#34; said Mr. Power earnestly, &#34;because it&#10;is sure to be crammed to the doors.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;We can meet at half-seven,&#34; said Mr. M&#39;Coy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Righto!&#34; said Mr. Cunningham.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Half-seven at M&#39;Auley&#39;s be it!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There was a short silence. Mr. Kernan waited to see whether he&#10;would be taken into his friends&#39; confidence. Then he asked:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What&#39;s in the wind?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O, it&#39;s nothing,&#34; said Mr. Cunningham. &#34;It&#39;s only a little&#10;matter that we&#39;re arranging about for Thursday.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The opera, is it?&#34; said Mr. Kernan.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No, no,&#34; said Mr. Cunningham in an evasive tone, &#34;it&#39;s just a&#10;little&#8230; spiritual matter.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;0,&#34; said Mr. Kernan.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There was silence again. Then Mr. Power said, point blank:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;To tell you the truth, Tom, we&#39;re going to make a retreat.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, that&#39;s it,&#34; said Mr. Cunningham, &#34;Jack and I and M&#39;Coy&#10;here &#8212;we&#39;re all going to wash the pot.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He uttered the metaphor with a certain homely energy and,&#10;encouraged by his own voice, proceeded:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You see, we may as well all admit we&#39;re a nice collection of&#10;scoundrels, one and all. I say, one and all,&#34; he added with gruff&#10;charity and turning to Mr. Power. &#34;Own up now!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I own up,&#34; said Mr. Power.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And I own up,&#34; said Mr. M&#39;Coy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;So we&#39;re going to wash the pot together,&#34; said Mr.&#10;Cunningham.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A thought seemed to strike him. He turned suddenly to the&#10;invalid and said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;D&#39;ye know what, Tom, has just occurred to me? You night join in&#10;and we&#39;d have a four-handed reel.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Good idea,&#34; said Mr. Power. &#34;The four of us together.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Kernan was silent. The proposal conveyed very little meaning&#10;to his mind, but, understanding that some spiritual agencies were&#10;about to concern themselves on his behalf, he thought he owed it to&#10;his dignity to show a stiff neck. He took no part in the&#10;conversation for a long while, but listened, with an air of calm&#10;enmity, while his friends discussed the Jesuits.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I haven&#39;t such a bad opinion of the Jesuits,&#34; he said,&#10;intervening at length. &#34;They&#39;re an educated order. I believe they&#10;mean well, too.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;They&#39;re the grandest order in the Church, Tom,&#34; said Mr.&#10;Cunningham, with enthusiasm. &#34;The General of the Jesuits stands&#10;next to the Pope.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;There&#39;s no mistake about it,&#34; said Mr. M&#39;Coy, &#34;if you want a&#10;thing well done and no flies about, you go to a Jesuit. They&#39;re the&#10;boyos have influence. I&#39;ll tell you a case in point&#8230; .&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The Jesuits are a fine body of men,&#34; said Mr. Power.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It&#39;s a curious thing,&#34; said Mr. Cunningham, &#34;about the Jesuit&#10;Order. Every other order of the Church had to be reformed at some&#10;time or other but the Jesuit Order was never once reformed. It&#10;never fell away.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Is that so?&#34; asked Mr. M&#39;Coy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That&#39;s a fact,&#34; said Mr. Cunningham. &#34;That&#39;s history.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Look at their church, too,&#34; said Mr. Power. &#34;Look at the&#10;congregation they have.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The Jesuits cater for the upper classes,&#34; said Mr. M&#39;Coy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Of course,&#34; said Mr. Power.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes,&#34; said Mr. Kernan. &#34;That&#39;s why I have a feeling for them.&#10;It&#39;s some of those secular priests, ignorant, bumptious&#8212;&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;They&#39;re all good men,&#34; said Mr. Cunningham, &#34;each in his own&#10;way. The Irish priesthood is honoured all the world over.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O yes,&#34; said Mr. Power.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Not like some of the other priesthoods on the continent,&#34; said&#10;Mr. M&#39;Coy, &#34;unworthy of the name.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Perhaps you&#39;re right,&#34; said Mr. Kernan, relenting.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Of course I&#39;m right,&#34; said Mr. Cunningham. &#34;I haven&#39;t been in&#10;the world all this time and seen most sides of it without being a&#10;judge of character.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The gentlemen drank again, one following another&#39;s example. Mr.&#10;Kernan seemed to be weighing something in his mind. He was&#10;impressed. He had a high opinion of Mr. Cunningham as a judge of&#10;character and as a reader of faces. He asked for particulars.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O, it&#39;s just a retreat, you know,&#34; said Mr. Cunningham. &#34;Father&#10;Purdon is giving it. It&#39;s for business men, you know.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;He won&#39;t be too hard on us, Tom,&#34; said Mr. Power&#10;persuasively.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Father Purdon? Father Purdon?&#34; said the invalid.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O, you must know him, Tom,&#34; said Mr. Cunningham stoutly. &#34;Fine,&#10;jolly fellow! He&#39;s a man of the world like ourselves.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ah,&#8230; yes. I think I know him. Rather red face; tall.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That&#39;s the man.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And tell me, Martin&#8230; . Is he a good preacher?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Munno&#8230; . It&#39;s not exactly a sermon, you know. It&#39;s just kind of&#10;a friendly talk, you know, in a common-sense way.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Kernan deliberated. Mr. M&#39;Coy said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Father Tom Burke, that was the boy!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O, Father Tom Burke,&#34; said Mr. Cunningham, &#34;that was a born&#10;orator. Did you ever hear him, Tom?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Did I ever hear him!&#34; said the invalid, nettled. &#34;Rather! I&#10;heard him&#8230; .&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And yet they say he wasn&#39;t much of a theologian,&#34; said Mr&#10;Cunningham.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Is that so?&#34; said Mr. M&#39;Coy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O, of course, nothing wrong, you know. Only sometimes, they&#10;say, he didn&#39;t preach what was quite orthodox.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ah!&#8230; he was a splendid man,&#34; said Mr. M&#39;Coy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I heard him once,&#34; Mr. Kernan continued. &#34;I forget the subject&#10;of his discourse now. Crofton and I were in the back of the&#8230; pit,&#10;you know&#8230; the&#8212;&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The body,&#34; said Mr. Cunningham.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, in the back near the door. I forget now what&#8230; . O yes, it&#10;was on the Pope, the late Pope. I remember it well. Upon my word it&#10;was magnificent, the style of the oratory. And his voice! God!&#10;hadn&#39;t he a voice! The Prisoner of the Vatican, he called him. I&#10;remember Crofton saying to me when we came out&#8212;&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But he&#39;s an Orangeman, Crofton, isn&#39;t he?&#34; said Mr. Power.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;&#39;Course he is,&#34; said Mr. Kernan, &#34;and a damned decent Orangeman&#10;too. We went into Butler&#39;s in Moore Street&#8212;faith, was genuinely&#10;moved, tell you the God&#39;s truth&#8212;and I remember well his very words.&#10;Kernan, he said, we worship at different altars, he said, but our&#10;belief is the same. Struck me as very well put.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;There&#39;s a good deal in that,&#34; said Mr. Power. &#34;There used&#10;always be crowds of Protestants in the chapel where Father Tom was&#10;preaching.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;There&#39;s not much difference between us,&#34; said Mr. M&#39;Coy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;We both believe in&#8212;&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He hesitated for a moment.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;&#8230; in the Redeemer. Only they don&#39;t believe in the Pope and in&#10;the mother of God.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But, of course,&#34; said Mr. Cunningham quietly and effectively,&#10;&#34;our religion is the religion, the old, original faith.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Not a doubt of it,&#34; said Mr. Kernan warmly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mrs. Kernan came to the door of the bedroom and announced:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Here&#39;s a visitor for you!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Who is it?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Mr. Fogarty.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O, come in! come in!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A pale, oval face came forward into the light. The arch of its&#10;fair trailing moustache was repeated in the fair eyebrows looped&#10;above pleasantly astonished eyes. Mr. Fogarty was a modest grocer.&#10;He had failed in business in a licensed house in the city because&#10;his financial condition had constrained him to tie himself to&#10;second-class distillers and brewers. He had opened a small shop on&#10;Glasnevin Road where, he flattered himself, his manners would&#10;ingratiate him with the housewives of the district. He bore himself&#10;with a certain grace, complimented little children and spoke with a&#10;neat enunciation. He was not without culture.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Fogarty brought a gift with him, a half-pint of special&#10;whisky. He inquired politely for Mr. Kernan, placed his gift on the&#10;table and sat down with the company on equal terms. Mr. Kernan&#10;appreciated the gift all the more since he was aware that there was&#10;a small account for groceries unsettled between him and Mr.&#10;Fogarty. He said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I wouldn&#39;t doubt you, old man. Open that, Jack, will you?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Power again officiated. Glasses were rinsed and five small&#10;measures of whisky were poured out. This new influence enlivened&#10;the conversation. Mr. Fogarty, sitting on a small area of the&#10;chair, was specially interested.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Pope Leo XIII,&#34; said Mr. Cunningham, &#34;was one of the lights of&#10;the age. His great idea, you know, was the union of the Latin and&#10;Greek Churches. That was the aim of his life.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I often heard he was one of the most intellectual men in&#10;Europe,&#34; said Mr. Power. &#34;I mean, apart from his being Pope.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;So he was,&#34; said Mr. Cunningham, &#34;if not the most so. His&#10;motto, you know, as Pope, was Lux upon Lux&#8212;Light upon Light.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No, no,&#34; said Mr. Fogarty eagerly. &#34;I think you&#39;re wrong there.&#10;It was Lux in Tenebris, I think&#8212;Light in Darkness.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O yes,&#34; said Mr. M&#39;Coy, &#34;Tenebrae.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Allow me,&#34; said Mr. Cunningham positively, &#34;it was Lux upon&#10;Lux. And Pius IX his predecessor&#39;s motto was Crux upon Crux&#8212; that&#10;is, Cross upon Cross&#8212;to show the difference between their two&#10;pontificates.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The inference was allowed. Mr. Cunningham continued.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Pope Leo, you know, was a great scholar and a poet.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;He had a strong face,&#34; said Mr. Kernan.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes,&#34; said Mr. Cunningham. &#34;He wrote Latin poetry.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Is that so?&#34; said Mr. Fogarty.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. M&#39;Coy tasted his whisky contentedly and shook his head with&#10;a double intention, saying:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That&#39;s no joke, I can tell you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;We didn&#39;t learn that, Tom,&#34; said Mr. Power, following Mr.&#10;M&#39;Coy&#39;s example, &#34;when we went to the penny-a-week school.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;There was many a good man went to the penny-a-week school with&#10;a sod of turf under his oxter,&#34; said Mr. Kernan sententiously. &#34;The&#10;old system was the best: plain honest education. None of your&#10;modern trumpery&#8230; .&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Quite right,&#34; said Mr. Power.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No superfluities,&#34; said Mr. Fogarty.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He enunciated the word and then drank gravely.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I remember reading,&#34; said Mr. Cunningham, &#34;that one of Pope&#10;Leo&#39;s poems was on the invention of the photograph&#8212;in Latin, of&#10;course.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;On the photograph!&#34; exclaimed Mr. Kernan.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes,&#34; said Mr. Cunningham.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He also drank from his glass.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well, you know,&#34; said Mr. M&#39;Coy, &#34;isn&#39;t the photograph&#10;wonderful when you come to think of it?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O, of course,&#34; said Mr. Power, &#34;great minds can see&#10;things.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;As the poet says: Great minds are very near to madness,&#34; said&#10;Mr. Fogarty.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Kernan seemed to be troubled in mind. He made an effort to&#10;recall the Protestant theology on some thorny points and in the end&#10;addressed Mr. Cunningham.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Tell me, Martin,&#34; he said. &#34;Weren&#39;t some of the popes&#8212;of&#10;course, not our present man, or his predecessor, but some of the&#10;old popes&#8212;not exactly&#38;#160;&#8230; you know&#8230; up to the knocker?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There was a silence. Mr. Cunningham said&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O, of course, there were some bad lots&#8230; But the astonishing&#10;thing is this. Not one of them, not the biggest drunkard, not the&#10;most&#8230; out-and-out ruffian, not one of them ever preached ex&#10;cathedra a word of false doctrine. Now isn&#39;t that an astonishing&#10;thing?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That is,&#34; said Mr. Kernan.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, because when the Pope speaks ex cathedra,&#34; Mr. Fogarty&#10;explained, &#34;he is infallible.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes,&#34; said Mr. Cunningham.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O, I know about the infallibility of the Pope. I remember I was&#10;younger then&#8230; . Or was it that&#8212;&#8212;?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Fogarty interrupted. He took up the bottle and helped the&#10;others to a little more. Mr. M&#39;Coy, seeing that there was not&#10;enough to go round, pleaded that he had not finished his first&#10;measure. The others accepted under protest. The light music of&#10;whisky falling into glasses made an agreeable interlude.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What&#39;s that you were saying, Tom?&#34; asked Mr. M&#39;Coy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Papal infallibility,&#34; said Mr. Cunningham, &#34;that was the&#10;greatest scene in the whole history of the Church.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;How was that, Martin?&#34; asked Mr. Power.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Cunningham held up two thick fingers.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;In the sacred college, you know, of cardinals and archbishops&#10;and bishops there were two men who held out against it while the&#10;others were all for it. The whole conclave except these two was&#10;unanimous. No! They wouldn&#39;t have it!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ha!&#34; said Mr. M&#39;Coy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And they were a German cardinal by the name of Dolling&#8230; or&#10;Dowling&#8230; or&#8212;&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Dowling was no German, and that&#39;s a sure five,&#34; said Mr. Power,&#10;laughing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well, this great German cardinal, whatever his name was, was&#10;one; and the other was John MacHale.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What?&#34; cried Mr. Kernan. &#34;Is it John of Tuam?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Are you sure of that now?&#34; asked Mr. Fogarty dubiously. &#34;I&#10;thought it was some Italian or American.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;John of Tuam,&#34; repeated Mr. Cunningham, &#34;was the man.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He drank and the other gentlemen followed his lead. Then he&#10;resumed:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;There they were at it, all the cardinals and bishops and&#10;archbishops from all the ends of the earth and these two fighting&#10;dog and devil until at last the Pope himself stood up and declared&#10;infallibility a dogma of the Church ex cathedra. On the very moment&#10;John MacHale, who had been arguing and arguing against it, stood up&#10;and shouted out with the voice of a lion: &#39;Credo!&#39;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I believe!&#34; said Mr. Fogarty.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Credo!&#34; said Mr. Cunningham &#34;That showed the faith he had. He&#10;submitted the moment the Pope spoke.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And what about Dowling?&#34; asked Mr. M&#39;Coy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The German cardinal wouldn&#39;t submit. He left the church.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Cunningham&#39;s words had built up the vast image of the church&#10;in the minds of his hearers. His deep, raucous voice had thrilled&#10;them as it uttered the word of belief and submission. When Mrs.&#10;Kernan came into the room, drying her hands she came into a solemn&#10;company. She did not disturb the silence, but leaned over the rail&#10;at the foot of the bed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I once saw John MacHale,&#34; said Mr. Kernan, &#34;and I&#39;ll never&#10;forget it as long as I live.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He turned towards his wife to be confirmed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I often told you that?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mrs. Kernan nodded.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It was at the unveiling of Sir John Gray&#39;s statue. Edmund Dwyer&#10;Gray was speaking, blathering away, and here was this old fellow,&#10;crabbed-looking old chap, looking at him from under his bushy&#10;eyebrows.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Kernan knitted his brows and, lowering his head like an&#10;angry bull, glared at his wife.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;God!&#34; he exclaimed, resuming his natural face, &#34;I never saw&#10;such an eye in a man&#39;s head. It was as much as to say: I have you&#10;properly taped, my lad. He had an eye like a hawk.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;None of the Grays was any good,&#34; said Mr. Power.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There was a pause again. Mr. Power turned to Mrs. Kernan and&#10;said with abrupt joviality:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well, Mrs. Kernan, we&#39;re going to make your man here a good&#10;holy pious and God-fearing Roman Catholic.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He swept his arm round the company inclusively.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;We&#39;re all going to make a retreat together and confess our&#10;sins&#8212; and God knows we want it badly.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I don&#39;t mind,&#34; said Mr. Kernan, smiling a little nervously.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mrs. Kernan thought it would be wiser to conceal her&#10;satisfaction. So she said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I pity the poor priest that has to listen to your tale.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Kernan&#39;s expression changed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;If he doesn&#39;t like it,&#34; he said bluntly, &#34;he can&#8230; do the other&#10;thing. I&#39;ll just tell him my little tale of woe. I&#39;m not such a bad&#10;fellow&#8212;&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Cunningham intervened promptly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;We&#39;ll all renounce the devil,&#34; he said, &#34;together, not&#10;forgetting his works and pomps.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Get behind me, Satan!&#34; said Mr. Fogarty, laughing and looking&#10;at the others.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Power said nothing. He felt completely out-generalled. But a&#10;pleased expression flickered across his face.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;All we have to do,&#34; said Mr. Cunningham, &#34;is to stand up with&#10;lighted candles in our hands and renew our baptismal vows.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O, don&#39;t forget the candle, Tom,&#34; said Mr. M&#39;Coy, &#34;whatever you&#10;do.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What?&#34; said Mr. Kernan. &#34;Must I have a candle?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O yes,&#34; said Mr. Cunningham.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No, damn it all,&#34; said Mr. Kernan sensibly, &#34;I draw the line&#10;there. I&#39;ll do the job right enough. I&#39;ll do the retreat business&#10;and confession, and&#8230; all that business. But&#8230; no candles! No, damn&#10;it all, I bar the candles!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He shook his head with farcical gravity.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Listen to that!&#34; said his wife.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I bar the candles,&#34; said Mr. Kernan, conscious of having&#10;created an effect on his audience and continuing to shake his head&#10;to and fro. &#34;I bar the magic-lantern business.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Everyone laughed heartily.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;There&#39;s a nice Catholic for you!&#34; said his wife.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No candles!&#34; repeated Mr. Kernan obdurately. &#34;That&#39;s off!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The transept of the Jesuit Church in Gardiner Street was almost&#10;full; and still at every moment gentlemen entered from the side&#10;door and, directed by the lay-brother, walked on tiptoe along the&#10;aisles until they found seating accommodation. The gentlemen were&#10;all well dressed and orderly. The light of the lamps of the church&#10;fell upon an assembly of black clothes and white collars, relieved&#10;here and there by tweeds, on dark mottled pillars of green marble&#10;and on lugubrious canvases. The gentlemen sat in the benches,&#10;having hitched their trousers slightly above their knees and laid&#10;their hats in security. They sat well back and gazed formally at&#10;the distant speck of red light which was suspended before the high&#10;altar.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In one of the benches near the pulpit sat Mr. Cunningham and Mr.&#10;Kernan. In the bench behind sat Mr. M&#39;Coy alone: and in the bench&#10;behind him sat Mr. Power and Mr. Fogarty. Mr. M&#39;Coy had tried&#10;unsuccessfully to find a place in the bench with the others, and,&#10;when the party had settled down in the form of a quincunx, he had&#10;tried unsuccessfully to make comic remarks. As these had not been&#10;well received, he had desisted. Even he was sensible of the&#10;decorous atmosphere and even he began to respond to the religious&#10;stimulus. In a whisper, Mr. Cunningham drew Mr. Kernan&#39;s attention&#10;to Mr. Harford, the moneylender, who sat some distance off, and to&#10;Mr. Fanning, the registration agent and mayor maker of the city,&#10;who was sitting immediately under the pulpit beside one of the&#10;newly elected councillors of the ward. To the right sat old Michael&#10;Grimes, the owner of three pawnbroker&#39;s shops, and Dan Hogan&#39;s&#10;nephew, who was up for the job in the Town Clerk&#39;s office. Farther&#10;in front sat Mr. Hendrick, the chief reporter of The Freeman&#39;s&#10;Journal, and poor O&#39;Carroll, an old friend of Mr. Kernan&#39;s, who had&#10;been at one time a considerable commercial figure. Gradually, as he&#10;recognised familiar faces, Mr. Kernan began to feel more at home.&#10;His hat, which had been rehabilitated by his wife, rested upon his&#10;knees. Once or twice he pulled down his cuffs with one hand while&#10;he held the brim of his hat lightly, but firmly, with the other&#10;hand.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A powerful-looking figure, the upper part of which was draped&#10;with a white surplice, was observed to be struggling into the&#10;pulpit. Simultaneously the congregation unsettled, produced&#10;handkerchiefs and knelt upon them with care. Mr. Kernan followed&#10;the general example. The priest&#39;s figure now stood upright in the&#10;pulpit, two-thirds of its bulk, crowned by a massive red face,&#10;appearing above the balustrade.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Father Purdon knelt down, turned towards the red speck of light&#10;and, covering his face with his hands, prayed. After an interval,&#10;he uncovered his face and rose. The congregation rose also and&#10;settled again on its benches. Mr. Kernan restored his hat to its&#10;original position on his knee and presented an attentive face to&#10;the preacher. The preacher turned back each wide sleeve of his&#10;surplice with an elaborate large gesture and slowly surveyed the&#10;array of faces. Then he said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;For the children of this world are wiser in their generation&#10;than the children of light. Wherefore make unto yourselves friends&#10;out of the mammon of iniquity so that when you die they may receive&#10;you into everlasting dwellings.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Father Purdon developed the text with resonant assurance. It was&#10;one of the most difficult texts in all the Scriptures, he said, to&#10;interpret properly. It was a text which might seem to the casual&#10;observer at variance with the lofty morality elsewhere preached by&#10;Jesus Christ. But, he told his hearers, the text had seemed to him&#10;specially adapted for the guidance of those whose lot it was to&#10;lead the life of the world and who yet wished to lead that life not&#10;in the manner of worldlings. It was a text for business men and&#10;professional men. Jesus Christ with His divine understanding of&#10;every cranny of our human nature, understood that all men were not&#10;called to the religious life, that by far the vast majority were&#10;forced to live in the world, and, to a certain extent, for the&#10;world: and in this sentence He designed to give them a word of&#10;counsel, setting before them as exemplars in the religious life&#10;those very worshippers of Mammon who were of all men the least&#10;solicitous in matters religious.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He told his hearers that he was there that evening for no&#10;terrifying, no extravagant purpose; but as a man of the world&#10;speaking to his fellow-men. He came to speak to business men and he&#10;would speak to them in a businesslike way. If he might use the&#10;metaphor, he said, he was their spiritual accountant; and he wished&#10;each and every one of his hearers to open his books, the books of&#10;his spiritual life, and see if they tallied accurately with&#10;conscience.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Jesus Christ was not a hard taskmaster. He understood our little&#10;failings, understood the weakness of our poor fallen nature,&#10;understood the temptations of this life. We might have had, we all&#10;had from time to time, our temptations: we might have, we all had,&#10;our failings. But one thing only, he said, he would ask of his&#10;hearers. And that was: to be straight and manly with God. If their&#10;accounts tallied in every point to say:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well, I have verified my accounts. I find all well.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But if, as might happen, there were some discrepancies, to admit&#10;the truth, to be frank and say like a man:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well, I have looked into my accounts. I find this wrong and&#10;this wrong. But, with God&#39;s grace, I will rectify this and this. I&#10;will set right my accounts.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 8, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/5', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Dead'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;LILY, the caretaker&#39;s daughter, was literally run off her feet.&#10;Hardly had she brought one gentleman into the little pantry behind&#10;the office on the ground floor and helped him off with his overcoat&#10;than the wheezy hall-door bell clanged again and she had to scamper&#10;along the bare hallway to let in another guest. It was well for her&#10;she had not to attend to the ladies also. But Miss Kate and Miss&#10;Julia had thought of that and had converted the bathroom upstairs&#10;into a ladies&#39; dressing-room. Miss Kate and Miss Julia were there,&#10;gossiping and laughing and fussing, walking after each other to the&#10;head of the stairs, peering down over the banisters and calling&#10;down to Lily to ask her who had come.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was always a great affair, the Misses Morkan&#39;s annual dance.&#10;Everybody who knew them came to it, members of the family, old&#10;friends of the family, the members of Julia&#39;s choir, any of Kate&#39;s&#10;pupils that were grown up enough, and even some of Mary Jane&#39;s&#10;pupils too. Never once had it fallen flat. For years and years it&#10;had gone off in splendid style, as long as anyone could remember;&#10;ever since Kate and Julia, after the death of their brother Pat,&#10;had left the house in Stoney Batter and taken Mary Jane, their only&#10;niece, to live with them in the dark, gaunt house on Usher&#39;s&#10;Island, the upper part of which they had rented from Mr. Fulham,&#10;the corn-factor on the ground floor. That was a good thirty years&#10;ago if it was a day. Mary Jane, who was then a little girl in short&#10;clothes, was now the main prop of the household, for she had the&#10;organ in Haddington Road. She had been through the Academy and gave&#10;a pupils&#39; concert every year in the upper room of the Antient&#10;Concert Rooms. Many of her pupils belonged to the better-class&#10;families on the Kingstown and Dalkey line. Old as they were, her&#10;aunts also did their share. Julia, though she was quite grey, was&#10;still the leading soprano in Adam and Eve&#39;s, and Kate, being too&#10;feeble to go about much, gave music lessons to beginners on the old&#10;square piano in the back room. Lily, the caretaker&#39;s daughter, did&#10;housemaid&#39;s work for them. Though their life was modest, they&#10;believed in eating well; the best of everything: diamond-bone&#10;sirloins, three-shilling tea and the best bottled stout. But Lily&#10;seldom made a mistake in the orders, so that she got on well with&#10;her three mistresses. They were fussy, that was all. But the only&#10;thing they would not stand was back answers.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Of course, they had good reason to be fussy on such a night. And&#10;then it was long after ten o&#39;clock and yet there was no sign of&#10;Gabriel and his wife. Besides they were dreadfully afraid that&#10;Freddy Malins might turn up screwed. They would not wish for worlds&#10;that any of Mary Jane&#39;s pupils should see him under the influence;&#10;and when he was like that it was sometimes very hard to manage him.&#10;Freddy Malins always came late, but they wondered what could be&#10;keeping Gabriel: and that was what brought them every two minutes&#10;to the banisters to ask Lily had Gabriel or Freddy come.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O, Mr. Conroy,&#34; said Lily to Gabriel when she opened the door&#10;for him, &#34;Miss Kate and Miss Julia thought you were never coming.&#10;Good-night, Mrs. Conroy.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I&#39;ll engage they did,&#34; said Gabriel, &#34;but they forget that my&#10;wife here takes three mortal hours to dress herself.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He stood on the mat, scraping the snow from his goloshes, while&#10;Lily led his wife to the foot of the stairs and called out:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Miss Kate, here&#39;s Mrs. Conroy.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Kate and Julia came toddling down the dark stairs at once. Both&#10;of them kissed Gabriel&#39;s wife, said she must be perished alive, and&#10;asked was Gabriel with her.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Here I am as right as the mail, Aunt Kate! Go on up. I&#39;ll&#10;follow,&#34; called out Gabriel from the dark.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He continued scraping his feet vigorously while the three women&#10;went upstairs, laughing, to the ladies&#39; dressing-room. A light&#10;fringe of snow lay like a cape on the shoulders of his overcoat and&#10;like toecaps on the toes of his goloshes; and, as the buttons of&#10;his overcoat slipped with a squeaking noise through the&#10;snow-stiffened frieze, a cold, fragrant air from out-of-doors&#10;escaped from crevices and folds.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Is it snowing again, Mr. Conroy?&#34; asked Lily.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She had preceded him into the pantry to help him off with his&#10;overcoat. Gabriel smiled at the three syllables she had given his&#10;surname and glanced at her. She was a slim; growing girl, pale in&#10;complexion and with hay-coloured hair. The gas in the pantry made&#10;her look still paler. Gabriel had known her when she was a child&#10;and used to sit on the lowest step nursing a rag doll.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, Lily,&#34; he answered, &#34;and I think we&#39;re in for a night of&#10;it.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He looked up at the pantry ceiling, which was shaking with the&#10;stamping and shuffling of feet on the floor above, listened for a&#10;moment to the piano and then glanced at the girl, who was folding&#10;his overcoat carefully at the end of a shelf.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Tell me. Lily,&#34; he said in a friendly tone, &#34;do you still go to&#10;school?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O no, sir,&#34; she answered. &#34;I&#39;m done schooling this year and&#10;more.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O, then,&#34; said Gabriel gaily, &#34;I suppose we&#39;ll be going to your&#10;wedding one of these fine days with your young man, eh? &#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The girl glanced back at him over her shoulder and said with&#10;great bitterness:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The men that is now is only all palaver and what they can get&#10;out of you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Gabriel coloured, as if he felt he had made a mistake and,&#10;without looking at her, kicked off his goloshes and flicked&#10;actively with his muffler at his patent-leather shoes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He was a stout, tallish young man. The high colour of his cheeks&#10;pushed upwards even to his forehead, where it scattered itself in a&#10;few formless patches of pale red; and on his hairless face there&#10;scintillated restlessly the polished lenses and the bright gilt&#10;rims of the glasses which screened his delicate and restless eyes.&#10;His glossy black hair was parted in the middle and brushed in a&#10;long curve behind his ears where it curled slightly beneath the&#10;groove left by his hat.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When he had flicked lustre into his shoes he stood up and pulled&#10;his waistcoat down more tightly on his plump body. Then he took a&#10;coin rapidly from his pocket.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O Lily,&#34; he said, thrusting it into her hands, &#34;it&#39;s&#10;Christmastime, isn&#39;t it? Just&#8230; here&#39;s a little&#8230; .&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He walked rapidly towards the door.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O no, sir!&#34; cried the girl, following him. &#34;Really, sir, I&#10;wouldn&#39;t take it.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Christmas-time! Christmas-time!&#34; said Gabriel, almost trotting&#10;to the stairs and waving his hand to her in deprecation.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The girl, seeing that he had gained the stairs, called out after&#10;him:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well, thank you, sir.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He waited outside the drawing-room door until the waltz should&#10;finish, listening to the skirts that swept against it and to the&#10;shuffling of feet. He was still discomposed by the girl&#39;s bitter&#10;and sudden retort. It had cast a gloom over him which he tried to&#10;dispel by arranging his cuffs and the bows of his tie. He then took&#10;from his waistcoat pocket a little paper and glanced at the&#10;headings he had made for his speech. He was undecided about the&#10;lines from Robert Browning, for he feared they would be above the&#10;heads of his hearers. Some quotation that they would recognise from&#10;Shakespeare or from the Melodies would be better. The indelicate&#10;clacking of the men&#39;s heels and the shuffling of their soles&#10;reminded him that their grade of culture differed from his. He&#10;would only make himself ridiculous by quoting poetry to them which&#10;they could not understand. They would think that he was airing his&#10;superior education. He would fail with them just as he had failed&#10;with the girl in the pantry. He had taken up a wrong tone. His&#10;whole speech was a mistake from first to last, an utter&#10;failure.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Just then his aunts and his wife came out of the ladies&#39;&#10;dressing-room. His aunts were two small, plainly dressed old women.&#10;Aunt Julia was an inch or so the taller. Her hair, drawn low over&#10;the tops of her ears, was grey; and grey also, with darker shadows,&#10;was her large flaccid face. Though she was stout in build and stood&#10;erect, her slow eyes and parted lips gave her the appearance of a&#10;woman who did not know where she was or where she was going. Aunt&#10;Kate was more vivacious. Her face, healthier than her sister&#39;s, was&#10;all puckers and creases, like a shrivelled red apple, and her hair,&#10;braided in the same old-fashioned way, had not lost its ripe nut&#10;colour.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;They both kissed Gabriel frankly. He was their favourite nephew&#10;the son of their dead elder sister, Ellen, who had married T. J.&#10;Conroy of the Port and Docks.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Gretta tells me you&#39;re not going to take a cab back to&#10;Monkstown tonight, Gabriel,&#34; said Aunt Kate.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No,&#34; said Gabriel, turning to his wife, &#34;we had quite enough of&#10;that last year, hadn&#39;t we? Don&#39;t you remember, Aunt Kate, what a&#10;cold Gretta got out of it? Cab windows rattling all the way, and&#10;the east wind blowing in after we passed Merrion. Very jolly it&#10;was. Gretta caught a dreadful cold.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Aunt Kate frowned severely and nodded her head at every&#10;word.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Quite right, Gabriel, quite right,&#34; she said. &#34;You can&#39;t be too&#10;careful.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But as for Gretta there,&#34; said Gabriel, &#34;she&#39;d walk home in the&#10;snow if she were let.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mrs. Conroy laughed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Don&#39;t mind him, Aunt Kate,&#34; she said. &#34;He&#39;s really an awful&#10;bother, what with green shades for Tom&#39;s eyes at night and making&#10;him do the dumb-bells, and forcing Eva to eat the stirabout. The&#10;poor child! And she simply hates the sight of it!&#8230; O, but you&#39;ll&#10;never guess what he makes me wear now!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She broke out into a peal of laughter and glanced at her&#10;husband, whose admiring and happy eyes had been wandering from her&#10;dress to her face and hair. The two aunts laughed heartily, too,&#10;for Gabriel&#39;s solicitude was a standing joke with them.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Goloshes!&#34; said Mrs. Conroy. &#34;That&#39;s the latest. Whenever it&#39;s&#10;wet underfoot I must put on my galoshes. Tonight even, he wanted me&#10;to put them on, but I wouldn&#39;t. The next thing he&#39;ll buy me will be&#10;a diving suit.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Gabriel laughed nervously and patted his tie reassuringly, while&#10;Aunt Kate nearly doubled herself, so heartily did she enjoy the&#10;joke. The smile soon faded from Aunt Julia&#39;s face and her mirthless&#10;eyes were directed towards her nephew&#39;s face. After a pause she&#10;asked:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And what are goloshes, Gabriel?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Goloshes, Julia!&#34; exclaimed her sister &#34;Goodness me, don&#39;t you&#10;know what goloshes are? You wear them over your&#8230; over your boots,&#10;Gretta, isn&#39;t it?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes,&#34; said Mrs. Conroy. &#34;Guttapercha things. We both have a&#10;pair now. Gabriel says everyone wears them on the Continent.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O, on the Continent,&#34; murmured Aunt Julia, nodding her head&#10;slowly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Gabriel knitted his brows and said, as if he were slightly&#10;angered:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It&#39;s nothing very wonderful, but Gretta thinks it very funny&#10;because she says the word reminds her of Christy Minstrels.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But tell me, Gabriel,&#34; said Aunt Kate, with brisk tact. &#34;Of&#10;course, you&#39;ve seen about the room. Gretta was saying&#8230; &#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;0, the room is all right,&#34; replied Gabriel. &#34;I&#39;ve taken one in&#10;the Gresham.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;To be sure,&#34; said Aunt Kate, &#34;by far the best thing to do. And&#10;the children, Gretta, you&#39;re not anxious about them?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;0, for one night,&#34; said Mrs. Conroy. &#34;Besides, Bessie will look&#10;after them.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;To be sure,&#34; said Aunt Kate again. &#34;What a comfort it is to&#10;have a girl like that, one you can depend on! There&#39;s that Lily,&#10;I&#39;m sure I don&#39;t know what has come over her lately. She&#39;s not the&#10;girl she was at all.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Gabriel was about to ask his aunt some questions on this point,&#10;but she broke off suddenly to gaze after her sister, who had&#10;wandered down the stairs and was craning her neck over the&#10;banisters.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Now, I ask you,&#34; she said almost testily, &#34;where is Julia&#10;going? Julia! Julia! Where are you going?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Julia, who had gone half way down one flight, came back and&#10;announced blandly:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Here&#39;s Freddy.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At the same moment a clapping of hands and a final flourish of&#10;the pianist told that the waltz had ended. The drawing-room door&#10;was opened from within and some couples came out. Aunt Kate drew&#10;Gabriel aside hurriedly and whispered into his ear:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Slip down, Gabriel, like a good fellow and see if he&#39;s all&#10;right, and don&#39;t let him up if he&#39;s screwed. I&#39;m sure he&#39;s screwed.&#10;I&#39;m sure he is.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Gabriel went to the stairs and listened over the banisters. He&#10;could hear two persons talking in the pantry. Then he recognised&#10;Freddy Malins&#39; laugh. He went down the stairs noisily.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It&#39;s such a relief,&#34; said Aunt Kate to Mrs. Conroy, &#34;that&#10;Gabriel is here. I always feel easier in my mind when he&#39;s here&#8230; .&#10;Julia, there&#39;s Miss Daly and Miss Power will take some refreshment.&#10;Thanks for your beautiful waltz, Miss Daly. It made lovely&#10;time.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A tall wizen-faced man, with a stiff grizzled moustache and&#10;swarthy skin, who was passing out with his partner, said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And may we have some refreshment, too, Miss Morkan?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Julia,&#34; said Aunt Kate summarily, &#34;and here&#39;s Mr. Browne and&#10;Miss Furlong. Take them in, Julia, with Miss Daly and Miss&#10;Power.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I&#39;m the man for the ladies,&#34; said Mr. Browne, pursing his lips&#10;until his moustache bristled and smiling in all his wrinkles. &#34;You&#10;know, Miss Morkan, the reason they are so fond of me is&#8212;&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He did not finish his sentence, but, seeing that Aunt Kate was&#10;out of earshot, at once led the three young ladies into the back&#10;room. The middle of the room was occupied by two square tables&#10;placed end to end, and on these Aunt Julia and the caretaker were&#10;straightening and smoothing a large cloth. On the sideboard were&#10;arrayed dishes and plates, and glasses and bundles of knives and&#10;forks and spoons. The top of the closed square piano served also as&#10;a sideboard for viands and sweets. At a smaller sideboard in one&#10;corner two young men were standing, drinking hop-bitters.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Browne led his charges thither and invited them all, in&#10;jest, to some ladies&#39; punch, hot, strong and sweet. As they said&#10;they never took anything strong, he opened three bottles of&#10;lemonade for them. Then he asked one of the young men to move&#10;aside, and, taking hold of the decanter, filled out for himself a&#10;goodly measure of whisky. The young men eyed him respectfully while&#10;he took a trial sip.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;God help me,&#34; he said, smiling, &#34;it&#39;s the doctor&#39;s orders.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;His wizened face broke into a broader smile, and the three young&#10;ladies laughed in musical echo to his pleasantry, swaying their&#10;bodies to and fro, with nervous jerks of their shoulders. The&#10;boldest said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O, now, Mr. Browne, I&#39;m sure the doctor never ordered anything&#10;of the kind.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Browne took another sip of his whisky and said, with sidling&#10;mimicry:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well, you see, I&#39;m like the famous Mrs. Cassidy, who is&#10;reported to have said: &#39;Now, Mary Grimes, if I don&#39;t take it, make&#10;me take it, for I feel I want it.&#39;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;His hot face had leaned forward a little too confidentially and&#10;he had assumed a very low Dublin accent so that the young ladies,&#10;with one instinct, received his speech in silence. Miss Furlong,&#10;who was one of Mary Jane&#39;s pupils, asked Miss Daly what was the&#10;name of the pretty waltz she had played; and Mr. Browne, seeing&#10;that he was ignored, turned promptly to the two young men who were&#10;more appreciative.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A red-faced young woman, dressed in pansy, came into the room,&#10;excitedly clapping her hands and crying:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Quadrilles! Quadrilles!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Close on her heels came Aunt Kate, crying:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Two gentlemen and three ladies, Mary Jane!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O, here&#39;s Mr. Bergin and Mr. Kerrigan,&#34; said Mary Jane. &#34;Mr.&#10;Kerrigan, will you take Miss Power? Miss Furlong, may I get you a&#10;partner, Mr. Bergin. O, that&#39;ll just do now.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Three ladies, Mary Jane,&#34; said Aunt Kate.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The two young gentlemen asked the ladies if they might have the&#10;pleasure, and Mary Jane turned to Miss Daly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O, Miss Daly, you&#39;re really awfully good, after playing for the&#10;last two dances, but really we&#39;re so short of ladies tonight.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I don&#39;t mind in the least, Miss Morkan.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But I&#39;ve a nice partner for you, Mr. Bartell D&#39;Arcy, the tenor.&#10;I&#39;ll get him to sing later on. All Dublin is raving about him.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Lovely voice, lovely voice!&#34; said Aunt Kate.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As the piano had twice begun the prelude to the first figure&#10;Mary Jane led her recruits quickly from the room. They had hardly&#10;gone when Aunt Julia wandered slowly into the room, looking behind&#10;her at something.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What is the matter, Julia?&#34; asked Aunt Kate anxiously. &#34;Who is&#10;it?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Julia, who was carrying in a column of table-napkins, turned to&#10;her sister and said, simply, as if the question had surprised&#10;her:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It&#39;s only Freddy, Kate, and Gabriel with him.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In fact right behind her Gabriel could be seen piloting Freddy&#10;Malins across the landing. The latter, a young man of about forty,&#10;was of Gabriel&#39;s size and build, with very round shoulders. His&#10;face was fleshy and pallid, touched with colour only at the thick&#10;hanging lobes of his ears and at the wide wings of his nose. He had&#10;coarse features, a blunt nose, a convex and receding brow, tumid&#10;and protruded lips. His heavy-lidded eyes and the disorder of his&#10;scanty hair made him look sleepy. He was laughing heartily in a&#10;high key at a story which he had been telling Gabriel on the stairs&#10;and at the same time rubbing the knuckles of his left fist&#10;backwards and forwards into his left eye.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Good-evening, Freddy,&#34; said Aunt Julia.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Freddy Malins bade the Misses Morkan good-evening in what seemed&#10;an offhand fashion by reason of the habitual catch in his voice and&#10;then, seeing that Mr. Browne was grinning at him from the&#10;sideboard, crossed the room on rather shaky legs and began to&#10;repeat in an undertone the story he had just told to Gabriel.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;He&#39;s not so bad, is he?&#34; said Aunt Kate to Gabriel.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Gabriel&#39;s brows were dark but he raised them quickly and&#10;answered:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O, no, hardly noticeable.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Now, isn&#39;t he a terrible fellow!&#34; she said. &#34;And his poor&#10;mother made him take the pledge on New Year&#39;s Eve. But come on,&#10;Gabriel, into the drawing-room.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Before leaving the room with Gabriel she signalled to Mr. Browne&#10;by frowning and shaking her forefinger in warning to and fro. Mr.&#10;Browne nodded in answer and, when she had gone, said to Freddy&#10;Malins:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Now, then, Teddy, I&#39;m going to fill you out a good glass of&#10;lemonade just to buck you up.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Freddy Malins, who was nearing the climax of his story, waved&#10;the offer aside impatiently but Mr. Browne, having first called&#10;Freddy Malins&#39; attention to a disarray in his dress, filled out and&#10;handed him a full glass of lemonade. Freddy Malins&#39; left hand&#10;accepted the glass mechanically, his right hand being engaged in&#10;the mechanical readjustment of his dress. Mr. Browne, whose face&#10;was once more wrinkling with mirth, poured out for himself a glass&#10;of whisky while Freddy Malins exploded, before he had well reached&#10;the climax of his story, in a kink of high-pitched bronchitic&#10;laughter and, setting down his untasted and overflowing glass,&#10;began to rub the knuckles of his left fist backwards and forwards&#10;into his left eye, repeating words of his last phrase as well as&#10;his fit of laughter would allow him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Gabriel could not listen while Mary Jane was playing her Academy&#10;piece, full of runs and difficult passages, to the hushed&#10;drawing-room. He liked music but the piece she was playing had no&#10;melody for him and he doubted whether it had any melody for the&#10;other listeners, though they had begged Mary Jane to play&#10;something. Four young men, who had come from the refreshment-room&#10;to stand in the doorway at the sound of the piano, had gone away&#10;quietly in couples after a few minutes. The only persons who seemed&#10;to follow the music were Mary Jane herself, her hands racing along&#10;the key-board or lifted from it at the pauses like those of a&#10;priestess in momentary imprecation, and Aunt Kate standing at her&#10;elbow to turn the page.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Gabriel&#39;s eyes, irritated by the floor, which glittered with&#10;beeswax under the heavy chandelier, wandered to the wall above the&#10;piano. A picture of the balcony scene in Romeo and Juliet hung&#10;there and beside it was a picture of the two murdered princes in&#10;the Tower which Aunt Julia had worked in red, blue and brown wools&#10;when she was a girl. Probably in the school they had gone to as&#10;girls that kind of work had been taught for one year. His mother&#10;had worked for him as a birthday present a waistcoat of purple&#10;tabinet, with little foxes&#39; heads upon it, lined with brown satin&#10;and having round mulberry buttons. It was strange that his mother&#10;had had no musical talent though Aunt Kate used to call her the&#10;brains carrier of the Morkan family. Both she and Julia had always&#10;seemed a little proud of their serious and matronly sister. Her&#10;photograph stood before the pierglass. She held an open book on her&#10;knees and was pointing out something in it to Constantine who,&#10;dressed in a man-o-war suit, lay at her feet. It was she who had&#10;chosen the name of her sons for she was very sensible of the&#10;dignity of family life. Thanks to her, Constantine was now senior&#10;curate in Balbrigan and, thanks to her, Gabriel himself had taken&#10;his degree in the Royal University. A shadow passed over his face&#10;as he remembered her sullen opposition to his marriage. Some&#10;slighting phrases she had used still rankled in his memory; she had&#10;once spoken of Gretta as being country cute and that was not true&#10;of Gretta at all. It was Gretta who had nursed her during all her&#10;last long illness in their house at Monkstown.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He knew that Mary Jane must be near the end of her piece for she&#10;was playing again the opening melody with runs of scales after&#10;every bar and while he waited for the end the resentment died down&#10;in his heart. The piece ended with a trill of octaves in the treble&#10;and a final deep octave in the bass. Great applause greeted Mary&#10;Jane as, blushing and rolling up her music nervously, she escaped&#10;from the room. The most vigorous clapping came from the four young&#10;men in the doorway who had gone away to the refreshment-room at the&#10;beginning of the piece but had come back when the piano had&#10;stopped.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Lancers were arranged. Gabriel found himself partnered with Miss&#10;Ivors. She was a frank-mannered talkative young lady, with a&#10;freckled face and prominent brown eyes. She did not wear a low-cut&#10;bodice and the large brooch which was fixed in the front of her&#10;collar bore on it an Irish device and motto.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When they had taken their places she said abruptly:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I have a crow to pluck with you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;With me?&#34; said Gabriel.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She nodded her head gravely.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What is it?&#34; asked Gabriel, smiling at her solemn manner.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Who is G. C.?&#34; answered Miss Ivors, turning her eyes upon&#10;him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Gabriel coloured and was about to knit his brows, as if he did&#10;not understand, when she said bluntly:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O, innocent Amy! I have found out that you write for The Daily&#10;Express. Now, aren&#39;t you ashamed of yourself?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why should I be ashamed of myself?&#34; asked Gabriel, blinking his&#10;eyes and trying to smile.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well, I&#39;m ashamed of you,&#34; said Miss Ivors frankly. &#34;To say&#10;you&#39;d write for a paper like that. I didn&#39;t think you were a West&#10;Briton.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A look of perplexity appeared on Gabriel&#39;s face. It was true&#10;that he wrote a literary column every Wednesday in The Daily&#10;Express, for which he was paid fifteen shillings. But that did not&#10;make him a West Briton surely. The books he received for review&#10;were almost more welcome than the paltry cheque. He loved to feel&#10;the covers and turn over the pages of newly printed books. Nearly&#10;every day when his teaching in the college was ended he used to&#10;wander down the quays to the second-hand booksellers, to Hickey&#39;s&#10;on Bachelor&#39;s Walk, to Web&#39;s or Massey&#39;s on Aston&#39;s Quay, or to&#10;O&#39;Clohissey&#39;s in the bystreet. He did not know how to meet her&#10;charge. He wanted to say that literature was above politics. But&#10;they were friends of many years&#39; standing and their careers had&#10;been parallel, first at the University and then as teachers: he&#10;could not risk a grandiose phrase with her. He continued blinking&#10;his eyes and trying to smile and murmured lamely that he saw&#10;nothing political in writing reviews of books.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When their turn to cross had come he was still perplexed and&#10;inattentive. Miss Ivors promptly took his hand in a warm grasp and&#10;said in a soft friendly tone:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Of course, I was only joking. Come, we cross now.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When they were together again she spoke of the University&#10;question and Gabriel felt more at ease. A friend of hers had shown&#10;her his review of Browning&#39;s poems. That was how she had found out&#10;the secret: but she liked the review immensely. Then she said&#10;suddenly:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O, Mr. Conroy, will you come for an excursion to the Aran Isles&#10;this summer? We&#39;re going to stay there a whole month. It will be&#10;splendid out in the Atlantic. You ought to come. Mr. Clancy is&#10;coming, and Mr. Kilkelly and Kathleen Kearney. It would be splendid&#10;for Gretta too if she&#39;d come. She&#39;s from Connacht, isn&#39;t she?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Her people are,&#34; said Gabriel shortly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But you will come, won&#39;t you?&#34; said Miss Ivors, laying her arm&#10;hand eagerly on his arm.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The fact is,&#34; said Gabriel, &#34;I have just arranged to go&#8212;&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Go where?&#34; asked Miss Ivors.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well, you know, every year I go for a cycling tour with some&#10;fellows and so&#8212;&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But where?&#34; asked Miss Ivors.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well, we usually go to France or Belgium or perhaps Germany,&#34;&#10;said Gabriel awkwardly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And why do you go to France and Belgium,&#34; said Miss Ivors,&#10;&#34;instead of visiting your own land?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well,&#34; said Gabriel, &#34;it&#39;s partly to keep in touch with the&#10;languages and partly for a change.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And haven&#39;t you your own language to keep in touch with &#8212;&#10;Irish?&#34; asked Miss Ivors.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well,&#34; said Gabriel, &#34;if it comes to that, you know, Irish is&#10;not my language.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Their neighbours had turned to listen to the cross- examination.&#10;Gabriel glanced right and left nervously and tried to keep his good&#10;humour under the ordeal which was making a blush invade his&#10;forehead.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And haven&#39;t you your own land to visit,&#34; continued Miss Ivors,&#10;&#34;that you know nothing of, your own people, and your own&#10;country?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;0, to tell you the truth,&#34; retorted Gabriel suddenly, &#34;I&#39;m sick&#10;of my own country, sick of it!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why?&#34; asked Miss Ivors.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Gabriel did not answer for his retort had heated him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why?&#34; repeated Miss Ivors.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;They had to go visiting together and, as he had not answered&#10;her, Miss Ivors said warmly:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Of course, you&#39;ve no answer.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Gabriel tried to cover his agitation by taking part in the dance&#10;with great energy. He avoided her eyes for he had seen a sour&#10;expression on her face. But when they met in the long chain he was&#10;surprised to feel his hand firmly pressed. She looked at him from&#10;under her brows for a moment quizzically until he smiled. Then,&#10;just as the chain was about to start again, she stood on tiptoe and&#10;whispered into his ear:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;West Briton!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When the lancers were over Gabriel went away to a remote corner&#10;of the room where Freddy Malins&#39; mother was sitting. She was a&#10;stout feeble old woman with white hair. Her voice had a catch in it&#10;like her son&#39;s and she stuttered slightly. She had been told that&#10;Freddy had come and that he was nearly all right. Gabriel asked her&#10;whether she had had a good crossing. She lived with her married&#10;daughter in Glasgow and came to Dublin on a visit once a year. She&#10;answered placidly that she had had a beautiful crossing and that&#10;the captain had been most attentive to her. She spoke also of the&#10;beautiful house her daughter kept in Glasgow, and of all the&#10;friends they had there. While her tongue rambled on Gabriel tried&#10;to banish from his mind all memory of the unpleasant incident with&#10;Miss Ivors. Of course the girl or woman, or whatever she was, was&#10;an enthusiast but there was a time for all things. Perhaps he ought&#10;not to have answered her like that. But she had no right to call&#10;him a West Briton before people, even in joke. She had tried to&#10;make him ridiculous before people, heckling him and staring at him&#10;with her rabbit&#39;s eyes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He saw his wife making her way towards him through the waltzing&#10;couples. When she reached him she said into his ear:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Gabriel. Aunt Kate wants to know won&#39;t you carve the goose as&#10;usual. Miss Daly will carve the ham and I&#39;ll do the pudding.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;All right,&#34; said Gabriel.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;She&#39;s sending in the younger ones first as soon as this waltz&#10;is over so that we&#39;ll have the table to ourselves.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Were you dancing?&#34; asked Gabriel.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Of course I was. Didn&#39;t you see me? What row had you with Molly&#10;Ivors?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No row. Why? Did she say so?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Something like that. I&#39;m trying to get that Mr. D&#39;Arcy to sing.&#10;He&#39;s full of conceit, I think.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;There was no row,&#34; said Gabriel moodily, &#34;only she wanted me to&#10;go for a trip to the west of Ireland and I said I wouldn&#39;t.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;His wife clasped her hands excitedly and gave a little jump.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O, do go, Gabriel,&#34; she cried. &#34;I&#39;d love to see Galway&#10;again.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You can go if you like,&#34; said Gabriel coldly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She looked at him for a moment, then turned to Mrs. Malins and&#10;said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;There&#39;s a nice husband for you, Mrs. Malins.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;While she was threading her way back across the room Mrs.&#10;Malins, without adverting to the interruption, went on to tell&#10;Gabriel what beautiful places there were in Scotland and beautiful&#10;scenery. Her son-in-law brought them every year to the lakes and&#10;they used to go fishing. Her son-in-law was a splendid fisher. One&#10;day he caught a beautiful big fish and the man in the hotel cooked&#10;it for their dinner.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Gabriel hardly heard what she said. Now that supper was coming&#10;near he began to think again about his speech and about the&#10;quotation. When he saw Freddy Malins coming across the room to&#10;visit his mother Gabriel left the chair free for him and retired&#10;into the embrasure of the window. The room had already cleared and&#10;from the back room came the clatter of plates and knives. Those who&#10;still remained in the drawing room seemed tired of dancing and were&#10;conversing quietly in little groups. Gabriel&#39;s warm trembling&#10;fingers tapped the cold pane of the window. How cool it must be&#10;outside! How pleasant it would be to walk out alone, first along by&#10;the river and then through the park! The snow would be lying on the&#10;branches of the trees and forming a bright cap on the top of the&#10;Wellington Monument. How much more pleasant it would be there than&#10;at the supper-table!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He ran over the headings of his speech: Irish hospitality, sad&#10;memories, the Three Graces, Paris, the quotation from Browning. He&#10;repeated to himself a phrase he had written in his review: &#34;One&#10;feels that one is listening to a thought- tormented music.&#34; Miss&#10;Ivors had praised the review. Was she sincere? Had she really any&#10;life of her own behind all her propagandism? There had never been&#10;any ill-feeling between them until that night. It unnerved him to&#10;think that she would be at the supper-table, looking up at him&#10;while he spoke with her critical quizzing eyes. Perhaps she would&#10;not be sorry to see him fail in his speech. An idea came into his&#10;mind and gave him courage. He would say, alluding to Aunt Kate and&#10;Aunt Julia: &#34;Ladies and Gentlemen, the generation which is now on&#10;the wane among us may have had its faults but for my part I think&#10;it had certain qualities of hospitality, of humour, of humanity,&#10;which the new and very serious and hypereducated generation that is&#10;growing up around us seems to me to lack.&#34; Very good: that was one&#10;for Miss Ivors. What did he care that his aunts were only two&#10;ignorant old women?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A murmur in the room attracted his attention. Mr. Browne was&#10;advancing from the door, gallantly escorting Aunt Julia, who leaned&#10;upon his arm, smiling and hanging her head. An irregular musketry&#10;of applause escorted her also as far as the piano and then, as Mary&#10;Jane seated herself on the stool, and Aunt Julia, no longer&#10;smiling, half turned so as to pitch her voice fairly into the room,&#10;gradually ceased. Gabriel recognised the prelude. It was that of an&#10;old song of Aunt Julia&#39;s &#8212; Arrayed for the Bridal. Her voice,&#10;strong and clear in tone, attacked with great spirit the runs which&#10;embellish the air and though she sang very rapidly she did not miss&#10;even the smallest of the grace notes. To follow the voice, without&#10;looking at the singer&#39;s face, was to feel and share the excitement&#10;of swift and secure flight. Gabriel applauded loudly with all the&#10;others at the close of the song and loud applause was borne in from&#10;the invisible supper-table. It sounded so genuine that a little&#10;colour struggled into Aunt Julia&#39;s face as she bent to replace in&#10;the music-stand the old leather-bound songbook that had her&#10;initials on the cover. Freddy Malins, who had listened with his&#10;head perched sideways to hear her better, was still applauding when&#10;everyone else had ceased and talking animatedly to his mother who&#10;nodded her head gravely and slowly in acquiescence. At last, when&#10;he could clap no more, he stood up suddenly and hurried across the&#10;room to Aunt Julia whose hand he seized and held in both his hands,&#10;shaking it when words failed him or the catch in his voice proved&#10;too much for him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I was just telling my mother,&#34; he said, &#34;I never heard you sing&#10;so well, never. No, I never heard your voice so good as it is&#10;tonight. Now! Would you believe that now? That&#39;s the truth. Upon my&#10;word and honour that&#39;s the truth. I never heard your voice sound so&#10;fresh and so&#8230; so clear and fresh, never.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Aunt Julia smiled broadly and murmured something about&#10;compliments as she released her hand from his grasp. Mr. Browne&#10;extended his open hand towards her and said to those who were near&#10;him in the manner of a showman introducing a prodigy to an&#10;audience:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Miss Julia Morkan, my latest discovery!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He was laughing very heartily at this himself when Freddy Malins&#10;turned to him and said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well, Browne, if you&#39;re serious you might make a worse&#10;discovery. All I can say is I never heard her sing half so well as&#10;long as I am coming here. And that&#39;s the honest truth.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Neither did I,&#34; said Mr. Browne. &#34;I think her voice has greatly&#10;improved.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Aunt Julia shrugged her shoulders and said with meek pride:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Thirty years ago I hadn&#39;t a bad voice as voices go.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I often told Julia,&#34; said Aunt Kate emphatically, &#34;that she was&#10;simply thrown away in that choir. But she never would be said by&#10;me.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She turned as if to appeal to the good sense of the others&#10;against a refractory child while Aunt Julia gazed in front of her,&#10;a vague smile of reminiscence playing on her face.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No,&#34; continued Aunt Kate, &#34;she wouldn&#39;t be said or led by&#10;anyone, slaving there in that choir night and day, night and day.&#10;Six o&#39;clock on Christmas morning! And all for what?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well, isn&#39;t it for the honour of God, Aunt Kate?&#34; asked Mary&#10;Jane, twisting round on the piano-stool and smiling.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Aunt Kate turned fiercely on her niece and said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I know all about the honour of God, Mary Jane, but I think it&#39;s&#10;not at all honourable for the pope to turn out the women out of the&#10;choirs that have slaved there all their lives and put little&#10;whipper-snappers of boys over their heads. I suppose it is for the&#10;good of the Church if the pope does it. But it&#39;s not just, Mary&#10;Jane, and it&#39;s not right.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She had worked herself into a passion and would have continued&#10;in defence of her sister for it was a sore subject with her but&#10;Mary Jane, seeing that all the dancers had come back, intervened&#10;pacifically:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Now, Aunt Kate, you&#39;re giving scandal to Mr. Browne who is of&#10;the other persuasion.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Aunt Kate turned to Mr. Browne, who was grinning at this&#10;allusion to his religion, and said hastily:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O, I don&#39;t question the pope&#39;s being right. I&#39;m only a stupid&#10;old woman and I wouldn&#39;t presume to do such a thing. But there&#39;s&#10;such a thing as common everyday politeness and gratitude. And if I&#10;were in Julia&#39;s place I&#39;d tell that Father Healey straight up to&#10;his face&#8230; &#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And besides, Aunt Kate,&#34; said Mary Jane, &#34;we really are all&#10;hungry and when we are hungry we are all very quarrelsome.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And when we are thirsty we are also quarrelsome,&#34; added Mr.&#10;Browne.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;So that we had better go to supper,&#34; said Mary Jane, &#34;and&#10;finish the discussion afterwards.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;On the landing outside the drawing-room Gabriel found his wife&#10;and Mary Jane trying to persuade Miss Ivors to stay for supper. But&#10;Miss Ivors, who had put on her hat and was buttoning her cloak,&#10;would not stay. She did not feel in the least hungry and she had&#10;already overstayed her time.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But only for ten minutes, Molly,&#34; said Mrs. Conroy. &#34;That won&#39;t&#10;delay you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;To take a pick itself,&#34; said Mary Jane, &#34;after all your&#10;dancing.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I really couldn&#39;t,&#34; said Miss Ivors.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I am afraid you didn&#39;t enjoy yourself at all,&#34; said Mary Jane&#10;hopelessly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ever so much, I assure you,&#34; said Miss Ivors, &#34;but you really&#10;must let me run off now.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But how can you get home?&#34; asked Mrs. Conroy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O, it&#39;s only two steps up the quay.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Gabriel hesitated a moment and said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;If you will allow me, Miss Ivors, I&#39;ll see you home if you are&#10;really obliged to go.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But Miss Ivors broke away from them.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I won&#39;t hear of it,&#34; she cried. &#34;For goodness&#39; sake go in to&#10;your suppers and don&#39;t mind me. I&#39;m quite well able to take care of&#10;myself.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well, you&#39;re the comical girl, Molly,&#34; said Mrs. Conroy&#10;frankly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Beannacht libh,&#34; cried Miss Ivors, with a laugh, as she ran&#10;down the staircase.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mary Jane gazed after her, a moody puzzled expression on her&#10;face, while Mrs. Conroy leaned over the banisters to listen for the&#10;hall-door. Gabriel asked himself was he the cause of her abrupt&#10;departure. But she did not seem to be in ill humour: she had gone&#10;away laughing. He stared blankly down the staircase.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At the moment Aunt Kate came toddling out of the supper-room,&#10;almost wringing her hands in despair.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Where is Gabriel?&#34; she cried. &#34;Where on earth is Gabriel?&#10;There&#39;s everyone waiting in there, stage to let, and nobody to&#10;carve the goose!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Here I am, Aunt Kate!&#34; cried Gabriel, with sudden animation,&#10;&#34;ready to carve a flock of geese, if necessary.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A fat brown goose lay at one end of the table and at the other&#10;end, on a bed of creased paper strewn with sprigs of parsley, lay a&#10;great ham, stripped of its outer skin and peppered over with crust&#10;crumbs, a neat paper frill round its shin and beside this was a&#10;round of spiced beef. Between these rival ends ran parallel lines&#10;of side-dishes: two little minsters of jelly, red and yellow; a&#10;shallow dish full of blocks of blancmange and red jam, a large&#10;green leaf-shaped dish with a stalk-shaped handle, on which lay&#10;bunches of purple raisins and peeled almonds, a companion dish on&#10;which lay a solid rectangle of Smyrna figs, a dish of custard&#10;topped with grated nutmeg, a small bowl full of chocolates and&#10;sweets wrapped in gold and silver papers and a glass vase in which&#10;stood some tall celery stalks. In the centre of the table there&#10;stood, as sentries to a fruit-stand which upheld a pyramid of&#10;oranges and American apples, two squat old-fashioned decanters of&#10;cut glass, one containing port and the other dark sherry. On the&#10;closed square piano a pudding in a huge yellow dish lay in waiting&#10;and behind it were three squads of bottles of stout and ale and&#10;minerals, drawn up according to the colours of their uniforms, the&#10;first two black, with brown and red labels, the third and smallest&#10;squad white, with transverse green sashes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Gabriel took his seat boldly at the head of the table and,&#10;having looked to the edge of the carver, plunged his fork firmly&#10;into the goose. He felt quite at ease now for he was an expert&#10;carver and liked nothing better than to find himself at the head of&#10;a well-laden table.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Miss Furlong, what shall I send you?&#34; he asked. &#34;A wing or a&#10;slice of the breast?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Just a small slice of the breast.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Miss Higgins, what for you?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O, anything at all, Mr. Conroy.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;While Gabriel and Miss Daly exchanged plates of goose and plates&#10;of ham and spiced beef Lily went from guest to guest with a dish of&#10;hot floury potatoes wrapped in a white napkin. This was Mary Jane&#39;s&#10;idea and she had also suggested apple sauce for the goose but Aunt&#10;Kate had said that plain roast goose without any apple sauce had&#10;always been good enough for her and she hoped she might never eat&#10;worse. Mary Jane waited on her pupils and saw that they got the&#10;best slices and Aunt Kate and Aunt Julia opened and carried across&#10;from the piano bottles of stout and ale for the gentlemen and&#10;bottles of minerals for the ladies. There was a great deal of&#10;confusion and laughter and noise, the noise of orders and&#10;counter-orders, of knives and forks, of corks and glass-stoppers.&#10;Gabriel began to carve second helpings as soon as he had finished&#10;the first round without serving himself. Everyone protested loudly&#10;so that he compromised by taking a long draught of stout for he had&#10;found the carving hot work. Mary Jane settled down quietly to her&#10;supper but Aunt Kate and Aunt Julia were still toddling round the&#10;table, walking on each other&#39;s heels, getting in each other&#39;s way&#10;and giving each other unheeded orders. Mr. Browne begged of them to&#10;sit down and eat their suppers and so did Gabriel but they said&#10;there was time enough, so that, at last, Freddy Malins stood up&#10;and, capturing Aunt Kate, plumped her down on her chair amid&#10;general laughter.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When everyone had been well served Gabriel said, smiling:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Now, if anyone wants a little more of what vulgar people call&#10;stuffing let him or her speak.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A chorus of voices invited him to begin his own supper and Lily&#10;came forward with three potatoes which she had reserved for&#10;him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Very well,&#34; said Gabriel amiably, as he took another&#10;preparatory draught, &#34;kindly forget my existence, ladies and&#10;gentlemen, for a few minutes.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He set to his supper and took no part in the conversation with&#10;which the table covered Lily&#39;s removal of the plates. The subject&#10;of talk was the opera company which was then at the Theatre Royal.&#10;Mr. Bartell D&#39;Arcy, the tenor, a dark- complexioned young man with&#10;a smart moustache, praised very highly the leading contralto of the&#10;company but Miss Furlong thought she had a rather vulgar style of&#10;production. Freddy Malins said there was a Negro chieftain singing&#10;in the second part of the Gaiety pantomime who had one of the&#10;finest tenor voices he had ever heard.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Have you heard him?&#34; he asked Mr. Bartell D&#39;Arcy across the&#10;table.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No,&#34; answered Mr. Bartell D&#39;Arcy carelessly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Because,&#34; Freddy Malins explained, &#34;now I&#39;d be curious to hear&#10;your opinion of him. I think he has a grand voice.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It takes Teddy to find out the really good things,&#34; said Mr.&#10;Browne familiarly to the table.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And why couldn&#39;t he have a voice too?&#34; asked Freddy Malins&#10;sharply. &#34;Is it because he&#39;s only a black?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Nobody answered this question and Mary Jane led the table back&#10;to the legitimate opera. One of her pupils had given her a pass for&#10;Mignon. Of course it was very fine, she said, but it made her think&#10;of poor Georgina Burns. Mr. Browne could go back farther still, to&#10;the old Italian companies that used to come to Dublin &#8212; Tietjens,&#10;Ilma de Murzka, Campanini, the great Trebelli, Giuglini, Ravelli,&#10;Aramburo. Those were the days, he said, when there was something&#10;like singing to be heard in Dublin. He told too of how the top&#10;gallery of the old Royal used to be packed night after night, of&#10;how one night an Italian tenor had sung five encores to Let me like&#10;a Soldier fall, introducing a high C every time, and of how the&#10;gallery boys would sometimes in their enthusiasm unyoke the horses&#10;from the carriage of some great prima donna and pull her themselves&#10;through the streets to her hotel. Why did they never play the grand&#10;old operas now, he asked, Dinorah, Lucrezia Borgia? Because they&#10;could not get the voices to sing them: that was why.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh, well,&#34; said Mr. Bartell D&#39;Arcy, &#34;I presume there are as&#10;good singers today as there were then.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Where are they?&#34; asked Mr. Browne defiantly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;In London, Paris, Milan,&#34; said Mr. Bartell D&#39;Arcy warmly. &#34;I&#10;suppose Caruso, for example, is quite as good, if not better than&#10;any of the men you have mentioned.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Maybe so,&#34; said Mr. Browne. &#34;But I may tell you I doubt it&#10;strongly.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O, I&#39;d give anything to hear Caruso sing,&#34; said Mary Jane.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;For me,&#34; said Aunt Kate, who had been picking a bone, &#34;there&#10;was only one tenor. To please me, I mean. But I suppose none of you&#10;ever heard of him.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Who was he, Miss Morkan?&#34; asked Mr. Bartell D&#39;Arcy&#10;politely.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;His name,&#34; said Aunt Kate, &#34;was Parkinson. I heard him when he&#10;was in his prime and I think he had then the purest tenor voice&#10;that was ever put into a man&#39;s throat.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Strange,&#34; said Mr. Bartell D&#39;Arcy. &#34;I never even heard of&#10;him.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, yes, Miss Morkan is right,&#34; said Mr. Browne. &#34;I remember&#10;hearing of old Parkinson but he&#39;s too far back for me.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;A beautiful, pure, sweet, mellow English tenor,&#34; said Aunt Kate&#10;with enthusiasm.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Gabriel having finished, the huge pudding was transferred to the&#10;table. The clatter of forks and spoons began again. Gabriel&#39;s wife&#10;served out spoonfuls of the pudding and passed the plates down the&#10;table. Midway down they were held up by Mary Jane, who replenished&#10;them with raspberry or orange jelly or with blancmange and jam. The&#10;pudding was of Aunt Julia&#39;s making and she received praises for it&#10;from all quarters She herself said that it was not quite brown&#10;enough.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well, I hope, Miss Morkan,&#34; said Mr. Browne, &#34;that I&#39;m brown&#10;enough for you because, you know, I&#39;m all brown.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;All the gentlemen, except Gabriel, ate some of the pudding out&#10;of compliment to Aunt Julia. As Gabriel never ate sweets the celery&#10;had been left for him. Freddy Malins also took a stalk of celery&#10;and ate it with his pudding. He had been told that celery was a&#10;capital thing for the blood and he was just then under doctor&#39;s&#10;care. Mrs. Malins, who had been silent all through the supper, said&#10;that her son was going down to Mount Melleray in a week or so. The&#10;table then spoke of Mount Melleray, how bracing the air was down&#10;there, how hospitable the monks were and how they never asked for a&#10;penny-piece from their guests.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And do you mean to say,&#34; asked Mr. Browne incredulously, &#34;that&#10;a chap can go down there and put up there as if it were a hotel and&#10;live on the fat of the land and then come away without paying&#10;anything?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O, most people give some donation to the monastery when they&#10;leave.&#34; said Mary Jane.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I wish we had an institution like that in our Church,&#34; said Mr.&#10;Browne candidly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He was astonished to hear that the monks never spoke, got up at&#10;two in the morning and slept in their coffins. He asked what they&#10;did it for.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That&#39;s the rule of the order,&#34; said Aunt Kate firmly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, but why?&#34; asked Mr. Browne.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Aunt Kate repeated that it was the rule, that was all. Mr.&#10;Browne still seemed not to understand. Freddy Malins explained to&#10;him, as best he could, that the monks were trying to make up for&#10;the sins committed by all the sinners in the outside world. The&#10;explanation was not very clear for Mr. Browne grinned and said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I like that idea very much but wouldn&#39;t a comfortable spring&#10;bed do them as well as a coffin?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The coffin,&#34; said Mary Jane, &#34;is to remind them of their last&#10;end.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As the subject had grown lugubrious it was buried in a silence&#10;of the table during which Mrs. Malins could be heard saying to her&#10;neighbour in an indistinct undertone:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;They are very good men, the monks, very pious men.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The raisins and almonds and figs and apples and oranges and&#10;chocolates and sweets were now passed about the table and Aunt&#10;Julia invited all the guests to have either port or sherry. At&#10;first Mr. Bartell D&#39;Arcy refused to take either but one of his&#10;neighbours nudged him and whispered something to him upon which he&#10;allowed his glass to be filled. Gradually as the last glasses were&#10;being filled the conversation ceased. A pause followed, broken only&#10;by the noise of the wine and by unsettlings of chairs. The Misses&#10;Morkan, all three, looked down at the tablecloth. Someone coughed&#10;once or twice and then a few gentlemen patted the table gently as a&#10;signal for silence. The silence came and Gabriel pushed back his&#10;chair&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The patting at once grew louder in encouragement and then ceased&#10;altogether. Gabriel leaned his ten trembling fingers on the&#10;tablecloth and smiled nervously at the company. Meeting a row of&#10;upturned faces he raised his eyes to the chandelier. The piano was&#10;playing a waltz tune and he could hear the skirts sweeping against&#10;the drawing-room door. People, perhaps, were standing in the snow&#10;on the quay outside, gazing up at the lighted windows and listening&#10;to the waltz music. The air was pure there. In the distance lay the&#10;park where the trees were weighted with snow. The Wellington&#10;Monument wore a gleaming cap of snow that flashed westward over the&#10;white field of Fifteen Acres.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He began:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ladies and Gentlemen,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It has fallen to my lot this evening, as in years past, to&#10;perform a very pleasing task but a task for which I am afraid my&#10;poor powers as a speaker are all too inadequate.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No, no!&#34; said Mr. Browne.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But, however that may be, I can only ask you tonight to take&#10;the will for the deed and to lend me your attention for a few&#10;moments while I endeavour to express to you in words what my&#10;feelings are on this occasion.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ladies and Gentlemen, it is not the first time that we have&#10;gathered together under this hospitable roof, around this&#10;hospitable board. It is not the first time that we have been the&#10;recipients &#8212; or perhaps, I had better say, the victims &#8212; of the&#10;hospitality of certain good ladies.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He made a circle in the air with his arm and paused. Everyone&#10;laughed or smiled at Aunt Kate and Aunt Julia and Mary Jane who all&#10;turned crimson with pleasure. Gabriel went on more boldly:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I feel more strongly with every recurring year that our country&#10;has no tradition which does it so much honour and which it should&#10;guard so jealously as that of its hospitality. It is a tradition&#10;that is unique as far as my experience goes (and I have visited not&#10;a few places abroad) among the modern nations. Some would say,&#10;perhaps, that with us it is rather a failing than anything to be&#10;boasted of. But granted even that, it is, to my mind, a princely&#10;failing, and one that I trust will long be cultivated among us. Of&#10;one thing, at least, I am sure. As long as this one roof shelters&#10;the good ladies aforesaid &#8212; and I wish from my heart it may do so&#10;for many and many a long year to come &#8212; the tradition of genuine&#10;warm-hearted courteous Irish hospitality, which our forefathers&#10;have handed down to us and which we in turn must hand down to our&#10;descendants, is still alive among us.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A hearty murmur of assent ran round the table. It shot through&#10;Gabriel&#39;s mind that Miss Ivors was not there and that she had gone&#10;away discourteously: and he said with confidence in himself:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ladies and Gentlemen,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;A new generation is growing up in our midst, a generation&#10;actuated by new ideas and new principles. It is serious and&#10;enthusiastic for these new ideas and its enthusiasm, even when it&#10;is misdirected, is, I believe, in the main sincere. But we are&#10;living in a sceptical and, if I may use the phrase, a&#10;thought-tormented age: and sometimes I fear that this new&#10;generation, educated or hypereducated as it is, will lack those&#10;qualities of humanity, of hospitality, of kindly humour which&#10;belonged to an older day. Listening tonight to the names of all&#10;those great singers of the past it seemed to me, I must confess,&#10;that we were living in a less spacious age. Those days might,&#10;without exaggeration, be called spacious days: and if they are gone&#10;beyond recall let us hope, at least, that in gatherings such as&#10;this we shall still speak of them with pride and affection, still&#10;cherish in our hearts the memory of those dead and gone great ones&#10;whose fame the world will not willingly let die.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Hear, hear!&#34; said Mr. Browne loudly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But yet,&#34; continued Gabriel, his voice falling into a softer&#10;inflection, &#34;there are always in gatherings such as this sadder&#10;thoughts that will recur to our minds: thoughts of the past, of&#10;youth, of changes, of absent faces that we miss here tonight. Our&#10;path through life is strewn with many such sad memories: and were&#10;we to brood upon them always we could not find the heart to go on&#10;bravely with our work among the living. We have all of us living&#10;duties and living affections which claim, and rightly claim, our&#10;strenuous endeavours.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Therefore, I will not linger on the past. I will not let any&#10;gloomy moralising intrude upon us here tonight. Here we are&#10;gathered together for a brief moment from the bustle and rush of&#10;our everyday routine. We are met here as friends, in the spirit of&#10;good-fellowship, as colleagues, also to a certain extent, in the&#10;true spirit of camaraderie, and as the guests of &#8212; what shall I&#10;call them? &#8212; the Three Graces of the Dublin musical world.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The table burst into applause and laughter at this allusion.&#10;Aunt Julia vainly asked each of her neighbours in turn to tell her&#10;what Gabriel had said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;He says we are the Three Graces, Aunt Julia,&#34; said Mary&#10;Jane.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Aunt Julia did not understand but she looked up, smiling, at&#10;Gabriel, who continued in the same vein:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ladies and Gentlemen,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I will not attempt to play tonight the part that Paris played&#10;on another occasion. I will not attempt to choose between them. The&#10;task would be an invidious one and one beyond my poor powers. For&#10;when I view them in turn, whether it be our chief hostess herself,&#10;whose good heart, whose too good heart, has become a byword with&#10;all who know her, or her sister, who seems to be gifted with&#10;perennial youth and whose singing must have been a surprise and a&#10;revelation to us all tonight, or, last but not least, when I&#10;consider our youngest hostess, talented, cheerful, hard-working and&#10;the best of nieces, I confess, Ladies and Gentlemen, that I do not&#10;know to which of them I should award the prize.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Gabriel glanced down at his aunts and, seeing the large smile on&#10;Aunt Julia&#39;s face and the tears which had risen to Aunt Kate&#39;s&#10;eyes, hastened to his close. He raised his glass of port gallantly,&#10;while every member of the company fingered a glass expectantly, and&#10;said loudly:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Let us toast them all three together. Let us drink to their&#10;health, wealth, long life, happiness and prosperity and may they&#10;long continue to hold the proud and self-won position which they&#10;hold in their profession and the position of honour and affection&#10;which they hold in our hearts.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;All the guests stood up, glass in hand, and turning towards the&#10;three seated ladies, sang in unison, with Mr. Browne as leader:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For they are jolly gay fellows, For they are jolly gay fellows,&#10;For they are jolly gay fellows, Which nobody can deny.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Aunt Kate was making frank use of her handkerchief and even Aunt&#10;Julia seemed moved. Freddy Malins beat time with his pudding-fork&#10;and the singers turned towards one another, as if in melodious&#10;conference, while they sang with emphasis:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Unless he tells a lie, Unless he tells a lie,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then, turning once more towards their hostesses, they sang:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For they are jolly gay fellows, For they are jolly gay fellows,&#10;For they are jolly gay fellows, Which nobody can deny.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The acclamation which followed was taken up beyond the door of&#10;the supper-room by many of the other guests and renewed time after&#10;time, Freddy Malins acting as officer with his fork on high.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The piercing morning air came into the hall where they were&#10;standing so that Aunt Kate said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Close the door, somebody. Mrs. Malins will get her death of&#10;cold.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Browne is out there, Aunt Kate,&#34; said Mary Jane.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Browne is everywhere,&#34; said Aunt Kate, lowering her voice.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mary Jane laughed at her tone.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Really,&#34; she said archly, &#34;he is very attentive.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;He has been laid on here like the gas,&#34; said Aunt Kate in the&#10;same tone, &#34;all during the Christmas.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She laughed herself this time good-humouredly and then added&#10;quickly:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But tell him to come in, Mary Jane, and close the door. I hope&#10;to goodness he didn&#39;t hear me.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At that moment the hall-door was opened and Mr. Browne came in&#10;from the doorstep, laughing as if his heart would break. He was&#10;dressed in a long green overcoat with mock astrakhan cuffs and&#10;collar and wore on his head an oval fur cap. He pointed down the&#10;snow-covered quay from where the sound of shrill prolonged&#10;whistling was borne in.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Teddy will have all the cabs in Dublin out,&#34; he said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Gabriel advanced from the little pantry behind the office,&#10;struggling into his overcoat and, looking round the hall, said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Gretta not down yet?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;She&#39;s getting on her things, Gabriel,&#34; said Aunt Kate.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Who&#39;s playing up there?&#34; asked Gabriel.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Nobody. They&#39;re all gone.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O no, Aunt Kate,&#34; said Mary Jane. &#34;Bartell D&#39;Arcy and Miss&#10;O&#39;Callaghan aren&#39;t gone yet.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Someone is fooling at the piano anyhow,&#34; said Gabriel.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mary Jane glanced at Gabriel and Mr. Browne and said with a&#10;shiver:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It makes me feel cold to look at you two gentlemen muffled up&#10;like that. I wouldn&#39;t like to face your journey home at this&#10;hour.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I&#39;d like nothing better this minute,&#34; said Mr. Browne stoutly,&#10;&#34;than a rattling fine walk in the country or a fast drive with a&#10;good spanking goer between the shafts.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;We used to have a very good horse and trap at home,&#34; said Aunt&#10;Julia sadly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The never-to-be-forgotten Johnny,&#34; said Mary Jane,&#10;laughing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Aunt Kate and Gabriel laughed too.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why, what was wonderful about Johnny?&#34; asked Mr. Browne.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The late lamented Patrick Morkan, our grandfather, that is,&#34;&#10;explained Gabriel, &#34;commonly known in his later years as the old&#10;gentleman, was a glue-boiler.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O, now, Gabriel,&#34; said Aunt Kate, laughing, &#34;he had a starch&#10;mill.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well, glue or starch,&#34; said Gabriel, &#34;the old gentleman had a&#10;horse by the name of Johnny. And Johnny used to work in the old&#10;gentleman&#39;s mill, walking round and round in order to drive the&#10;mill. That was all very well; but now comes the tragic part about&#10;Johnny. One fine day the old gentleman thought he&#39;d like to drive&#10;out with the quality to a military review in the park.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The Lord have mercy on his soul,&#34; said Aunt Kate&#10;compassionately.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Amen,&#34; said Gabriel. &#34;So the old gentleman, as I said,&#10;harnessed Johnny and put on his very best tall hat and his very&#10;best stock collar and drove out in grand style from his ancestral&#10;mansion somewhere near Back Lane, I think.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Everyone laughed, even Mrs. Malins, at Gabriel&#39;s manner and Aunt&#10;Kate said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O, now, Gabriel, he didn&#39;t live in Back Lane, really. Only the&#10;mill was there.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Out from the mansion of his forefathers,&#34; continued Gabriel,&#10;&#34;he drove with Johnny. And everything went on beautifully until&#10;Johnny came in sight of King Billy&#39;s statue: and whether he fell in&#10;love with the horse King Billy sits on or whether he thought he was&#10;back again in the mill, anyhow he began to walk round the&#10;statue.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Gabriel paced in a circle round the hall in his goloshes amid&#10;the laughter of the others.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Round and round he went,&#34; said Gabriel, &#34;and the old gentleman,&#10;who was a very pompous old gentleman, was highly indignant. &#39;Go on,&#10;sir! What do you mean, sir? Johnny! Johnny! Most extraordinary&#10;conduct! Can&#39;t understand the horse!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The peal of laughter which followed Gabriel&#39;s imitation of the&#10;incident was interrupted by a resounding knock at the hall door.&#10;Mary Jane ran to open it and let in Freddy Malins. Freddy Malins,&#10;with his hat well back on his head and his shoulders humped with&#10;cold, was puffing and steaming after his exertions.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I could only get one cab,&#34; he said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O, we&#39;ll find another along the quay,&#34; said Gabriel.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes,&#34; said Aunt Kate. &#34;Better not keep Mrs. Malins standing in&#10;the draught.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mrs. Malins was helped down the front steps by her son and Mr.&#10;Browne and, after many manoeuvres, hoisted into the cab. Freddy&#10;Malins clambered in after her and spent a long time settling her on&#10;the seat, Mr. Browne helping him with advice. At last she was&#10;settled comfortably and Freddy Malins invited Mr. Browne into the&#10;cab. There was a good deal of confused talk, and then Mr. Browne&#10;got into the cab. The cabman settled his rug over his knees, and&#10;bent down for the address. The confusion grew greater and the&#10;cabman was directed differently by Freddy Malins and Mr. Browne,&#10;each of whom had his head out through a window of the cab. The&#10;difficulty was to know where to drop Mr. Browne along the route,&#10;and Aunt Kate, Aunt Julia and Mary Jane helped the discussion from&#10;the doorstep with cross-directions and contradictions and abundance&#10;of laughter. As for Freddy Malins he was speechless with laughter.&#10;He popped his head in and out of the window every moment to the&#10;great danger of his hat, and told his mother how the discussion was&#10;progressing, till at last Mr. Browne shouted to the bewildered&#10;cabman above the din of everybody&#39;s laughter:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Do you know Trinity College?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, sir,&#34; said the cabman.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well, drive bang up against Trinity College gates,&#34; said Mr.&#10;Browne, &#34;and then we&#39;ll tell you where to go. You understand&#10;now?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, sir,&#34; said the cabman.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Make like a bird for Trinity College.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Right, sir,&#34; said the cabman.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The horse was whipped up and the cab rattled off along the quay&#10;amid a chorus of laughter and adieus.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Gabriel had not gone to the door with the others. He was in a&#10;dark part of the hall gazing up the staircase. A woman was standing&#10;near the top of the first flight, in the shadow also. He could not&#10;see her face but he could see the terra-cotta and salmon-pink&#10;panels of her skirt which the shadow made appear black and white.&#10;It was his wife. She was leaning on the banisters, listening to&#10;something. Gabriel was surprised at her stillness and strained his&#10;ear to listen also. But he could hear little save the noise of&#10;laughter and dispute on the front steps, a few chords struck on the&#10;piano and a few notes of a man&#39;s voice singing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He stood still in the gloom of the hall, trying to catch the air&#10;that the voice was singing and gazing up at his wife. There was&#10;grace and mystery in her attitude as if she were a symbol of&#10;something. He asked himself what is a woman standing on the stairs&#10;in the shadow, listening to distant music, a symbol of. If he were&#10;a painter he would paint her in that attitude. Her blue felt hat&#10;would show off the bronze of her hair against the darkness and the&#10;dark panels of her skirt would show off the light ones. Distant&#10;Music he would call the picture if he were a painter.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The hall-door was closed; and Aunt Kate, Aunt Julia and Mary&#10;Jane came down the hall, still laughing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well, isn&#39;t Freddy terrible?&#34; said Mary Jane. &#34;He&#39;s really&#10;terrible.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Gabriel said nothing but pointed up the stairs towards where his&#10;wife was standing. Now that the hall-door was closed the voice and&#10;the piano could be heard more clearly. Gabriel held up his hand for&#10;them to be silent. The song seemed to be in the old Irish tonality&#10;and the singer seemed uncertain both of his words and of his voice.&#10;The voice, made plaintive by distance and by the singer&#39;s&#10;hoarseness, faintly illuminated the cadence of the air with words&#10;expressing grief:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;O, the rain falls on my heavy locks And the dew wets my skin, My&#10;babe lies cold&#8230;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O,&#34; exclaimed Mary Jane. &#34;It&#39;s Bartell D&#39;Arcy singing and he&#10;wouldn&#39;t sing all the night. O, I&#39;ll get him to sing a song before&#10;he goes.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O, do, Mary Jane,&#34; said Aunt Kate.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mary Jane brushed past the others and ran to the staircase, but&#10;before she reached it the singing stopped and the piano was closed&#10;abruptly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O, what a pity!&#34; she cried. &#34;Is he coming down, Gretta?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Gabriel heard his wife answer yes and saw her come down towards&#10;them. A few steps behind her were Mr. Bartell D&#39;Arcy and Miss&#10;O&#39;Callaghan.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O, Mr. D&#39;Arcy,&#34; cried Mary Jane, &#34;it&#39;s downright mean of you to&#10;break off like that when we were all in raptures listening to&#10;you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I have been at him all the evening,&#34; said Miss O&#39;Callaghan,&#10;&#34;and Mrs. Conroy, too, and he told us he had a dreadful cold and&#10;couldn&#39;t sing.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O, Mr. D&#39;Arcy,&#34; said Aunt Kate, &#34;now that was a great fib to&#10;tell.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Can&#39;t you see that I&#39;m as hoarse as a crow?&#34; said Mr. D&#39;Arcy&#10;roughly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He went into the pantry hastily and put on his overcoat. The&#10;others, taken aback by his rude speech, could find nothing to say.&#10;Aunt Kate wrinkled her brows and made signs to the others to drop&#10;the subject. Mr. D&#39;Arcy stood swathing his neck carefully and&#10;frowning.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It&#39;s the weather,&#34; said Aunt Julia, after a pause.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, everybody has colds,&#34; said Aunt Kate readily,&#10;&#34;everybody.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;They say,&#34; said Mary Jane, &#34;we haven&#39;t had snow like it for&#10;thirty years; and I read this morning in the newspapers that the&#10;snow is general all over Ireland.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I love the look of snow,&#34; said Aunt Julia sadly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;So do I,&#34; said Miss O&#39;Callaghan. &#34;I think Christmas is never&#10;really Christmas unless we have the snow on the ground.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But poor Mr. D&#39;Arcy doesn&#39;t like the snow,&#34; said Aunt Kate,&#10;smiling.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. D&#39;Arcy came from the pantry, fully swathed and buttoned, and&#10;in a repentant tone told them the history of his cold. Everyone&#10;gave him advice and said it was a great pity and urged him to be&#10;very careful of his throat in the night air. Gabriel watched his&#10;wife, who did not join in the conversation. She was standing right&#10;under the dusty fanlight and the flame of the gas lit up the rich&#10;bronze of her hair, which he had seen her drying at the fire a few&#10;days before. She was in the same attitude and seemed unaware of the&#10;talk about her At last she turned towards them and Gabriel saw that&#10;there was colour on her cheeks and that her eyes were shining. A&#10;sudden tide of joy went leaping out of his heart.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Mr. D&#39;Arcy,&#34; she said, &#34;what is the name of that song you were&#10;singing?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It&#39;s called The Lass of Aughrim,&#34; said Mr. D&#39;Arcy, &#34;but I&#10;couldn&#39;t remember it properly. Why? Do you know it?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The Lass of Aughrim,&#34; she repeated. &#34;I couldn&#39;t think of the&#10;name.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It&#39;s a very nice air,&#34; said Mary Jane. &#34;I&#39;m sorry you were not&#10;in voice tonight.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Now, Mary Jane,&#34; said Aunt Kate, &#34;don&#39;t annoy Mr. D&#39;Arcy. I&#10;won&#39;t have him annoyed.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Seeing that all were ready to start she shepherded them to the&#10;door, where good-night was said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well, good-night, Aunt Kate, and thanks for the pleasant&#10;evening.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Good-night, Gabriel. Good-night, Gretta!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Good-night, Aunt Kate, and thanks ever so much. Goodnight, Aunt&#10;Julia.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O, good-night, Gretta, I didn&#39;t see you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Good-night, Mr. D&#39;Arcy. Good-night, Miss O&#39;Callaghan.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Good-night, Miss Morkan.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Good-night, again.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Good-night, all. Safe home.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Good-night. Good night.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The morning was still dark. A dull, yellow light brooded over&#10;the houses and the river; and the sky seemed to be descending. It&#10;was slushy underfoot; and only streaks and patches of snow lay on&#10;the roofs, on the parapets of the quay and on the area railings.&#10;The lamps were still burning redly in the murky air and, across the&#10;river, the palace of the Four Courts stood out menacingly against&#10;the heavy sky.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She was walking on before him with Mr. Bartell D&#39;Arcy, her shoes&#10;in a brown parcel tucked under one arm and her hands holding her&#10;skirt up from the slush. She had no longer any grace of attitude,&#10;but Gabriel&#39;s eyes were still bright with happiness. The blood went&#10;bounding along his veins; and the thoughts went rioting through his&#10;brain, proud, joyful, tender, valorous.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She was walking on before him so lightly and so erect that he&#10;longed to run after her noiselessly, catch her by the shoulders and&#10;say something foolish and affectionate into her ear. She seemed to&#10;him so frail that he longed to defend her against something and&#10;then to be alone with her. Moments of their secret life together&#10;burst like stars upon his memory. A heliotrope envelope was lying&#10;beside his breakfast-cup and he was caressing it with his hand.&#10;Birds were twittering in the ivy and the sunny web of the curtain&#10;was shimmering along the floor: he could not eat for happiness.&#10;They were standing on the crowded platform and he was placing a&#10;ticket inside the warm palm of her glove. He was standing with her&#10;in the cold, looking in through a grated window at a man making&#10;bottles in a roaring furnace. It was very cold. Her face, fragrant&#10;in the cold air, was quite close to his; and suddenly he called out&#10;to the man at the furnace:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Is the fire hot, sir?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But the man could not hear with the noise of the furnace. It was&#10;just as well. He might have answered rudely.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A wave of yet more tender joy escaped from his heart and went&#10;coursing in warm flood along his arteries. Like the tender fire of&#10;stars moments of their life together, that no one knew f or would&#10;ever know of, broke upon and illumined his memory. He longed to&#10;recall to her those moments, to make her forget the years of their&#10;dull existence together and remember only their moments of ecstasy.&#10;For the years, he felt, had not quenched his soul or hers. Their&#10;children, his writing, her household cares had not quenched all&#10;their souls&#39; tender fire. In one letter that he had written to her&#10;then he had said: &#34;Why is it that words like these seem to me so&#10;dull and cold? Is it because there is no word tender enough to be&#10;your name?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Like distant music these words that he had written years before&#10;were borne towards him from the past. He longed to be alone with&#10;her. When the others had gone away, when he and she were in the&#10;room in the hotel, then they would be alone together. He would call&#10;her softly:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Gretta!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Perhaps she would not hear at once: she would be undressing.&#10;Then something in his voice would strike her. She would turn and&#10;look at him&#8230; .&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At the corner of Winetavern Street they met a cab. He was glad&#10;of its rattling noise as it saved him from conversation. She was&#10;looking out of the window and seemed tired. The others spoke only a&#10;few words, pointing out some building or street. The horse galloped&#10;along wearily under the murky morning sky, dragging his old&#10;rattling box after his heels, and Gabriel was again in a cab with&#10;her, galloping to catch the boat, galloping to their honeymoon.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As the cab drove across O&#39;Connell Bridge Miss O&#39;Callaghan&#10;said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;They say you never cross O&#39;Connell Bridge without seeing a&#10;white horse.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I see a white man this time,&#34; said Gabriel.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Where?&#34; asked Mr. Bartell D&#39;Arcy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Gabriel pointed to the statue, on which lay patches of snow.&#10;Then he nodded familiarly to it and waved his hand.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Good-night, Dan,&#34; he said gaily.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When the cab drew up before the hotel, Gabriel jumped out and,&#10;in spite of Mr. Bartell D&#39;Arcy&#39;s protest, paid the driver. He gave&#10;the man a shilling over his fare. The man saluted and said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;A prosperous New Year to you, sir.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The same to you,&#34; said Gabriel cordially.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She leaned for a moment on his arm in getting out of the cab and&#10;while standing at the curbstone, bidding the others good- night.&#10;She leaned lightly on his arm, as lightly as when she had danced&#10;with him a few hours before. He had felt proud and happy then,&#10;happy that she was his, proud of her grace and wifely carriage. But&#10;now, after the kindling again of so many memories, the first touch&#10;of her body, musical and strange and perfumed, sent through him a&#10;keen pang of lust. Under cover of her silence he pressed her arm&#10;closely to his side; and, as they stood at the hotel door, he felt&#10;that they had escaped from their lives and duties, escaped from&#10;home and friends and run away together with wild and radiant hearts&#10;to a new adventure.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;An old man was dozing in a great hooded chair in the hall. He&#10;lit a candle in the office and went before them to the stairs. They&#10;followed him in silence, their feet falling in soft thuds on the&#10;thickly carpeted stairs. She mounted the stairs behind the porter,&#10;her head bowed in the ascent, her frail shoulders curved as with a&#10;burden, her skirt girt tightly about her. He could have flung his&#10;arms about her hips and held her still, for his arms were trembling&#10;with desire to seize her and only the stress of his nails against&#10;the palms of his hands held the wild impulse of his body in check.&#10;The porter halted on the stairs to settle his guttering candle.&#10;They halted, too, on the steps below him. In the silence Gabriel&#10;could hear the falling of the molten wax into the tray and the&#10;thumping of his own heart against his ribs.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The porter led them along a corridor and opened a door. Then he&#10;set his unstable candle down on a toilet-table and asked at what&#10;hour they were to be called in the morning.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Eight,&#34; said Gabriel.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The porter pointed to the tap of the electric-light and began a&#10;muttered apology, but Gabriel cut him short.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;We don&#39;t want any light. We have light enough from the street.&#10;And I say,&#34; he added, pointing to the candle, &#34;you might remove&#10;that handsome article, like a good man.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The porter took up his candle again, but slowly, for he was&#10;surprised by such a novel idea. Then he mumbled good-night and went&#10;out. Gabriel shot the lock to.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A ghastly light from the street lamp lay in a long shaft from&#10;one window to the door. Gabriel threw his overcoat and hat on a&#10;couch and crossed the room towards the window. He looked down into&#10;the street in order that his emotion might calm a little. Then he&#10;turned and leaned against a chest of drawers with his back to the&#10;light. She had taken off her hat and cloak and was standing before&#10;a large swinging mirror, unhooking her waist. Gabriel paused for a&#10;few moments, watching her, and then said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Gretta! &#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She turned away from the mirror slowly and walked along the&#10;shaft of light towards him. Her face looked so serious and weary&#10;that the words would not pass Gabriel&#39;s lips. No, it was not the&#10;moment yet.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You looked tired,&#34; he said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I am a little,&#34; she answered.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You don&#39;t feel ill or weak?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No, tired: that&#39;s all.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She went on to the window and stood there, looking out. Gabriel&#10;waited again and then, fearing that diffidence was about to conquer&#10;him, he said abruptly:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;By the way, Gretta!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What is it?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You know that poor fellow Malins?&#34; he said quickly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes. What about him?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well, poor fellow, he&#39;s a decent sort of chap, after all,&#34;&#10;continued Gabriel in a false voice. &#34;He gave me back that sovereign&#10;I lent him, and I didn&#39;t expect it, really. It&#39;s a pity he wouldn&#39;t&#10;keep away from that Browne, because he&#39;s not a bad fellow,&#10;really.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He was trembling now with annoyance. Why did she seem so&#10;abstracted? He did not know how he could begin. Was she annoyed,&#10;too, about something? If she would only turn to him or come to him&#10;of her own accord! To take her as she was would be brutal. No, he&#10;must see some ardour in her eyes first. He longed to be master of&#10;her strange mood.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;When did you lend him the pound?&#34; she asked, after a pause.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Gabriel strove to restrain himself from breaking out into brutal&#10;language about the sottish Malins and his pound. He longed to cry&#10;to her from his soul, to crush her body against his, to overmaster&#10;her. But he said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O, at Christmas, when he opened that little Christmas-card shop&#10;in Henry Street.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He was in such a fever of rage and desire that he did not hear&#10;her come from the window. She stood before him for an instant,&#10;looking at him strangely. Then, suddenly raising herself on tiptoe&#10;and resting her hands lightly on his shoulders, she kissed him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You are a very generous person, Gabriel,&#34; she said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Gabriel, trembling with delight at her sudden kiss and at the&#10;quaintness of her phrase, put his hands on her hair and began&#10;smoothing it back, scarcely touching it with his fingers. The&#10;washing had made it fine and brilliant. His heart was brimming over&#10;with happiness. Just when he was wishing for it she had come to him&#10;of her own accord. Perhaps her thoughts had been running with his.&#10;Perhaps she had felt the impetuous desire that was in him, and then&#10;the yielding mood had come upon her. Now that she had fallen to him&#10;so easily, he wondered why he had been so diffident.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He stood, holding her head between his hands. Then, slipping one&#10;arm swiftly about her body and drawing her towards him, he said&#10;softly:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Gretta, dear, what are you thinking about?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She did not answer nor yield wholly to his arm. He said again,&#10;softly:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Tell me what it is, Gretta. I think I know what is the matter.&#10;Do I know?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She did not answer at once. Then she said in an outburst of&#10;tears:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O, I am thinking about that song, The Lass of Aughrim.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She broke loose from him and ran to the bed and, throwing her&#10;arms across the bed-rail, hid her face. Gabriel stood stockstill&#10;for a moment in astonishment and then followed her. As he passed in&#10;the way of the cheval-glass he caught sight of himself in full&#10;length, his broad, well-filled shirt-front, the face whose&#10;expression always puzzled him when he saw it in a mirror, and his&#10;glimmering gilt-rimmed eyeglasses. He halted a few paces from her&#10;and said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What about the song? Why does that make you cry?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She raised her head from her arms and dried her eyes with the&#10;back of her hand like a child. A kinder note than he had intended&#10;went into his voice.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why, Gretta?&#34; he asked.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I am thinking about a person long ago who used to sing that&#10;song.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And who was the person long ago?&#34; asked Gabriel, smiling.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It was a person I used to know in Galway when I was living with&#10;my grandmother,&#34; she said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The smile passed away from Gabriel&#39;s face. A dull anger began to&#10;gather again at the back of his mind and the dull fires of his lust&#10;began to glow angrily in his veins.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Someone you were in love with?&#34; he asked ironically.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It was a young boy I used to know,&#34; she answered, &#34;named&#10;Michael Furey. He used to sing that song, The Lass of Aughrim. He&#10;was very delicate.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Gabriel was silent. He did not wish her to think that he was&#10;interested in this delicate boy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I can see him so plainly,&#34; she said, after a moment. &#34;Such eyes&#10;as he had: big, dark eyes! And such an expression in them &#8212; an&#10;expression!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O, then, you are in love with him?&#34; said Gabriel.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I used to go out walking with him,&#34; she said, &#34;when I was in&#10;Galway.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A thought flew across Gabriel&#39;s mind.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Perhaps that was why you wanted to go to Galway with that Ivors&#10;girl?&#34; he said coldly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She looked at him and asked in surprise:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What for?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Her eyes made Gabriel feel awkward. He shrugged his shoulders&#10;and said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;How do I know? To see him, perhaps.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She looked away from him along the shaft of light towards the&#10;window in silence.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;He is dead,&#34; she said at length. &#34;He died when he was only&#10;seventeen. Isn&#39;t it a terrible thing to die so young as that?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What was he?&#34; asked Gabriel, still ironically.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;He was in the gasworks,&#34; she said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Gabriel felt humiliated by the failure of his irony and by the&#10;evocation of this figure from the dead, a boy in the gasworks.&#10;While he had been full of memories of their secret life together,&#10;full of tenderness and joy and desire, she had been comparing him&#10;in her mind with another. A shameful consciousness of his own&#10;person assailed him. He saw himself as a ludicrous figure, acting&#10;as a pennyboy for his aunts, a nervous, well-meaning&#10;sentimentalist, orating to vulgarians and idealising his own&#10;clownish lusts, the pitiable fatuous fellow he had caught a glimpse&#10;of in the mirror. Instinctively he turned his back more to the&#10;light lest she might see the shame that burned upon his&#10;forehead.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He tried to keep up his tone of cold interrogation, but his&#10;voice when he spoke was humble and indifferent.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I suppose you were in love with this Michael Furey, Gretta,&#34; he&#10;said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I was great with him at that time,&#34; she said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Her voice was veiled and sad. Gabriel, feeling now how vain it&#10;would be to try to lead her whither he had purposed, caressed one&#10;of her hands and said, also sadly:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And what did he die of so young, Gretta? Consumption, was&#10;it?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I think he died for me,&#34; she answered.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A vague terror seized Gabriel at this answer, as if, at that&#10;hour when he had hoped to triumph, some impalpable and vindictive&#10;being was coming against him, gathering forces against him in its&#10;vague world. But he shook himself free of it with an effort of&#10;reason and continued to caress her hand. He did not question her&#10;again, for he felt that she would tell him of herself. Her hand was&#10;warm and moist: it did not respond to his touch, but he continued&#10;to caress it just as he had caressed her first letter to him that&#10;spring morning.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It was in the winter,&#34; she said, &#34;about the beginning of the&#10;winter when I was going to leave my grandmother&#39;s and come up here&#10;to the convent. And he was ill at the time in his lodgings in&#10;Galway and wouldn&#39;t be let out, and his people in Oughterard were&#10;written to. He was in decline, they said, or something like that. I&#10;never knew rightly.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She paused for a moment and sighed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Poor fellow,&#34; she said. &#34;He was very fond of me and he was such&#10;a gentle boy. We used to go out together, walking, you know,&#10;Gabriel, like the way they do in the country. He was going to study&#10;singing only for his health. He had a very good voice, poor Michael&#10;Furey.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well; and then?&#34; asked Gabriel.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And then when it came to the time for me to leave Galway and&#10;come up to the convent he was much worse and I wouldn&#39;t be let see&#10;him so I wrote him a letter saying I was going up to Dublin and&#10;would be back in the summer, and hoping he would be better&#10;then.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She paused for a moment to get her voice under control, and then&#10;went on:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Then the night before I left, I was in my grandmother&#39;s house&#10;in Nuns&#39; Island, packing up, and I heard gravel thrown up against&#10;the window. The window was so wet I couldn&#39;t see, so I ran&#10;downstairs as I was and slipped out the back into the garden and&#10;there was the poor fellow at the end of the garden, shivering.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And did you not tell him to go back?&#34; asked Gabriel.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I implored of him to go home at once and told him he would get&#10;his death in the rain. But he said he did not want to live. I can&#10;see his eyes as well as well! He was standing at the end of the&#10;wall where there was a tree.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And did he go home?&#34; asked Gabriel.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, he went home. And when I was only a week in the convent he&#10;died and he was buried in Oughterard, where his people came from.&#10;O, the day I heard that, that he was dead!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She stopped, choking with sobs, and, overcome by emotion, flung&#10;herself face downward on the bed, sobbing in the quilt. Gabriel&#10;held her hand for a moment longer, irresolutely, and then, shy of&#10;intruding on her grief, let it fall gently and walked quietly to&#10;the window.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She was fast asleep.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Gabriel, leaning on his elbow, looked for a few moments&#10;unresentfully on her tangled hair and half-open mouth, listening to&#10;her deep-drawn breath. So she had had that romance in her life: a&#10;man had died for her sake. It hardly pained him now to think how&#10;poor a part he, her husband, had played in her life. He watched her&#10;while she slept, as though he and she had never lived together as&#10;man and wife. His curious eyes rested long upon her face and on her&#10;hair: and, as he thought of what she must have been then, in that&#10;time of her first girlish beauty, a strange, friendly pity for her&#10;entered his soul. He did not like to say even to himself that her&#10;face was no longer beautiful, but he knew that it was no longer the&#10;face for which Michael Furey had braved death.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Perhaps she had not told him all the story. His eyes moved to&#10;the chair over which she had thrown some of her clothes. A&#10;petticoat string dangled to the floor. One boot stood upright, its&#10;limp upper fallen down: the fellow of it lay upon its side. He&#10;wondered at his riot of emotions of an hour before. From what had&#10;it proceeded? From his aunt&#39;s supper, from his own foolish speech,&#10;from the wine and dancing, the merry-making when saying good-night&#10;in the hall, the pleasure of the walk along the river in the snow.&#10;Poor Aunt Julia! She, too, would soon be a shade with the shade of&#10;Patrick Morkan and his horse. He had caught that haggard look upon&#10;her face for a moment when she was singing Arrayed for the Bridal.&#10;Soon, perhaps, he would be sitting in that same drawing-room,&#10;dressed in black, his silk hat on his knees. The blinds would be&#10;drawn down and Aunt Kate would be sitting beside him, crying and&#10;blowing her nose and telling him how Julia had died. He would cast&#10;about in his mind for some words that might console her, and would&#10;find only lame and useless ones. Yes, yes: that would happen very&#10;soon.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The air of the room chilled his shoulders. He stretched himself&#10;cautiously along under the sheets and lay down beside his wife. One&#10;by one, they were all becoming shades. Better pass boldly into that&#10;other world, in the full glory of some passion, than fade and&#10;wither dismally with age. He thought of how she who lay beside him&#10;had locked in her heart for so many years that image of her lover&#39;s&#10;eyes when he had told her that he did not wish to live.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Generous tears filled Gabriel&#39;s eyes. He had never felt like&#10;that himself towards any woman, but he knew that such a feeling&#10;must be love. The tears gathered more thickly in his eyes and in&#10;the partial darkness he imagined he saw the form of a young man&#10;standing under a dripping tree. Other forms were near. His soul had&#10;approached that region where dwell the vast hosts of the dead. He&#10;was conscious of, but could not apprehend, their wayward and&#10;flickering existence. His own identity was fading out into a grey&#10;impalpable world: the solid world itself, which these dead had one&#10;time reared and lived in, was dissolving and dwindling.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A few light taps upon the pane made him turn to the window. It&#10;had begun to snow again. He watched sleepily the flakes, silver and&#10;dark, falling obliquely against the lamplight. The time had come&#10;for him to set out on his journey westward. Yes, the newspapers&#10;were right: snow was general all over Ireland. It was falling on&#10;every part of the dark central plain, on the treeless hills,&#10;falling softly upon the Bog of Allen and, farther westward, softly&#10;falling into the dark mutinous Shannon waves. It was falling, too,&#10;upon every part of the lonely churchyard on the hill where Michael&#10;Furey lay buried. It lay thickly drifted on the crooked crosses and&#10;headstones, on the spears of the little gate, on the barren thorns.&#10;His soul swooned slowly as he heard the snow falling faintly&#10;through the universe and faintly falling, like the descent of their&#10;last end, upon all the living and the dead.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 8, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/5', :deleted => 0)
