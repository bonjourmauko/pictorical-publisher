Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;How the Whale got his Throat'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;IN the sea, once upon a time, O my Best Beloved, there was a&#10;Whale, and he ate fishes. He ate the starfish and the garfish, and&#10;the crab and the dab, and the plaice and the dace, and the skate&#10;and his mate, and the mackereel and the pickereel, and the really&#10;truly twirly-whirly eel. All the fishes he could find in all the&#10;sea he ate with his mouth&#8212;so! Till at last there was only one small&#10;fish left in all the sea, and he was a small &#39;Stute Fish, and he&#10;swam a little behind the Whale&#39;s right ear, so as to be out of&#10;harm&#39;s way. Then the Whale stood up on his tail and said, &#39;I&#39;m&#10;hungry.&#39; And the small &#39;Stute Fish said in a small &#39;stute voice,&#10;&#39;Noble and generous Cetacean, have you ever tasted Man?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;No,&#39; said the Whale. &#39;What is it like?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Nice,&#39; said the small &#39;Stute Fish. &#39;Nice but nubbly.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Then fetch me some,&#39; said the Whale, and he made the sea froth&#10;up with his tail.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;One at a time is enough,&#39; said the &#39;Stute Fish. &#39;If you swim to&#10;latitude Fifty North, longitude Forty West (that is magic), you&#10;will find, sitting&#38;#160;&#60;em&#62;on&#60;/em&#62;&#38;#160;a&#10;raft,&#38;#160;&#60;em&#62;in&#60;/em&#62;&#38;#160;the middle of the sea, with nothing on&#10;but a pair of blue canvas breeches, a pair of suspenders (you&#10;must&#60;em&#62;not&#60;/em&#62;&#38;#160;forget the suspenders, Best Beloved), and a&#10;jack-knife, one ship-wrecked Mariner, who, it is only fair to tell&#10;you, is a man of infinite-resource-and-sagacity.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So the Whale swam and swam to latitude Fifty North, longitude&#10;Forty West, as fast as he could swim, and&#38;#160;&#60;em&#62;on&#60;/em&#62;&#38;#160;a&#10;raft,&#38;#160;&#60;em&#62;in&#60;/em&#62;&#38;#160;the middle of the&#10;sea,&#38;#160;&#60;em&#62;with&#60;/em&#62;&#38;#160;nothing to wear except a pair of blue&#10;canvas breeches, a pair of suspenders (you must particularly&#10;remember the suspenders, Best Beloved),&#38;#160;&#60;em&#62;and&#60;/em&#62;&#38;#160;a&#10;jack-knife, he found one single, solitary shipwrecked Mariner,&#10;trailing his toes in the water. (He had his mummy&#39;s leave to&#10;paddle, or else he would never have done it, because he was a man&#10;of infinite-resource-and-sagacity.)&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then the Whale opened his mouth back and back and back till it&#10;nearly touched his tail, and he swallowed the shipwrecked Mariner,&#10;and the raft he was sitting on, and his blue canvas breeches, and&#10;the suspenders (which you&#38;#160;&#60;em&#62;must&#60;/em&#62;&#38;#160;not&#10;forget),&#38;#160;&#60;em&#62;and&#60;/em&#62;&#38;#160;the jack-knife&#8212;He swallowed them&#10;all down into his warm, dark, inside cup-boards, and then he&#10;smacked his lips&#8212;so, and turned round three times on his tail.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But as soon as the Mariner, who was a man of&#10;infinite-resource-and-sagacity, found himself truly inside the&#10;Whale&#39;s warm, dark, inside cup-boards, he stumped and he jumped and&#10;he thumped and he bumped, and he pranced and he danced, and he&#10;banged and he clanged, and he hit and he bit, and he leaped and he&#10;creeped, and he prowled and he howled, and he hopped and he&#10;dropped, and he cried and he sighed, and he crawled and he bawled,&#10;and he stepped and he lepped, and he danced hornpipes where he&#10;shouldn&#39;t, and the Whale felt most unhappy indeed.&#10;(&#60;em&#62;Have&#60;/em&#62;&#38;#160;you forgotten the suspenders?)&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So he said to the &#39;Stute Fish, &#39;This man is very nubbly, and&#10;besides he is making me hiccough. What shall I do?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Tell him to come out,&#39; said the &#39;Stute Fish.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So the Whale called down his own throat to the shipwrecked&#10;Mariner, &#39;Come out and behave yourself. I&#39;ve got the&#10;hiccoughs.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Nay, nay!&#39; said the Mariner. &#39;Not so, but far otherwise. Take&#10;me to my natal-shore and the white-cliffs-of-Albion, and I&#39;ll think&#10;about it.&#39; And he began to dance more than ever.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;You had better take him home,&#39; said the &#39;Stute Fish to the&#10;Whale. &#39;I ought to have warned you that he is a man of&#10;infinite-resource-and-sagacity.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So the Whale swam and swam and swam, with both flippers and his&#10;tail, as hard as he could for the hiccoughs; and at last he saw the&#10;Mariner&#39;s natal-shore and the white-cliffs-of-Albion, and he rushed&#10;half-way up the beach, and opened his mouth wide and wide and wide,&#10;and said, &#39;Change here for Winchester, Ashuelot, Nashua, Keene, and&#10;stations on the&#38;#160;&#60;em&#62;Fitch&#60;/em&#62;burg Road;&#39; and just as he said&#10;&#39;Fitch&#39; the Mariner walked out of his mouth. But while the Whale&#10;had been swimming, the Mariner, who was indeed a person of&#10;infinite-resource-and-sagacity, had taken his jack-knife and cut up&#10;the raft into a little square grating all running criss-cross, and&#10;he had tied it firm with his suspenders (&#60;em&#62;now&#60;/em&#62;, you know why&#10;you were not to forget the suspenders!), and he dragged that&#10;grating good and tight into the Whale&#39;s throat, and there it stuck!&#10;Then he recited the following&#38;#160;&#60;em&#62;Sloka&#60;/em&#62;, which, as you&#10;have not heard it, I will now proceed to relate&#8212;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;By means of a grating&#60;br /&#62;&#10;I have stopped your ating.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For the Mariner he was also an Hi-ber-ni-an. And he stepped out&#10;on the shingle, and went home to his mother, who had given him&#10;leave to trail his toes in the water; and he married and lived&#10;happily ever afterward. So did the Whale. But from that day on, the&#10;grating in his throat, which he could neither cough up nor swallow&#10;down, prevented him eating anything except very, very small fish;&#10;and that is the reason why whales nowadays never eat men or boys or&#10;little girls.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The small &#39;Stute Fish went and hid himself in the mud under the&#10;Door-sills of the Equator. He was afraid that the Whale might be&#10;angry with him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Sailor took the jack-knife home. He was wearing the blue&#10;canvas breeches when he walked out on the shingle. The suspenders&#10;were left behind, you see, to tie the grating with; and that is the&#10;end of&#38;#160;&#60;em&#62;that&#60;/em&#62;&#38;#160;tale.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;WHEN the cabin port-holes are dark and green&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;Because of the seas outside;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;When the ship goes &#60;em&#62;wop&#60;/em&#62; (with a wiggle between)&#60;br /&#62;&#10;And the steward falls into the soup-tureen,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;And the trunks begin to slide;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;When Nursey lies on the floor in a heap,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;And Mummy tells you to let her sleep,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;And you aren&#39;t waked or washed or dressed,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Why, then you will know (if you haven&#39;t guessed)&#60;br /&#62;&#10;You&#39;re &#39;Fifty North and Forty West!&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 10, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/865', :deleted => 0)

So he&#10;ate sticks and thorns and tamarisks and milkweed and prickles, most&#10;&#39;scruciating idle; and when anybody spoke to him he said &#39;Humph!&#39;&#10;Just &#39;Humph!&#39; and no more.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Presently the Horse came to him on Monday morning, with a saddle&#10;on his back and a bit in his mouth, and said, &#39;Camel, O Camel, come&#10;out and trot like the rest of us.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Humph!&#39; said the Camel; and the Horse went away and told the&#10;Man.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Presently the Dog came to him, with a stick in his mouth, and&#10;said, &#39;Camel, O Camel, come and fetch and carry like the rest of&#10;us.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Humph!&#39; said the Camel; and the Dog went away and told the&#10;Man.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Presently the Ox came to him, with the yoke on his neck and&#10;said, &#39;Camel, O Camel, come and plough like the rest of us.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Humph!&#39; said the Camel; and the Ox went away and told the&#10;Man.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At the end of the day the Man called the Horse and the Dog and&#10;the Ox together, and said, &#39;Three, O Three, I&#39;m very sorry for you&#10;(with the world so new-and-all); but that Humph-thing in the Desert&#10;can&#39;t work, or he would have been here by now, so I am going to&#10;leave him alone, and you must work double-time to make up for&#10;it.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;That made the Three very angry (with the world so new-and-all),&#10;and they held a palaver, and an&#38;#160;&#60;em&#62;indaba&#60;/em&#62;, and&#10;a&#38;#160;&#60;em&#62;punchayet&#60;/em&#62;, and a pow-wow on the edge of the Desert;&#10;and the Camel came chewing on&#10;milkweed&#38;#160;&#60;em&#62;most&#60;/em&#62;&#38;#160;&#39;scruciating idle, and laughed at&#10;them. Then he said &#39;Humph!&#39; and went away again.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Presently there came along the Djinn in charge of All Deserts,&#10;rolling in a cloud of dust (Djinns always travel that way because&#10;it is Magic), and he stopped to palaver and pow-pow with the&#10;Three.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Djinn of All Deserts,&#39; said the Horse, &#39;is it right for any one&#10;to be idle, with the world so new-and-all?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Certainly not,&#39; said the Djinn.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Well,&#39; said the Horse, &#39;there&#39;s a thing in the middle of your&#10;Howling Desert (and he&#39;s a Howler himself) with a long neck and&#10;long legs, and he hasn&#39;t done a stroke of work since Monday&#10;morning. He won&#39;t trot.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Whew!&#39; said the Djinn, whistling, &#39;that&#39;s my Camel, for all the&#10;gold in Arabia! What does he say about it?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;He says &#34;Humph!&#34;&#39; said the Dog; &#39;and he won&#39;t fetch and&#10;carry.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Does he say anything else?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Only &#34;Humph!&#34;; and he won&#39;t plough,&#39; said the Ox.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Very good,&#39; said the Djinn. &#39;I&#39;ll humph him if you will kindly&#10;wait a minute.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Djinn rolled himself up in his dust-cloak, and took a&#10;bearing across the desert, and found the Camel most &#39;scruciatingly&#10;idle, looking at his own reflection in a pool of water.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;My long and bubbling friend,&#39; said the Djinn, &#39;what&#39;s this I&#10;hear of your doing no work, with the world so new-and-all?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Humph!&#39; said the Camel.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Djinn sat down, with his chin in his hand, and began to&#10;think a Great Magic, while the Camel looked at his own reflection&#10;in the pool of water.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;You&#39;ve given the Three extra work ever since Monday morning,&#10;all on account of your &#39;scruciating idleness,&#39; said the Djinn; and&#10;he went on thinking Magics, with his chin in his hand.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Humph!&#39; said the Camel.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;I shouldn&#39;t say that again if I were you,&#39; said the Djinn; you&#10;might say it once too often. Bubbles, I want you to work.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And the Camel said &#39;Humph!&#39; again; but no sooner had he said it&#10;than he saw his back, that he was so proud of, puffing up and&#10;puffing up into a great big lolloping humph.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Do you see that?&#39; said the Djinn. &#39;That&#39;s your very own humph&#10;that you&#39;ve brought upon your very own self by not working. To-day&#10;is Thursday, and you&#39;ve done no work since Monday, when the work&#10;began. Now you are going to work.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;How can I,&#39; said the Camel, &#39;with this humph on my back?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;That&#39;s made a-purpose,&#39; said the Djinn, &#39;all because you missed&#10;those three days. You will be able to work now for three days&#10;without eating, because you can live on your humph; and don&#39;t you&#10;ever say I never did anything for you. Come out of the Desert and&#10;go to the Three, and behave. Humph yourself!&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And the Camel humphed himself, humph and all, and went away to&#10;join the Three. And from that day to this the Camel always wears a&#10;humph (we call it &#39;hump&#39; now, not to hurt his feelings); but he has&#10;never yet caught up with the three days that he missed at the&#10;beginning of the world, and he has never yet learned how to&#10;behave.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;THE Camel&#39;s hump is an ugly lump&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;Which well you may see at the Zoo;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;But uglier yet is the hump we get&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;From having too little to do.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Kiddies and grown-ups too-oo-oo,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;If we haven&#39;t enough to do-oo-oo,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160; &#38;#160; &#38;#160;We get the hump&#8212;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160; &#38;#160; &#38;#160;Cameelious hump&#8212;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;The hump that is black and blue!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;We climb out of bed with a frouzly head&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;And a snarly-yarly voice.&#60;br /&#62;&#10;We shiver and scowl and we grunt and we growl&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;At our bath and our boots and our toys;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And there ought to be a corner for me&#60;br /&#62;&#10;(And I know there is one for you)&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160; &#38;#160; &#38;#160;When we get the hump&#8212;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160; &#38;#160; &#38;#160;Cameelious hump&#8212;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;The hump that is black and blue!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The cure for this ill is not to sit still,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;Or frowst with a book by the fire;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;But to take a large hoe and a shovel also,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;And dig till you gently perspire;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And then you will find that the sun and the wind.&#60;br /&#62;&#10;And the Djinn of the Garden too,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160; &#38;#160; &#38;#160;Have lifted the hump&#8212;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160; &#38;#160; &#38;#160;The horrible hump&#8212;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;The hump that is black and blue!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I get it as well as you-oo-oo&#8212;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;If I haven&#39;t enough to do-oo-oo&#8212;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160; &#38;#160; &#38;#160;We all get hump&#8212;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160; &#38;#160; &#38;#160;Cameelious hump&#8212;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Kiddies and grown-ups too!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 10, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/865', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;How the Rhinoceros got his Skin'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;ONCE upon a time, on an uninhabited island on the shores of the&#10;Red Sea, there lived a Parsee from whose hat the rays of the sun&#10;were reflected in more-than-oriental splendour. And the Parsee&#10;lived by the Red Sea with nothing but his hat and his knife and a&#10;cooking-stove of the kind that you must particularly never touch.&#10;And one day he took flour and water and currants and plums and&#10;sugar and things, and made himself one cake which was two feet&#10;across and three feet thick. It was indeed a Superior Comestible&#10;(that&#39;s magic), and he put it on stove because he was allowed to&#10;cook on the stove, and he baked it and he baked it till it was all&#10;done brown and smelt most sentimental. But just as he was going to&#10;eat it there came down to the beach from the Altogether Uninhabited&#10;Interior one Rhinoceros with a horn on his nose, two piggy eyes,&#10;and few manners. In those days the Rhinoceros&#39;s skin fitted him&#10;quite tight. There were no wrinkles in it anywhere. He looked&#10;exactly like a Noah&#39;s Ark Rhinoceros, but of course much bigger.&#10;All the same, he had no manners then, and he has no manners now,&#10;and he never will have any manners. He said, &#39;How!&#39; and the Parsee&#10;left that cake and climbed to the top of a palm tree with nothing&#10;on but his hat, from which the rays of the sun were always&#10;reflected in more-than-oriental splendour. And the Rhinoceros upset&#10;the oil-stove with his nose, and the cake rolled on the sand, and&#10;he spiked that cake on the horn of his nose, and he ate it, and he&#10;went away, waving his tail, to the desolate and Exclusively&#10;Uninhabited Interior which abuts on the islands of Mazanderan,&#10;Socotra, and Promontories of the Larger Equinox. Then the Parsee&#10;came down from his palm-tree and put the stove on its legs and&#10;recited the following Sloka, which, as you have not heard, I will&#10;now proceed to relate:&#8212;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Them that takes cakes&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Which the Parsee-man bakes&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Makes dreadful mistakes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And there was a great deal more in that than you would&#10;think.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Because, five weeks later, there was a heat wave in the Red Sea,&#10;and everybody took off all the clothes they had. The Parsee took&#10;off his hat; but the Rhinoceros took off his skin and carried it&#10;over his shoulder as he came down to the beach to bathe. In those&#10;days it buttoned underneath with three buttons and looked like a&#10;waterproof. He said nothing whatever about the Parsee&#39;s cake,&#10;because he had eaten it all; and he never had any manners, then,&#10;since, or henceforward. He waddled straight into the water and blew&#10;bubbles through his nose, leaving his skin on the beach.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Presently the Parsee came by and found the skin, and he smiled&#10;one smile that ran all round his face two times. Then he danced&#10;three times round the skin and rubbed his hands. Then he went to&#10;his camp and filled his hat with cake-crumbs, for the Parsee never&#10;ate anything but cake, and never swept out his camp. He took that&#10;skin, and he shook that skin, and he scrubbed that skin, and he&#10;rubbed that skin just as full of old, dry, stale, tickly&#10;cake-crumbs and some burned currants as ever it could possibly&#10;hold. Then he climbed to the top of his palm-tree and waited for&#10;the Rhinoceros to come out of the water and put it on.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And the Rhinoceros did. He buttoned it up with the three&#10;buttons, and it tickled like cake crumbs in bed. Then he wanted to&#10;scratch, but that made it worse; and then he lay down on the sands&#10;and rolled and rolled and rolled, and every time he rolled the cake&#10;crumbs tickled him worse and worse and worse. Then he ran to the&#10;palm-tree and rubbed and rubbed and rubbed himself against it. He&#10;rubbed so much and so hard that he rubbed his skin into a great&#10;fold over his shoulders, and another fold underneath, where the&#10;buttons used to be (but he rubbed the buttons off), and he rubbed&#10;some more folds over his legs. And it spoiled his temper, but it&#10;didn&#39;t make the least difference to the cake-crumbs. They were&#10;inside his skin and they tickled. So he went home, very angry&#10;indeed and horribly scratchy; and from that day to this every&#10;rhinoceros has great folds in his skin and a very bad temper, all&#10;on account of the cake-crumbs inside.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But the Parsee came down from his palm-tree, wearing his hat,&#10;from which the rays of the sun were reflected in more-than-oriental&#10;splendour, packed up his cooking-stove, and went away in the&#10;direction of Orotavo, Amygdala, the Upland Meadows of Anantarivo,&#10;and the Marshes of Sonaput.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;THIS Uninhabited Island&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;Is off Cape Gardafui,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;By the Beaches of Socotra&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;And the Pink Arabian Sea:&#60;br /&#62;&#10;But it&#39;s hot&#8212;too hot from Suez&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;For the likes of you and me&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160; &#38;#160; &#38;#160;Ever to go&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160; &#38;#160; &#38;#160;In a P. and O.&#60;br /&#62;&#10;And call on the Cake-Parsee!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 10, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/865', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;How the Leopard got his Spots'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;IN the days when everybody started fair, Best Beloved, the&#10;Leopard lived in a place called the High Veldt. &#39;Member it wasn&#39;t&#10;the Low Veldt, or the Bush Veldt, or the Sour Veldt, but the&#10;&#39;sclusively bare, hot, shiny High Veldt, where there was sand and&#10;sandy-coloured rock and &#39;sclusively tufts of sandy-yellowish grass.&#10;The Giraffe and the Zebra and the Eland and the Koodoo and the&#10;Hartebeest lived there; and they were &#39;sclusively&#10;sandy-yellow-brownish all over; but the Leopard, he was the&#10;&#39;sclusivest sandiest-yellowish-brownest of them all&#8212;a&#10;greyish-yellowish catty-shaped kind of beast, and he matched the&#10;&#39;sclusively yellowish-greyish-brownish colour of the High Veldt to&#10;one hair. This was very bad for the Giraffe and the Zebra and the&#10;rest of them; for he would lie down by a &#39;sclusively&#10;yellowish-greyish-brownish stone or clump of grass, and when the&#10;Giraffe or the Zebra or the Eland or the Koodoo or the Bush-Buck or&#10;the Bonte-Buck came by he would surprise them out of their jumpsome&#10;lives. He would indeed! And, also, there was an Ethiopian with bows&#10;and arrows (a &#39;sclusively greyish-brownish-yellowish man he was&#10;then), who lived on the High Veldt with the Leopard; and the two&#10;used to hunt together&#8212;the Ethiopian with his bows and arrows, and&#10;the Leopard &#39;sclusively with his teeth and claws&#8212;till the Giraffe&#10;and the Eland and the Koodoo and the Quagga and all the rest of&#10;them didn&#39;t know which way to jump, Best Beloved. They didn&#39;t&#10;indeed!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;After a long time&#8212;things lived for ever so long in those&#10;days&#8212;they learned to avoid anything that looked like a Leopard or&#10;an Ethiopian; and bit by bit&#8212;the Giraffe began it, because his legs&#10;were the longest&#8212;they went away from the High Veldt. They scuttled&#10;for days and days and days till they came to a great forest,&#10;&#39;sclusively full of trees and bushes and stripy, speckly,&#10;patchy-blatchy shadows, and there they hid: and after another long&#10;time, what with standing half in the shade and half out of it, and&#10;what with the slippery-slidy shadows of the trees falling on them,&#10;the Giraffe grew blotchy, and the Zebra grew stripy, and the Eland&#10;and the Koodoo grew darker, with little wavy grey lines on their&#10;backs like bark on a tree trunk; and so, though you could hear them&#10;and smell them, you could very seldom see them, and then only when&#10;you knew precisely where to look. They had a beautiful time in the&#10;&#39;sclusively speckly-spickly shadows of the forest, while the&#10;Leopard and the Ethiopian ran about over the &#39;sclusively&#10;greyish-yellowish-reddish High Veldt outside, wondering where all&#10;their breakfasts and their dinners and their teas had gone. At last&#10;they were so hungry that they ate rats and beetles and&#10;rock-rabbits, the Leopard and the Ethiopian, and then they had the&#10;Big Tummy-ache, both together; and then they met Baviaan&#8212;the&#10;dog-headed, barking Baboon, who is Quite the Wisest Animal in All&#10;South Africa.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Said Leopard to Baviaan (and it was a very hot day), &#39;Where has&#10;all the game gone?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And Baviaan winked. He knew.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Said the Ethiopian to Baviaan, &#39;Can you tell me the present&#10;habitat of the aboriginal Fauna?&#39; (That meant just the same thing,&#10;but the Ethiopian always used long words. He was a grown-up.)&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And Baviaan winked. He knew.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then said Baviaan, &#39;The game has gone into other spots; and my&#10;advice to you, Leopard, is to go into other spots as soon as you&#10;can.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And the Ethiopian said, &#39;That is all very fine, but I wish to&#10;know whither the aboriginal Fauna has migrated.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then said Baviaan, &#39;The aboriginal Fauna has joined the&#10;aboriginal Flora because it was high time for a change; and my&#10;advice to you, Ethiopian, is to change as soon as you can.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;That puzzled the Leopard and the Ethiopian, but they set off to&#10;look for the aboriginal Flora, and presently, after ever so many&#10;days, they saw a great, high, tall forest full of tree trunks all&#10;&#39;sclusively speckled and sprottled and spottled, dotted and&#10;splashed and slashed and hatched and cross-hatched with shadows.&#10;(Say that quickly aloud, and you will see how very shadowy the&#10;forest must have been.)&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;What is this,&#39; said the Leopard, &#39;that is so &#39;sclusively dark,&#10;and yet so full of little pieces of light?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;I don&#39;t know, said the Ethiopian, &#39;but it ought to be the&#10;aboriginal Flora. I can smell Giraffe, and I can hear Giraffe, but&#10;I can&#39;t see Giraffe.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;That&#39;s curious,&#39; said the Leopard. &#39;I suppose it is because we&#10;have just come in out of the sunshine. I can smell Zebra, and I can&#10;hear Zebra, but I can&#39;t see Zebra.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Wait a bit, said the Ethiopian. &#39;It&#39;s a long time since we&#39;ve&#10;hunted &#39;em. Perhaps we&#39;ve forgotten what they were like.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Fiddle!&#39; said the Leopard. &#39;I remember them perfectly on the&#10;High Veldt, especially their marrow-bones. Giraffe is about&#10;seventeen feet high, of a &#39;sclusively fulvous golden-yellow from&#10;head to heel; and Zebra is about four and a half feet high, of&#10;a&#39;sclusively grey-fawn colour from head to heel.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Umm, said the Ethiopian, looking into the speckly-spickly&#10;shadows of the aboriginal Flora-forest. &#39;Then they ought to show up&#10;in this dark place like ripe bananas in a smokehouse.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But they didn&#39;t. The Leopard and the Ethiopian hunted all day;&#10;and though they could smell them and hear them, they never saw one&#10;of them.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;For goodness&#39; sake,&#39; said the Leopard at tea-time, &#39;let us wait&#10;till it gets dark. This daylight hunting is a perfect scandal.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So they waited till dark, and then the Leopard heard something&#10;breathing sniffily in the starlight that fell all stripy through&#10;the branches, and he jumped at the noise, and it smelt like Zebra,&#10;and it felt like Zebra, and when he knocked it down it kicked like&#10;Zebra, but he couldn&#39;t see it. So he said, &#39;Be quiet, O you person&#10;without any form. I am going to sit on your head till morning,&#10;because there is something about you that I don&#39;t understand.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Presently he heard a grunt and a crash and a scramble, and the&#10;Ethiopian called out, &#39;I&#39;ve caught a thing that I can&#39;t see. It&#10;smells like Giraffe, and it kicks like Giraffe, but it hasn&#39;t any&#10;form.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Don&#39;t you trust it,&#39; said the Leopard. &#39;Sit on its head till&#10;the morning&#8212;same as me. They haven&#39;t any form&#8212;any of &#39;em.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So they sat down on them hard till bright morning-time, and then&#10;Leopard said, &#39;What have you at your end of the table,&#10;Brother?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Ethiopian scratched his head and said, &#39;It ought to be&#10;&#39;sclusively a rich fulvous orange-tawny from head to heel, and it&#10;ought to be Giraffe; but it is covered all over with chestnut&#10;blotches. What have you at your end of the table, Brother?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And the Leopard scratched his head and said, &#39;It ought to be&#10;&#39;sclusively a delicate greyish-fawn, and it ought to be Zebra; but&#10;it is covered all over with black and purple stripes. What in the&#10;world have you been doing to yourself, Zebra? Don&#39;t you know that&#10;if you were on the High Veldt I could see you ten miles off? You&#10;haven&#39;t any form.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Yes,&#39; said the Zebra, &#39;but this isn&#39;t the High Veldt. Can&#39;t you&#10;see?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;I can now,&#39; said the Leopard. &#39;But I couldn&#39;t all yesterday.&#10;How is it done?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Let us up,&#39; said the Zebra, &#39;and we will show you.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;They let the Zebra and the Giraffe get up; and Zebra moved away&#10;to some little thorn-bushes where the sunlight fell all stripy, and&#10;Giraffe moved off to some tallish trees where the shadows fell all&#10;blotchy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Now watch,&#39; said the Zebra and the Giraffe. &#39;This is the way&#10;it&#39;s done. One&#8212;two&#8212;three! And where&#39;s your breakfast?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Leopard stared, and Ethiopian stared, but all they could see&#10;were stripy shadows and blotched shadows in the forest, but never a&#10;sign of Zebra and Giraffe. They had just walked off and hidden&#10;themselves in the shadowy forest.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Hi! Hi!&#39; said the Ethiopian. &#39;That&#39;s a trick worth learning.&#10;Take a lesson by it, Leopard. You show up in this dark place like a&#10;bar of soap in a coal-scuttle.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Ho! Ho!&#39; said the Leopard. &#39;Would it surprise you very much to&#10;know that you show up in this dark place like a mustard-plaster on&#10;a sack of coals?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Well, calling names won&#39;t catch dinner, said the Ethiopian.&#10;&#39;The long and the little of it is that we don&#39;t match our&#10;backgrounds. I&#39;m going to take Baviaan&#39;s advice. He told me I ought&#10;to change; and as I&#39;ve nothing to change except my skin I&#39;m going&#10;to change that.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;What to?&#39; said the Leopard, tremendously excited.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;To a nice working blackish-brownish colour, with a little&#10;purple in it, and touches of slaty-blue. It will be the very thing&#10;for hiding in hollows and behind trees.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So he changed his skin then and there, and the Leopard was more&#10;excited than ever; he had never seen a man change his skin&#10;before.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;But what about me?&#39; he said, when the Ethiopian had worked his&#10;last little finger into his fine new black skin.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;You take Baviaan&#39;s advice too. He told you to go into&#10;spots.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;So I did,&#39; said the Leopard. I went into other spots as fast as&#10;I could. I went into this spot with you, and a lot of good it has&#10;done me.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Oh,&#39; said the Ethiopian, &#39;Baviaan didn&#39;t mean spots in South&#10;Africa. He meant spots on your skin.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;What&#39;s the use of that?&#39; said the Leopard.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Think of Giraffe,&#39; said the Ethiopian. &#39;Or if you prefer&#10;stripes, think of Zebra. They find their spots and stripes give&#10;them per-feet satisfaction.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Umm,&#39; said the Leopard. &#39;I wouldn&#39;t look like Zebra&#8212;not for&#10;ever so.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Well, make up your mind,&#39; said the Ethiopian, &#39;because I&#39;d hate&#10;to go hunting without you, but I must if you insist on looking like&#10;a sun-flower against a tarred fence.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;I&#39;ll take spots, then,&#39; said the Leopard; &#39;but don&#39;t make &#39;em&#10;too vulgar-big. I wouldn&#39;t look like Giraffe&#8212;not for ever so.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;I&#39;ll make &#39;em with the tips of my fingers,&#39; said the Ethiopian.&#10;&#39;There&#39;s plenty of black left on my skin still. Stand over!&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then the Ethiopian put his five fingers close together (there&#10;was plenty of black left on his new skin still) and pressed them&#10;all over the Leopard, and wherever the five fingers touched they&#10;left five little black marks, all close together. You can see them&#10;on any Leopard&#39;s skin you like, Best Beloved. Sometimes the fingers&#10;slipped and the marks got a little blurred; but if you look closely&#10;at any Leopard now you will see that there are always five&#10;spots&#8212;off five fat black finger-tips.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Now you are a beauty!&#39; said the Ethiopian. &#39;You can lie out on&#10;the bare ground and look like a heap of pebbles. You can lie out on&#10;the naked rocks and look like a piece of pudding-stone. You can lie&#10;out on a leafy branch and look like sunshine sifting through the&#10;leaves; and you can lie right across the centre of a path and look&#10;like nothing in particular. Think of that and purr!&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;But if I&#39;m all this,&#39; said the Leopard, &#39;why didn&#39;t you go&#10;spotty too?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Oh, plain black&#39;s best for a nigger,&#39; said the Ethiopian. &#39;Now&#10;come along and we&#39;ll see if we can&#39;t get even with Mr.&#10;One-Two-Three Where&#39;s your Breakfast!&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So they went away and lived happily ever afterward, Best&#10;Beloved. That is all.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Oh, now and then you will hear grown-ups say, &#39;Can the Ethiopian&#10;change his skin or the Leopard his spots?&#39; I don&#39;t think even&#10;grown-ups would keep on saying such a silly thing if the Leopard&#10;and the Ethiopian hadn&#39;t done it once&#8212;do you? But they will never&#10;do it again, Best Beloved. They are quite contented as they&#10;are.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I AM the Most Wise Baviaan, saying in most wise tones,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#39;Let us melt into the landscape&#8212;just us two by our lones.&#39;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;People have come&#8212;in a carriage&#8212;calling.

Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Elephant&#39;s Child'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;IN the High and Far-Off Times the Elephant, O Best Beloved, had&#10;no trunk. He had only a blackish, bulgy nose, as big as a boot,&#10;that he could wriggle about from side to side; but he couldn&#39;t pick&#10;up things with it. But there was one Elephant&#8212;a new Elephant&#8212;an&#10;Elephant&#39;s Child&#8212;who was full of &#39;satiable curtiosity, and that&#10;means he asked ever so many questions. And he lived in Africa, and&#10;he filled all Africa with his &#39;satiable curtiosities. He asked his&#10;tall aunt, the Ostrich, why her tail-feathers grew just so, and his&#10;tall aunt the Ostrich spanked him with her hard, hard claw. He&#10;asked his tall uncle, the Giraffe, what made his skin spotty, and&#10;his tall uncle, the Giraffe, spanked him with his hard, hard hoof.&#10;And still he was full of &#39;satiable curtiosity! He asked his broad&#10;aunt, the Hippopotamus, why her eyes were red, and his broad aunt,&#10;the Hippopotamus, spanked him with her broad, broad hoof; and he&#10;asked his hairy uncle, the Baboon, why melons tasted just so, and&#10;his hairy uncle, the Baboon, spanked him with his hairy, hairy paw.&#10;And still he was full of &#39;satiable curtiosity! He asked questions&#10;about everything that he saw, or heard, or felt, or smelt, or&#10;touched, and all his uncles and his aunts spanked him. And still he&#10;was full of &#39;satiable curtiosity!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;One fine morning in the middle of the Precession of the&#10;Equinoxes this &#39;satiable Elephant&#39;s Child asked a new fine question&#10;that he had never asked before. He asked, &#39;What does the Crocodile&#10;have for dinner?&#39; Then everybody said, &#39;Hush!&#39; in a loud and&#10;dretful tone, and they spanked him immediately and directly,&#10;without stopping, for a long time.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;By and by, when that was finished, he came upon Kolokolo Bird&#10;sitting in the middle of a wait-a-bit thorn-bush, and he said, &#39;My&#10;father has spanked me, and my mother has spanked me; all my aunts&#10;and uncles have spanked me for my &#39;satiable curtiosity; and still I&#10;want to know what the Crocodile has for dinner!&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then Kolokolo Bird said, with a mournful cry, &#39;Go to the banks&#10;of the great grey-green, greasy Limpopo River, all set about with&#10;fever-trees, and find out.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;That very next morning, when there was nothing left of the&#10;Equinoxes, because the Precession had preceded according to&#10;precedent, this &#39;satiable Elephant&#39;s Child took a hundred pounds of&#10;bananas (the little short red kind), and a hundred pounds of&#10;sugar-cane (the long purple kind), and seventeen melons (the&#10;greeny-crackly kind), and said to all his dear families, &#39;Goodbye.&#10;I am going to the great grey-green, greasy Limpopo River, all set&#10;about with fever-trees, to find out what the Crocodile has for&#10;dinner.&#39; And they all spanked him once more for luck, though he&#10;asked them most politely to stop.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then he went away, a little warm, but not at all astonished,&#10;eating melons, and throwing the rind about, because he could not&#10;pick it up.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He went from Graham&#39;s Town to Kimberley, and from Kimberley to&#10;Khama&#39;s Country, and from Khama&#39;s Country he went east by north,&#10;eating melons all the time, till at last he came to the banks of&#10;the great grey-green, greasy Limpopo River, all set about with&#10;fever-trees, precisely as Kolokolo Bird had said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now you must know and understand, O Best Beloved, that till that&#10;very week, and day, and hour, and minute, this &#39;satiable Elephant&#39;s&#10;Child had never seen a Crocodile, and did not know what one was&#10;like. It was all his &#39;satiable curtiosity.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The first thing that he found was a&#10;Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake curled round a rock.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;&#39;Scuse me,&#39; said the Elephant&#39;s Child most politely, &#39;but have&#10;you seen such a thing as a Crocodile in these promiscuous&#10;parts?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Have I seen a Crocodile?&#39; said the&#10;Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake, in a voice of dretful scorn. &#39;What&#10;will you ask me next?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;&#39;Scuse me,&#39; said the Elephant&#39;s Child, &#39;but could you kindly&#10;tell me what he has for dinner?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake uncoiled himself very&#10;quickly from the rock, and spanked the Elephant&#39;s Child with his&#10;scalesome, flailsome tail.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;That is odd,&#39; said the Elephant&#39;s Child, &#39;because my father and&#10;my mother, and my uncle and my aunt, not to mention my other aunt,&#10;the Hippopotamus, and my other uncle, the Baboon, have all spanked&#10;me for my &#39;satiable curtiosity&#8212;and I suppose this is the same&#10;thing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So he said good-bye very politely to the&#10;Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake, and helped to coil him up on the&#10;rock again, and went on, a little warm, but not at all astonished,&#10;eating melons, and throwing the rind about, because he could not&#10;pick it up, till he trod on what he thought was a log of wood at&#10;the very edge of the great grey-green, greasy Limpopo River, all&#10;set about with fever-trees.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But it was really the Crocodile, O Best Beloved, and the&#10;Crocodile winked one eye&#8212;like this!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;&#39;Scuse me,&#39; said the Elephant&#39;s Child most politely, &#39;but do&#10;you happen to have seen a Crocodile in these promiscuous&#10;parts?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then the Crocodile winked the other eye, and lifted half his&#10;tail out of the mud; and the Elephant&#39;s Child stepped back most&#10;politely, because he did not wish to be spanked again.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Come hither, Little One,&#39; said the Crocodile. &#39;Why do you ask&#10;such things?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;&#39;Scuse me,&#39; said the Elephant&#39;s Child most politely, &#39;but my&#10;father has spanked me, my mother has spanked me, not to mention my&#10;tall aunt, the Ostrich, and my tall uncle, the Giraffe, who can&#10;kick ever so hard, as well as my broad aunt, the Hippopotamus, and&#10;my hairy uncle, the Baboon, and including the&#10;Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake, with the scalesome, flailsome tail,&#10;just up the bank, who spanks harder than any of them; and so, if&#10;it&#39;s quite all the same to you, I don&#39;t want to be spanked any&#10;more.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Come hither, Little One,&#39; said the Crocodile, &#39;for I am the&#10;Crocodile,&#39; and he wept crocodile-tears to show it was quite&#10;true.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then the Elephant&#39;s Child grew all breathless, and panted, and&#10;kneeled down on the bank and said, &#39;You are the very person I have&#10;been looking for all these long days. Will you please tell me what&#10;you have for dinner?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Come hither, Little One,&#39; said the Crocodile, &#39;and I&#39;ll&#10;whisper.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then the Elephant&#39;s Child put his head down close to the&#10;Crocodile&#39;s musky, tusky mouth, and the Crocodile caught him by his&#10;little nose, which up to that very week, day, hour, and minute, had&#10;been no bigger than a boot, though much more useful.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;I think, said the Crocodile&#8212;and he said it between his teeth,&#10;like this&#8212;&#39;I think to-day I will begin with Elephant&#39;s Child!&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At this, O Best Beloved, the Elephant&#39;s Child was much annoyed,&#10;and he said, speaking through his nose, like this, &#39;Led go! You are&#10;hurtig be!&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake scuffled down from the&#10;bank and said, &#39;My young friend, if you do not now, immediately and&#10;instantly, pull as hard as ever you can, it is my opinion that your&#10;acquaintance in the large-pattern leather ulster&#39; (and by this he&#10;meant the Crocodile) &#39;will jerk you into yonder limpid stream&#10;before you can say Jack Robinson.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;This is the way Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snakes always talk.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then the Elephant&#39;s Child sat back on his little haunches, and&#10;pulled, and pulled, and pulled, and his nose began to stretch. And&#10;the Crocodile floundered into the water, making it all creamy with&#10;great sweeps of his tail, and he pulled, and pulled, and&#10;pulled.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And the Elephant&#39;s Child&#39;s nose kept on stretching; and the&#10;Elephant&#39;s Child spread all his little four legs and pulled, and&#10;pulled, and pulled, and his nose kept on stretching; and the&#10;Crocodile threshed his tail like an oar, and he pulled, and pulled,&#10;and pulled, and at each pull the Elephant&#39;s Child&#39;s nose grew&#10;longer and longer&#8212;and it hurt him hijjus!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then the Elephant&#39;s Child felt his legs slipping, and he said&#10;through his nose, which was now nearly five feet long, &#39;This is too&#10;butch for be!&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake came down from the bank,&#10;and knotted himself in a double-clove-hitch round the Elephant&#39;s&#10;Child&#39;s hind legs, and said, &#39;Rash and inexperienced traveller, we&#10;will now seriously devote ourselves to a little high tension,&#10;because if we do not, it is my impression that yonder&#10;self-propelling man-of-war with the armour-plated upper deck&#39; (and&#10;by this, O Best Beloved, he meant the Crocodile), &#39;will permanently&#10;vitiate your future career.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;That is the way all Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snakes always&#10;talk.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So he pulled, and the Elephant&#39;s Child pulled, and the Crocodile&#10;pulled; but the Elephant&#39;s Child and the&#10;Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake pulled hardest; and at last the&#10;Crocodile let go of the Elephant&#39;s Child&#39;s nose with a plop that&#10;you could hear all up and down the Limpopo.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then the Elephant&#39;s Child sat down most hard and sudden; but&#10;first he was careful to say &#39;Thank you&#39; to the&#10;Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake; and next he was kind to his poor&#10;pulled nose, and wrapped it all up in cool banana leaves, and hung&#10;it in the great grey-green, greasy Limpopo to cool.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;What are you doing that for?&#39; said the&#10;Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;&#39;Scuse me,&#39; said the Elephant&#39;s Child, &#39;but my nose is badly&#10;out of shape, and I am waiting for it to shrink.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Then you will have to wait a long time, said the&#10;Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake. &#39;Some people do not know what is&#10;good for them.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Elephant&#39;s Child sat there for three days waiting for his&#10;nose to shrink. But it never grew any shorter, and, besides, it&#10;made him squint. For, O Best Beloved, you will see and understand&#10;that the Crocodile had pulled it out into a really truly trunk same&#10;as all Elephants have to-day.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At the end of the third day a fly came and stung him on the&#10;shoulder, and before he knew what he was doing he lifted up his&#10;trunk and hit that fly dead with the end of it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;&#39;Vantage number one!&#39; said the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake.&#10;&#39;You couldn&#39;t have done that with a mere-smear nose. Try and eat a&#10;little now.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Before he thought what he was doing the Elephant&#39;s Child put out&#10;his trunk and plucked a large bundle of grass, dusted it clean&#10;against his fore-legs, and stuffed it into his own mouth.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Vantage number two!&#39; said the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake.&#10;&#39;You couldn&#39;t have done that with a mear-smear nose. Don&#39;t you&#10;think the sun is very hot here?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;It is,&#39; said the Elephant&#39;s Child, and before he thought what&#10;he was doing he schlooped up a schloop of mud from the banks of the&#10;great grey-green, greasy Limpopo, and slapped it on his head, where&#10;it made a cool schloopy-sloshy mud-cap all trickly behind his&#10;ears.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Vantage number three!&#39; said the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake.&#10;&#39;You couldn&#39;t have done that with a mere-smear nose. Now how do you&#10;feel about being spanked again?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;&#39;Scuse me,&#39; said the Elephant&#39;s Child, &#39;but I should not like&#10;it at all.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;How would you like to spank somebody?&#39; said the&#10;Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;I should like it very much indeed,&#39; said the Elephant&#39;s&#10;Child.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Well,&#39; said the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake, &#39;you will find&#10;that new nose of yours very useful to spank people with.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Thank you,&#39; said the Elephant&#39;s Child, &#39;I&#39;ll remember that; and&#10;now I think I&#39;ll go home to all my dear families and try.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So the Elephant&#39;s Child went home across Africa frisking and&#10;whisking his trunk. When he wanted fruit to eat he pulled fruit&#10;down from a tree, instead of waiting for it to fall as he used to&#10;do. When he wanted grass he plucked grass up from the ground,&#10;instead of going on his knees as he used to do. When the flies bit&#10;him he broke off the branch of a tree and used it as fly-whisk; and&#10;he made himself a new, cool, slushy-squshy mud-cap whenever the sun&#10;was hot. When he felt lonely walking through Africa he sang to&#10;himself down his trunk, and the noise was louder than several brass&#10;bands.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He went especially out of his way to find a broad Hippopotamus&#10;(she was no relation of his), and he spanked her very hard, to make&#10;sure that the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake had spoken the truth&#10;about his new trunk. The rest of the time he picked up the melon&#10;rinds that he had dropped on his way to the Limpopo&#8212;for he was a&#10;Tidy Pachyderm.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;One dark evening he came back to all his dear families, and he&#10;coiled up his trunk and said, &#39;How do you do?&#39; They were very glad&#10;to see him, and immediately said, &#39;Come here and be spanked for&#10;your &#39;satiable curtiosity.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Pooh,&#39; said the Elephant&#39;s Child. &#39;I don&#39;t think you peoples&#10;know anything about spanking; but I do, and I&#39;ll show you.&#39; Then he&#10;uncurled his trunk and knocked two of his dear brothers head over&#10;heels.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;O Bananas!&#39; said they, &#39;where did you learn that trick, and&#10;what have you done to your nose?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;I got a new one from the Crocodile on the banks of the great&#10;grey-green, greasy Limpopo River,&#39; said the Elephant&#39;s Child. &#39;I&#10;asked him what he had for dinner, and he gave me this to keep.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;It looks very ugly,&#39; said his hairy uncle, the Baboon.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;It does,&#39; said the Elephant&#39;s Child. &#39;But it&#39;s very useful,&#39;&#10;and he picked up his hairy uncle, the Baboon, by one hairy leg, and&#10;hove him into a hornet&#39;s nest.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then that bad Elephant&#39;s Child spanked all his dear families for&#10;a long time, till they were very warm and greatly astonished. He&#10;pulled out his tall Ostrich aunt&#39;s tail-feathers; and he caught his&#10;tall uncle, the Giraffe, by the hind-leg, and dragged him through a&#10;thorn-bush; and he shouted at his broad aunt, the Hippopotamus, and&#10;blew bubbles into her ear when she was sleeping in the water after&#10;meals; but he never let any one touch Kolokolo Bird.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At last things grew so exciting that his dear families went off&#10;one by one in a hurry to the banks of the great grey-green, greasy&#10;Limpopo River, all set about with fever-trees, to borrow new noses&#10;from the Crocodile. When they came back nobody spanked anybody any&#10;more; and ever since that day, O Best Beloved, all the Elephants&#10;you will ever see, besides all those that you won&#39;t, have trunks&#10;precisely like the trunk of the &#39;satiable Elephant&#39;s Child.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I Keep six honest serving-men:&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;(They taught me all I knew)&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Their names are What and Where and When&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;And How and Why and Who.&#60;br /&#62;&#10;I send them over land and sea,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;I send them east and west;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;But after they have worked for me,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;I give them all a rest.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I let them rest from nine till five.&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;For I am busy then,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;As well as breakfast, lunch, and tea,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;For they are hungry men:&#60;br /&#62;&#10;But different folk have different views:&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;I know a person small&#8212;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;She keeps ten million serving-men,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;Who get no rest at all!&#60;br /&#62;&#10;She sends &#39;em abroad on her own affairs,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;From the second she opens her eyes&#8212;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;One million Hows, two million Wheres,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;And seven million Whys!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 10, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/865', :deleted => 0)

He was grey and he was&#10;woolly, and his pride was inordinate: he danced on an outcrop in&#10;the middle of Australia, and he went to the Little God Nqa.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He went to Nqa at six before breakfast, saying, &#39;Make me&#10;different from all other animals by five this afternoon.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Up jumped Nqa from his seat on the sandflat and shouted, &#39;Go&#10;away!&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He was grey and he was woolly, and his pride was inordinate: he&#10;danced on a rock-ledge in the middle of Australia, and he went to&#10;the Middle God Nquing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He went to Nquing at eight after breakfast, saying, &#39;Make me&#10;different from all other animals; make me, also, wonderfully&#10;popular by five this afternoon.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Up jumped Nquing from his burrow in the spinifex and shouted,&#10;&#39;Go away!&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He was grey and he was woolly, and his pride was inordinate: he&#10;danced on a sandbank in the middle of Australia, and he went to the&#10;Big God Nqong.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He went to Nqong at ten before dinner-time, saying, &#39;Make me&#10;different from all other animals; make me popular and wonderfully&#10;run after by five this afternoon.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Up jumped Nqong from his bath in the salt-pan and shouted, &#39;Yes,&#10;I will!&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Nqong called Dingo&#8212;Yellow-Dog Dingo&#8212;always hungry, dusty in the&#10;sunshine, and showed him Kangaroo. Nqong said, &#39;Dingo! Wake up,&#10;Dingo! Do you see that gentleman dancing on an ashpit? He wants to&#10;be popular and very truly run after. Dingo, make him SO!&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Up jumped Dingo&#8212;Yellow-Dog Dingo&#8212;and said, &#39;What, that&#10;cat-rabbit?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Off ran Dingo&#8212;Yellow-Dog Dingo&#8212;always hungry, grinning like a&#10;coal-scuttle,&#8212;ran after Kangaroo.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Off went the proud Kangaroo on his four little legs like a&#10;bunny.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;This, O Beloved of mine, ends the first part of the tale!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He ran through the desert; he ran through the mountains; he ran&#10;through the salt-pans; he ran through the reed-beds; he ran through&#10;the blue gums; he ran through the spinifex; he ran till his front&#10;legs ached.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He had to!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Still ran Dingo&#8212;Yellow-Dog Dingo&#8212;always hungry, grinning like a&#10;rat-trap, never getting nearer, never getting farther,&#8212;ran after&#10;Kangaroo.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He had to!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Still ran Kangaroo&#8212;Old Man Kangaroo. He ran through the&#10;ti-trees; he ran through the mulga; he ran through the long grass;&#10;he ran through the short grass; he ran through the Tropics of&#10;Capricorn and Cancer; he ran till his hind legs ached.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He had to!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Still ran Dingo&#8212;Yellow-Dog Dingo&#8212;hungrier and hungrier, grinning&#10;like a horse-collar, never getting nearer, never getting farther;&#10;and they came to the Wollgong River.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now, there wasn&#39;t any bridge, and there wasn&#39;t any ferry-boat,&#10;and Kangaroo didn&#39;t know how to get over; so he stood on his legs&#10;and hopped.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He had to!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He hopped through the Flinders; he hopped through the Cinders;&#10;he hopped through the deserts in the middle of Australia. He hopped&#10;like a Kangaroo.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;First he hopped one yard; then he hopped three yards; then he&#10;hopped five yards; his legs growing stronger; his legs growing&#10;longer. He hadn&#39;t any time for rest or refreshment, and he wanted&#10;them very much.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Still ran Dingo&#8212;Yellow-Dog Dingo&#8212;very much bewildered, very much&#10;hungry, and wondering what in the world or out of it made Old Man&#10;Kangaroo hop.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For he hopped like a cricket; like a pea in a saucepan; or a new&#10;rubber ball on a nursery floor.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He had to!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He tucked up his front legs; he hopped on his hind legs; he&#10;stuck out his tail for a balance-weight behind him; and he hopped&#10;through the Darling Downs.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He had to!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Still ran Dingo&#8212;Tired-Dog Dingo&#8212;hungrier and hungrier, very much&#10;bewildered, and wondering when in the world or out of it would Old&#10;Man Kangaroo stop.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then came Nqong from his bath in the salt-pans, and said, &#39;It&#39;s&#10;five o&#39;clock.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Down sat Dingo&#8212;Poor Dog Dingo&#8212;always hungry, dusky in the&#10;sunshine; hung out his tongue and howled.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Down sat Kangaroo&#8212;Old Man Kangaroo&#8212;stuck out his tail like a&#10;milking-stool behind him, and said, &#39;Thank goodness that&#39;s&#10;finished!&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then said Nqong, who is always a gentleman, &#39;Why aren&#39;t you&#10;grateful to Yellow-Dog Dingo? Why don&#39;t you thank him for all he&#10;has done for you?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then said Kangaroo&#8212;Tired Old Kangaroo&#8212;He&#39;s chased me out of the&#10;homes of my childhood; he&#39;s chased me out of my regular meal-times;&#10;he&#39;s altered my shape so I&#39;ll never get it back; and he&#39;s played&#10;Old Scratch with my legs.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then said Nqong, &#39;Perhaps I&#39;m mistaken, but didn&#39;t you ask me to&#10;make you different from all other animals, as well as to make you&#10;very truly sought after? And now it is five o&#39;clock.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Yes,&#39; said Kangaroo. &#39;I wish that I hadn&#39;t. I thought you would&#10;do it by charms and incantations, but this is a practical&#10;joke.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Joke!&#39; said Nqong from his bath in the blue gums. &#39;Say that&#10;again and I&#39;ll whistle up Dingo and run your hind legs off.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;No,&#39; said the Kangaroo. &#39;I must apologise. Legs are legs, and&#10;you needn&#39;t alter &#39;em so far as I am concerned. I only meant to&#10;explain to Your Lordliness that I&#39;ve had nothing to eat since&#10;morning, and I&#39;m very empty indeed.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Yes,&#39; said Dingo&#8212;Yellow-Dog Dingo,&#8212;&#39;I am just in the same&#10;situation. I&#39;ve made him different from all other animals; but what&#10;may I have for my tea?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then said Nqong from his bath in the salt-pan, &#39;Come and ask me&#10;about it tomorrow, because I&#39;m going to wash.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So they were left in the middle of Australia, Old Man Kangaroo&#10;and Yellow-Dog Dingo, and each said, &#39;That&#39;s your fault.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;THIS is the mouth-filling song&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Of the race that was run by a Boomer,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Run in a single burst&#8212;only event of its kind&#8212;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Started by big God Nqong from Warrigaborrigarooma,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Old Man Kangaroo first: Yellow-Dog Dingo behind.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Kangaroo bounded away,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;His back-legs working like pistons&#8212;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Bounded from morning till dark,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Twenty-five feet to a bound.&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Yellow-Dog Dingo lay&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Like a yellow cloud in the distance&#8212;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Much too busy to bark.&#60;br /&#62;&#10;My! but they covered the ground!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Nobody knows where they went,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Or followed the track that they flew in,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;For that Continent&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Hadn&#39;t been given a name.&#60;br /&#62;&#10;They ran thirty degrees,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;From Torres Straits to the Leeuwin&#60;br /&#62;&#10;(Look at the Atlas, please),&#60;br /&#62;&#10;And they ran back as they came.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;S&#39;posing you could trot&#60;br /&#62;&#10;From Adelaide to the Pacific,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;For an afternoon&#39;s run&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Half what these gentlemen did&#60;br /&#62;&#10;You would feel rather hot,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;But your legs would develop terrific&#8212;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Yes, my importunate son,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;You&#39;d be a Marvellous Kid!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 10, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/865', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Beginning of the Armadillos'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;THIS, O Best Beloved, is another story of the High and Far-Off&#10;Times. In the very middle of those times was a Stickly-Prickly&#10;Hedgehog, and he lived on the banks of the turbid Amazon, eating&#10;shelly snails and things. And he had a friend, a Slow-Solid&#10;Tortoise, who lived on the banks of the turbid Amazon, eating green&#10;lettuces and things. And so that was all right, Best Beloved. Do&#10;you see?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But also, and at the same time, in those High and Far-Off Times,&#10;there was a Painted Jaguar, and he lived on the banks of the turbid&#10;Amazon too; and he ate everything that he could catch. When he&#10;could not catch deer or monkeys he would eat frogs and beetles; and&#10;when he could not catch frogs and beetles he went to his Mother&#10;Jaguar, and she told him how to eat hedgehogs and tortoises.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She said to him ever so many times, graciously waving her tail,&#10;&#39;My son, when you find a Hedgehog you must drop him into the water&#10;and then he will uncoil, and when you catch a Tortoise you must&#10;scoop him out of his shell with your paw.&#39; And so that was all&#10;right, Best Beloved.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;One beautiful night on the banks of the turbid Amazon, Painted&#10;Jaguar found Stickly-Prickly Hedgehog and Slow-Solid Tortoise&#10;sitting under the trunk of a fallen tree. They could not run away,&#10;and so Stickly-Prickly curled himself up into a ball, because he&#10;was a Hedgehog, and Slow-Solid Tortoise drew in his head and feet&#10;into his shell as far as they would go, because he was a Tortoise;&#10;and so that was all right, Best Beloved. Do you see?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Now attend to me,&#39; said Painted Jaguar, &#39;because this is very&#10;important. My mother said that when I meet a Hedgehog I am to drop&#10;him into the water and then he will uncoil, and when I meet a&#10;Tortoise I am to scoop him out of his shell with my paw. Now which&#10;of you is Hedgehog and which is Tortoise? because, to save my&#10;spots, I can&#39;t tell.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Are you sure of what your Mummy told you?&#39; said Stickly-Prickly&#10;Hedgehog. &#39;Are you quite sure? Perhaps she said that when you&#10;uncoil a Tortoise you must shell him out the water with a scoop,&#10;and when you paw a Hedgehog you must drop him on the shell.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Are you sure of what your Mummy told you?&#39; said Slow-and-Solid&#10;Tortoise. &#39;Are you quite sure? Perhaps she said that when you water&#10;a Hedgehog you must drop him into your paw, and when you meet a&#10;Tortoise you must shell him till he uncoils.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;I don&#39;t think it was at all like that,&#39; said Painted Jaguar,&#10;but he felt a little puzzled; &#39;but, please, say it again more&#10;distinctly.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;When you scoop water with your paw you uncoil it with a&#10;Hedgehog,&#39; said Stickly-Prickly. &#39;Remember that, because it&#39;s&#10;important.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;But,&#39; said the Tortoise, &#39;when you paw your meat you drop it&#10;into a Tortoise with a scoop. Why can&#39;t you understand?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;You are making my spots ache,&#39; said Painted Jaguar; &#39;and&#10;besides, I didn&#39;t want your advice at all. I only wanted to know&#10;which of you is Hedgehog and which is Tortoise.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;I shan&#39;t tell you,&#39; said Stickly-Prickly, &#39;but you can scoop me&#10;out of my shell if you like.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Aha!&#39; said Painted Jaguar. &#39;Now I know you&#39;re Tortoise. You&#10;thought I wouldn&#39;t! Now I will.&#39; Painted Jaguar darted out his&#10;paddy-paw just as Stickly-Prickly curled himself up, and of course&#10;Jaguar&#39;s paddy-paw was just filled with prickles. Worse than that,&#10;he knocked Stickly-Prickly away and away into the woods and the&#10;bushes, where it was too dark to find him. Then he put his&#10;paddy-paw into his mouth, and of course the prickles hurt him worse&#10;than ever. As soon as he could speak he said, &#39;Now I know he isn&#39;t&#10;Tortoise at all. But&#39;&#8212;and then he scratched his head with his&#10;un-prickly paw&#8212;&#39;how do I know that this other is Tortoise?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;But I am Tortoise,&#39; said Slow-and-Solid. Your mother was quite&#10;right. She said that you were to scoop me out of my shell with your&#10;paw. Begin.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;You didn&#39;t say she said that a minute ago, said Painted Jaguar,&#10;sucking the prickles out of his paddy-paw. &#39;You said she said&#10;something quite different.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Well, suppose you say that I said that she said something quite&#10;different, I don&#39;t see that it makes any difference; because if she&#10;said what you said I said she said, it&#39;s just the same as if I said&#10;what she said she said. On the other hand, if you think she said&#10;that you were to uncoil me with a scoop, instead of pawing me into&#10;drops with a shell, I can&#39;t help that, can I?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;But you said you wanted to be scooped out of your shell with my&#10;paw,&#39; said Painted Jaguar.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;If you&#39;ll think again you&#39;ll find that I didn&#39;t say anything of&#10;the kind. I said that your mother said that you were to scoop me&#10;out of my shell,&#39; said Slow-and-Solid.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;What will happen if I do?&#39; said the Jaguar most sniffily and&#10;most cautious.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;I don&#39;t know, because I&#39;ve never been scooped out of my shell&#10;before; but I tell you truly, if you want to see me swim away&#10;you&#39;ve only got to drop me into the water.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;I don&#39;t believe it,&#39; said Painted Jaguar. &#39;You&#39;ve mixed up all&#10;the things my mother told me to do with the things that you asked&#10;me whether I was sure that she didn&#39;t say, till I don&#39;t know&#10;whether I&#39;m on my head or my painted tail; and now you come and&#10;tell me something I can understand, and it makes me more mixy than&#10;before. My mother told me that I was to drop one of you two into&#10;the water, and as you seem so anxious to be dropped I think you&#10;don&#39;t want to be dropped. So jump into the turbid Amazon and be&#10;quick about it.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;I warn you that your Mummy won&#39;t be pleased. Don&#39;t tell her I&#10;didn&#39;t tell you,&#39; said Slow-Solid.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;If you say another word about what my mother said&#8212;&#39; the Jaguar&#10;answered, but he had not finished the sentence before&#10;Slow-and-Solid quietly dived into the turbid Amazon, swam under&#10;water for a long way, and came out on the bank where&#10;Stickly-Prickly was waiting for him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;That was a very narrow escape,&#39; said Stickly-Prickly. &#39;I don&#39;t&#10;rib Painted Jaguar. What did you tell him that you were?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;I told him truthfully that I was a truthful Tortoise, but he&#10;wouldn&#39;t believe it, and he made me jump into the river to see if I&#10;was, and I was, and he is surprised. Now he&#39;s gone to tell his&#10;Mummy. Listen to him!&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;They could hear Painted Jaguar roaring up and down among the&#10;trees and the bushes by the side of the turbid Amazon, till his&#10;Mummy came.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Son, son!&#39; said his mother ever so many times, graciously&#10;waving her tail, &#39;what have you been doing that you shouldn&#39;t have&#10;done?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;I tried to scoop something that said it wanted to be scooped&#10;out of its shell with my paw, and my paw is full of per-ickles,&#39;&#10;said Painted Jaguar.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Son, son!&#39; said his mother ever so many times, graciously&#10;waving her tail, &#39;by the prickles in your paddy-paw I see that that&#10;must have been a Hedgehog. You should have dropped him into the&#10;water.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;I did that to the other thing; and he said he was a Tortoise,&#10;and I didn&#39;t believe him, and it was quite true, and he has dived&#10;under the turbid Amazon, and he won&#39;t come up again, and I haven&#39;t&#10;anything at all to eat, and I think we had better find lodgings&#10;somewhere else. They are too clever on the turbid Amazon for poor&#10;me!&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Son, son!&#39; said his mother ever so many times, graciously&#10;waving her tail, &#39;now attend to me and remember what I say. A&#10;Hedgehog curls himself up into a ball and his prickles stick out&#10;every which way at once. By this you may know the Hedgehog.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;I don&#39;t like this old lady one little bit,&#39; said&#10;Stickly-Prickly, under the shadow of a large leaf. &#39;I wonder what&#10;else she knows?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;A Tortoise can&#39;t curl himself up,&#39; Mother Jaguar went on, ever&#10;so many times, graciously waving her tail. &#39;He only draws his head&#10;and legs into his shell. By this you may know the tortoise.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;I don&#39;t like this old lady at all&#8212;at all,&#39; said Slow-and-Solid&#10;Tortoise. &#39;Even Painted Jaguar can&#39;t forget those directions. It&#39;s&#10;a great pity that you can&#39;t swim, Stickly-Prickly.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Don&#39;t talk to me,&#39; said Stickly-Prickly. &#39;Just think how much&#10;better it would be if you could curl up. This is a mess! Listen to&#10;Painted Jaguar.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Painted Jaguar was sitting on the banks of the turbid Amazon&#10;sucking prickles out of his Paws and saying to himself&#8212;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Can&#39;t curl, but can swim&#8212;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Slow-Solid, that&#39;s him!&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Curls up, but can&#39;t swim&#8212;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Stickly-Prickly, that&#39;s him!&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;He&#39;ll never forget that this month of Sundays,&#39; said&#10;Stickly-Prickly. &#39;Hold up my chin, Slow-and-Solid. I&#39;m going to try&#10;to learn to swim. It may be useful.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Excellent!&#39; said Slow-and-Solid; and he held up&#10;Stickly-Prickly&#39;s chin, while Stickly-Prickly kicked in the waters&#10;of the turbid Amazon.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;You&#39;ll make a fine swimmer yet,&#39; said Slow-and-Solid. &#39;Now, if&#10;you can unlace my back-plates a little, I&#39;ll see what I can do&#10;towards curling up. It may be useful.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Stickly-Prickly helped to unlace Tortoise&#39;s back-plates, so that&#10;by twisting and straining Slow-and-Solid actually managed to curl&#10;up a tiddy wee bit.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Excellent!&#39; said Stickly-Prickly; &#39;but I shouldn&#39;t do any more&#10;just now. It&#39;s making you black in the face. Kindly lead me into&#10;the water once again and I&#39;ll practice that side-stroke which you&#10;say is so easy.&#39; And so Stickly-Prickly practiced, and Slow-Solid&#10;swam alongside.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Excellent!&#39; said Slow-and-Solid. &#39;A little more practice will&#10;make you a regular whale. Now, if I may trouble you to unlace my&#10;back and front plates two holes more, I&#39;ll try that fascinating&#10;bend that you say is so easy. Won&#39;t Painted Jaguar be&#10;surprised!&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Excellent!&#39; said Stickly-Prickly, all wet from the turbid&#10;Amazon. &#39;I declare, I shouldn&#39;t know you from one of my own family.&#10;Two holes, I think, you said? A little more expression, please, and&#10;don&#39;t grunt quite so much, or Painted Jaguar may hear us. When&#10;you&#39;ve finished, I want to try that long dive which you say is so&#10;easy. Won&#39;t Painted Jaguar be surprised!&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And so Stickly-Prickly dived, and Slow-and-Solid dived&#10;alongside.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Excellent!&#39; said Slow-and-Solid. &#39;A leetle more attention to&#10;holding your breath and you will be able to keep house at the&#10;bottom of the turbid Amazon. Now I&#39;ll try that exercise of putting&#10;my hind legs round my ears which you say is so peculiarly&#10;comfortable. Won&#39;t Painted Jaguar be surprised!&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Excellent!&#39; said Stickly-Prickly. &#39;But it&#39;s straining your&#10;back-plates a little. They are all overlapping now, instead of&#10;lying side by side.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Oh, that&#39;s the result of exercise,&#39; said Slow-and-Solid. &#39;I&#39;ve&#10;noticed that your prickles seem to be melting into one another, and&#10;that you&#39;re growing to look rather more like a pinecone, and less&#10;like a chestnut-burr, than you used to.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Am I?&#39; said Stickly-Prickly. &#39;That comes from my soaking in the&#10;water. Oh, won&#39;t Painted Jaguar be surprised!&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;They went on with their exercises, each helping the other, till&#10;morning came; and when the sun was high they rested and dried&#10;themselves. Then they saw that they were both of them quite&#10;different from what they had been.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Stickly-Prickly,&#39; said Tortoise after breakfast, &#39;I am not what&#10;I was yesterday; but I think that I may yet amuse Painted&#10;Jaguar.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;That was the very thing I was thinking just now,&#39; said&#10;Stickly-Prickly. &#39;I think scales are a tremendous improvement on&#10;prickles&#8212;to say nothing of being able to swim. Oh, won&#39;t Painted&#10;Jaguar be surprised! Let&#39;s go and find him.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;By and by they found Painted Jaguar, still nursing his paddy-paw&#10;that had been hurt the night before. He was so astonished that he&#10;fell three times backward over his own painted tail without&#10;stopping.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Good morning!&#39; said Stickly-Prickly. &#39;And how is your dear&#10;gracious Mummy this morning?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;She is quite well, thank you,&#39; said Painted Jaguar; &#39;but you&#10;must forgive me if I do not at this precise moment recall your&#10;name.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;That&#39;s unkind of you,&#39; said Stickly-Prickly, &#39;seeing that this&#10;time yesterday you tried to scoop me out of my shell with your&#10;paw.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;But you hadn&#39;t any shell. It was all prickles,&#39; said Painted&#10;Jaguar. &#39;I know it was. Just look at my paw!&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;You told me to drop into the turbid Amazon and be drowned,&#39;&#10;said Slow-Solid. &#39;Why are you so rude and forgetful to-day?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Don&#39;t you remember what your mother told you?&#39; said&#10;Stickly-Prickly,&#8212;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Can&#39;t curl, but can swim&#8212;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Stickly-Prickly, that&#39;s him!&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Curls up, but can&#39;t swim&#8212;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Slow-Solid, that&#39;s him!&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then they both curled themselves up and rolled round and round&#10;Painted Jaguar till his eyes turned truly cart-wheels in his&#10;head.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then he went to fetch his mother.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Mother,&#39; he said, &#39;there are two new animals in the woods&#10;to-day, and the one that you said couldn&#39;t swim, swims, and the one&#10;that you said couldn&#39;t curl up, curls; and they&#39;ve gone shares in&#10;their prickles, I think, because both of them are scaly all over,&#10;instead of one being smooth and the other very prickly; and,&#10;besides that, they are rolling round and round in circles, and I&#10;don&#39;t feel comfy.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Son, son!&#39; said Mother Jaguar ever so many times, graciously&#10;waving her tail, &#39;a Hedgehog is a Hedgehog, and can&#39;t be anything&#10;but a Hedgehog; and a Tortoise is a Tortoise, and can never be&#10;anything else.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;But it isn&#39;t a Hedgehog, and it isn&#39;t a Tortoise. It&#39;s a little&#10;bit of both, and I don&#39;t know its proper name.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Nonsense!&#39; said Mother Jaguar. &#39;Everything has its proper name.&#10;I should call it &#34;Armadillo&#34; till I found out the real one. And I&#10;should leave it alone.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So Painted Jaguar did as he was told, especially about leaving&#10;them alone; but the curious thing is that from that day to this, O&#10;Best Beloved, no one on the banks of the turbid Amazon has ever&#10;called Stickly-Prickly and Slow-Solid anything except Armadillo.&#10;There are Hedgehogs and Tortoises in other places, of course (there&#10;are some in my garden); but the real old and clever kind, with&#10;their scales lying lippety-lappety one over the other, like&#10;pine-cone scales, that lived on the banks of the turbid Amazon in&#10;the High and Far-Off Days, are always called Armadillos, because&#10;they were so clever.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So that; all right, Best Beloved. Do you see?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I&#39;VE never sailed the Amazon,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;I&#39;ve never reached Brazil;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;But the Don and Magdelana,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;They can go there when they will!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#38;#160; &#38;#160; &#38;#160;Yes, weekly from Southampton,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160; &#38;#160; &#38;#160;Great steamers, white and gold,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160; &#38;#160; &#38;#160;Go rolling down to Rio&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160; &#38;#160; &#38;#160;(Roll down&#8212;roll down to Rio!)&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160; &#38;#160; &#38;#160;And I&#39;d like to roll to Rio&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160; &#38;#160; &#38;#160;Some day before I&#39;m old!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I&#39;ve never seen a Jaguar,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;Nor yet an Armadill&#60;br /&#62;&#10;O dilloing in his armour,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;And I s&#39;pose I never will,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#38;#160; &#38;#160; &#38;#160;Unless I go to Rio&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160; &#38;#160; &#38;#160;These wonders to behold&#8212;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160; &#38;#160; &#38;#160;Roll down&#8212;roll down to Rio&#8212;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160; &#38;#160; &#38;#160;Roll really down to Rio!&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160; &#38;#160; &#38;#160;Oh, I&#39;d love to roll to Rio&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160; &#38;#160; &#38;#160;Some day before I&#39;m old!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 10, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/865', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;How the First Letter was Written'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;ONCE upon a most early time was a Neolithic man. He was not a&#10;Jute or an Angle, or even a Dravidian, which he might well have&#10;been, Best Beloved, but never mind why. He was a Primitive, and he&#10;lived cavily in a Cave, and he wore very few clothes, and he&#10;couldn&#39;t read and he couldn&#39;t write and he didn&#39;t want to, and&#10;except when he was hungry he was quite happy. His name was Tegumai&#10;Bopsulai, and that means,&#10;&#39;Man-who-does-not-put-his-foot-forward-in-a-hurry&#39;; but we, O Best&#10;Beloved, will call him Tegumai, for short. And his wife&#39;s name was&#10;Teshumai Tewindrow, and that means,&#10;&#39;Lady-who-asks-a-very-many-questions&#39;; but we, O Best Beloved, will&#10;call her Teshumai, for short. And his little girl-daughter&#39;s name&#10;was Taffimai Metallumai, and that means,&#10;&#39;Small-person-without-any-manners-who-ought-to-be-spanked&#39;; but I&#39;m&#10;going to call her Taffy. And she was Tegumai Bopsulai&#39;s Best&#10;Beloved and her own Mummy&#39;s Best Beloved, and she was not spanked&#10;half as much as was good for her; and they were all three very&#10;happy. As soon as Taffy could run about she went everywhere with&#10;her Daddy Tegumai, and sometimes they would not come home to the&#10;Cave till they were hungry, and then Teshumai Tewindrow would say,&#10;&#39;Where in the world have you two been to, to get so shocking dirty?&#10;Really, my Tegumai, you&#39;re no better than my Taffy.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now attend and listen!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;One day Tegumai Bopsulai went down through the beaver-swamp to&#10;the Wagai river to spear carp-fish for dinner, and Taffy went too.&#10;Tegumai&#39;s spear was made of wood with shark&#39;s teeth at the end, and&#10;before he had caught any fish at all he accidentally broke it clean&#10;across by jabbing it down too hard on the bottom of the river. They&#10;were miles and miles from home (of course they had their lunch with&#10;them in a little bag), and Tegumai had forgotten to bring any extra&#10;spears.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Here&#39;s a pretty kettle of fish!&#39; said Tegumai. &#39;It will take me&#10;half the day to mend this.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;There&#39;s your big black spear at home,&#39; said Taffy. &#39;Let me run&#10;back to the Cave and ask Mummy to give it me.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;It&#39;s too far for your little fat legs,&#39; said Tegumai. &#39;Besides,&#10;you might fall into the beaver-swamp and be drowned. We must make&#10;the best of a bad job.&#39; He sat down and took out a little leather&#10;mendy-bag, full of reindeer-sinews and strips of leather, and lumps&#10;of bee&#39;s-wax and resin, and began to mend the spear.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Taffy sat down too, with her toes in the water and her chin in&#10;her hand, and thought very hard. Then she said&#8212;&#39;I say, Daddy, it&#39;s&#10;an awful nuisance that you and I don&#39;t know how to write, isn&#39;t it?&#10;If we did we could send a message for the new spear.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Taffy,&#39; said Tegumai, &#39;how often have I told you not to use&#10;slang? &#34;Awful&#34; isn&#39;t a pretty word, but it could be a convenience,&#10;now you mention it, if we could write home.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Just then a Stranger-man came along the river, but he belonged&#10;to a far tribe, the Tewaras, and he did not understand one word of&#10;Tegumai&#39;s language. He stood on the bank and smiled at Taffy,&#10;because he had a little girl-daughter Of his own at home. Tegumai&#10;drew a hank of deer-sinews from his mendy-bag and began to mend his&#10;spear.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Come here, said Taffy. &#39;Do you know where my Mummy lives?&#39; And&#10;the Stranger-man said &#39;Um!&#39; being, as you know, a Tewara.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Silly!&#39; said Taffy, and she stamped her foot, because she saw a&#10;shoal of very big carp going up the river just when her Daddy&#10;couldn&#39;t use his spear.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Don&#39;t bother grown-ups,&#39; said Tegumai, so busy with his&#10;spear-mending that he did not turn round.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;I aren&#39;t, said Taffy. &#39;I only want him to do what I want him to&#10;do, and he won&#39;t understand.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Then don&#39;t bother me, said Tegumai, and he went on pulling and&#10;straining at the deer-sinews with his mouth full of loose ends. The&#10;Stranger-man&#8212;a genuine Tewara he was&#8212;sat down on the grass, and&#10;Taffy showed him what her Daddy was doing. The Stranger-man&#10;thought, this is a very wonderful child. She stamps her foot at me&#10;and she makes faces. She must be the daughter of that noble Chief&#10;who is so great that he won&#39;t take any notice of me.&#39; So he smiled&#10;more politely than ever.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Now,&#39; said Taffy, &#39;I want you to go to my Mummy, because your&#10;legs are longer than mine, and you won&#39;t fall into the&#10;beaver-swamp, and ask for Daddy&#39;s other spear&#8212;the one with the&#10;black handle that hangs over our fireplace.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Stranger-man (and he was a Tewara) thought, &#39;This is a very,&#10;very wonderful child. She waves her arms and she shouts at me, but&#10;I don&#39;t understand a word of what she says. But if I don&#39;t do what&#10;she wants, I greatly fear that that haughty Chief,&#10;Man-who-turns-his-back-on-callers, will be angry.&#39; He got up and&#10;twisted a big flat piece of bark off a birch-tree and gave it to&#10;Taffy. He did this, Best Beloved, to show that his heart was as&#10;white as the birch-bark and that he meant no harm; but Taffy didn&#39;t&#10;quite understand.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Oh!&#39; said she. &#39;Now I see! You want my Mummy&#39;s living-address?&#10;Of course I can&#39;t write, but I can draw pictures if I&#39;ve anything&#10;sharp to scratch with. Please lend me the shark&#39;s tooth off your&#10;necklace.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Stranger-man (and he was a Tewara) didn&#39;t say anything, So&#10;Taffy put up her little hand and pulled at the beautiful bead and&#10;seed and shark-tooth necklace round his neck.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Stranger-man (and he was a Tewara) thought, &#39;This is a very,&#10;very, very wonderful child. The shark&#39;s tooth on my necklace is a&#10;magic shark&#39;s tooth, and I was always told that if anybody touched&#10;it without my leave they would immediately swell up or burst, but&#10;this child doesn&#39;t swell up or burst, and that important Chief,&#10;Man-who-attends-strictly-to-his-business, who has not yet taken any&#10;notice of me at all, doesn&#39;t seem to be afraid that she will swell&#10;up or burst. I had better be more polite.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So he gave Taffy the shark&#39;s tooth, and she lay down flat on her&#10;tummy with her legs in the air, like some people on the&#10;drawing-room floor when they want to draw pictures, and she said,&#10;&#39;Now I&#39;ll draw you some beautiful pictures! You can look over my&#10;shoulder, but you mustn&#39;t joggle. First I&#39;ll draw Daddy fishing. It&#10;isn&#39;t very like him; but Mummy will know, because I&#39;ve drawn his&#10;spear all broken. Well, now I&#39;ll draw the other spear that he&#10;wants, the black-handled spear. It looks as if it was sticking in&#10;Daddy&#39;s back, but that&#39;s because the shark&#39;s tooth slipped and this&#10;piece of bark isn&#39;t big enough. That&#39;s the spear I want you to&#10;fetch; so I&#39;ll draw a picture of me myself &#39;splaining to you. My&#10;hair doesn&#39;t stand up like I&#39;ve drawn, but it&#39;s easier to draw that&#10;way. Now I&#39;ll draw you. I think you&#39;re very nice really, but I&#10;can&#39;t make you pretty in the picture, so you mustn&#39;t be &#39;fended.&#10;Are you &#39;fended?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Stranger-man (and he was a Tewara) smiled. He thought,&#10;&#39;There must be a big battle going to be fought somewhere, and this&#10;extraordinary child, who takes my magic shark&#39;s tooth but who does&#10;not swell up or burst, is telling me to call all the great Chief&#39;s&#10;tribe to help him. He is a great Chief, or he would have noticed&#10;me.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Look,&#39; said Taffy, drawing very hard and rather scratchily,&#10;&#39;now I&#39;ve drawn you, and I&#39;ve put the spear that Daddy wants into&#10;your hand, just to remind you that you&#39;re to bring it. Now I&#39;ll&#10;show you how to find my Mummy&#39;s living-address. You go along till&#10;you come to two trees (those are trees), and then you go over a&#10;hill (that&#39;s a hill), and then you come into a beaver-swamp all&#10;full of beavers. I haven&#39;t put in all the beavers, because I can&#39;t&#10;draw beavers, but I&#39;ve drawn their heads, and that&#39;s all you&#39;ll see&#10;of them when you cross the swamp. Mind you don&#39;t fall in! Then our&#10;Cave is just beyond the beaver-swamp. It isn&#39;t as high as the hills&#10;really, but I can&#39;t draw things very small. That&#39;s my Mummy&#10;outside. She is beautiful. She is the most beautifullest Mummy&#10;there ever was, but she won&#39;t be &#39;fended when she sees I&#39;ve drawn&#10;her so plain. She&#39;ll be pleased of me because I can draw. Now, in&#10;case you forget, I&#39;ve drawn the spear that Daddy wants outside our&#10;Cave. It&#39;s inside really, but you show the picture to my Mummy and&#10;she&#39;ll give it you. I&#39;ve made her holding up her hands, because I&#10;know she&#39;ll be so pleased to see you. Isn&#39;t it a beautiful picture?&#10;And do you quite understand, or shall I &#39;splain again?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Stranger-man (and he was a Tewara) looked at the picture and&#10;nodded very hard. He said to himself,&#39; If I do not fetch this great&#10;Chief&#39;s tribe to help him, he will be slain by his enemies who are&#10;coming up on all sides with spears. Now I see why the great Chief&#10;pretended not to notice me! He feared that his enemies were hiding&#10;in the bushes and would see him. Therefore he turned to me his&#10;back, and let the wise and wonderful child draw the terrible&#10;picture showing me his difficulties. I will away and get help for&#10;him from his tribe.&#39; He did not even ask Taffy the road, but raced&#10;off into the bushes like the wind, with the birch-bark in his hand,&#10;and Taffy sat down most pleased.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now this is the picture that Taffy had drawn for him!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;What have you been doing, Taffy?&#39; said Tegumai. He had mended&#10;his spear and was carefully waving it to and fro.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;It&#39;s a little berangement of my own, Daddy dear,&#39; said Taffy.&#10;&#39;If you won&#39;t ask me questions, you&#39;ll know all about it in a&#10;little time, and you&#39;ll be surprised. You don&#39;t know how surprised&#10;you&#39;ll be, Daddy! Promise you&#39;ll be surprised.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Very well,&#39; said Tegumai, and went on fishing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Stranger-man&#8212;did you know he was a Tewara?&#8212;hurried away with&#10;the picture and ran for some miles, till quite by accident he found&#10;Teshumai Tewindrow at the door of her Cave, talking to some other&#10;Neolithic ladies who had come in to a Primitive lunch. Taffy was&#10;very like Teshumai, especially about the upper part of the face and&#10;the eyes, so the Stranger-man&#8212;always a pure Tewara&#8212;smiled politely&#10;and handed Teshumai the birch-bark. He had run hard, so that he&#10;panted, and his legs were scratched with brambles, but he still&#10;tried to be polite.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As soon as Teshumai saw the picture she screamed like anything&#10;and flew at the Stranger-man. The other Neolithic ladies at once&#10;knocked him down and sat on him in a long line of six, while&#10;Teshumai pulled his hair.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;It&#39;s as plain as the nose on this Stranger-man&#39;s face,&#39; she&#10;said. &#39;He has stuck my Tegumai all full of spears, and frightened&#10;poor Taffy so that her hair stands all on end; and not content with&#10;that, he brings me a horrid picture of how it was done. Look!&#39; She&#10;showed the picture to all the Neolithic ladies sitting patiently on&#10;the Stranger-man. &#39;Here is my Tegumai with his arm broken; here is&#10;a spear sticking into his back; here is a man with a spear ready to&#10;throw; here is another man throwing a spear from a Cave, and here&#10;are a whole pack of people&#39; (they were Taffy&#39;s beavers really, but&#10;they did look rather like people) &#39;coming up behind Tegumai. Isn&#39;t&#10;it shocking!&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Most shocking!&#39; said the Neolithic ladies, and they filled the&#10;Stranger-man&#39;s hair with mud (at which he was surprised), and they&#10;beat upon the Reverberating Tribal Drums, and called together all&#10;the chiefs of the Tribe of Tegumai, with their Hetmans and Dolmans,&#10;all Neguses, Woons, and Akhoonds of the organisation, in addition&#10;to the Warlocks, Angekoks, Juju-men, Bonzes, and the rest, who&#10;decided that before they chopped the Stranger-man&#39;s head off he&#10;should instantly lead them down to the river and show them where he&#10;had hidden poor Taffy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;By this time the Stranger-man (in spite of being a Tewara) was&#10;really annoyed. They had filled his hair quite solid with mud; they&#10;had rolled him up and down on knobby pebbles; they had sat upon him&#10;in a long line of six; they had thumped him and bumped him till he&#10;could hardly breathe; and though he did not understand their&#10;language, he was almost sure that the names the Neolithic ladies&#10;called him were not ladylike. However, he said nothing till all the&#10;Tribe of Tegumai were assembled, and then he led them back to the&#10;bank of the Wagai river, and there they found Taffy making&#10;daisy-chains, and Tegumai carefully spearing small carp with his&#10;mended spear.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Well, you have been quick!&#39; said Taffy. &#39;But why did you bring&#10;so many people? Daddy dear, this is my surprise. Are you surprised,&#10;Daddy?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Very,&#39; said Tegumai; &#39;but it has ruined all my fishing for the&#10;day. Why, the whole dear, kind, nice, clean, quiet Tribe is here,&#10;Taffy.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And so they were. First of all walked Teshumai Tewindrow and the&#10;Neolithic ladies, tightly holding on to the Stranger-man, whose&#10;hair was full of mud (although he was a Tewara). Behind them came&#10;the Head Chief, the Vice-Chief, the Deputy and Assistant Chiefs&#10;(all armed to the upper teeth), the Hetmans and Heads of Hundreds,&#10;Platoffs with their Platoons, and Dolmans with their Detachments;&#10;Woons, Neguses, and Akhoonds ranking in the rear (still armed to&#10;the teeth). Behind them was the Tribe in hierarchical order, from&#10;owners of four caves (one for each season), a private reindeer-run,&#10;and two salmon-leaps, to feudal and prognathous Villeins,&#10;semi-entitled to half a bearskin of winter nights, seven yards from&#10;the fire, and adscript serfs, holding the reversion of a scraped&#10;marrow-bone under heriot (Aren&#39;t those beautiful words, Best&#10;Beloved?). They were all there, prancing and shouting, and they&#10;frightened every fish for twenty miles, and Tegumai thanked them in&#10;a fluid Neolithic oration.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then Teshumai Tewindrow ran down and kissed and hugged Taffy&#10;very much indeed; but the Head Chief of the Tribe of Tegumai took&#10;Tegumai by the top-knot feathers and shook him severely.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Explain! Explain! Explain!&#39; cried all the Tribe of Tegumai.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Goodness&#39; sakes alive!&#39; said Tegumai. &#39;Let go of my top-knot.&#10;Can&#39;t a man break his carp-spear without the whole countryside&#10;descending on him? You&#39;re a very interfering people.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;I don&#39;t believe you&#39;ve brought my Daddy&#39;s black-handled spear&#10;after all,&#39; said Taffy. &#39;And what are you doing to my nice&#10;Stranger-man?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;They were thumping him by twos and threes and tens till his eyes&#10;turned round and round. He could only gasp and point at Taffy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Where are the bad people who speared you, my darling?&#39; said&#10;Teshumai Tewindrow.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;There weren&#39;t any,&#39; said Tegumai. &#39;My only visitor this morning&#10;was the poor fellow that you are trying to choke. Aren&#39;t you well,&#10;or are you ill, O Tribe of Tegumai?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;He came with a horrible picture,&#39; said the Head Chief,&#8212;&#39;a&#10;picture that showed you were full of spears.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Er-um-Pr&#39;aps I&#39;d better &#39;splain that I gave him that picture,&#39;&#10;said Taffy, but she did not feel quite comfy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;You!&#39; said the Tribe of Tegumai all together.&#10;&#39;Small-person-with-no-manners-who-ought-to-be-spanked! You?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Taffy dear, I&#39;m afraid we&#39;re in for a little trouble,&#39; said her&#10;Daddy, and put his arm round her, so she didn&#39;t care.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Explain! Explain! Explain!&#39; said the Head Chief of the Tribe of&#10;Tegumai, and he hopped on one foot.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;I wanted the Stranger-man to fetch Daddy&#39;s spear, so I drawded&#10;it,&#39; said Taffy. &#39;There wasn&#39;t lots of spears. There was only one&#10;spear. I drawded it three times to make sure. I couldn&#39;t help it&#10;looking as if it stuck into Daddy&#39;s head&#8212;there wasn&#39;t room on the&#10;birch-bark; and those things that Mummy called bad people are my&#10;beavers. I drawded them to show him the way through the swamp; and&#10;I drawded Mummy at the mouth of the Cave looking pleased because he&#10;is a nice Stranger-man, and I think you are just the stupidest&#10;people in the world,&#39; said Taffy. &#39;He is a very nice man. Why have&#10;you filled his hair with mud? Wash him!&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Nobody said anything at all for a longtime, till the Head Chief&#10;laughed; then the Stranger-man (who was at least a Tewara) laughed;&#10;then Tegumai laughed till he fell down flat on the bank; then all&#10;the Tribe laughed more and worse and louder. The only people who&#10;did not laugh were Teshumai Tewindrow and all the Neolithic ladies.&#10;They were very polite to all their husbands, and said &#39;Idiot!&#39; ever&#10;so often.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then the Head Chief of the Tribe of Tegumai cried and said and&#10;sang, &#39;O Small-person-with-out-any-manners-who-ought-to-be-spanked,&#10;you&#39;ve hit upon a great invention!&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;I didn&#39;t intend to; I only wanted Daddy&#39;s black-handled spear,&#39;&#10;said Taffy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Never mind. It is a great invention, and some day men will call&#10;it writing. At present it is only pictures, and, as we have seen&#10;to-day, pictures are not always properly understood. But a time&#10;will come, O Babe of Tegumai, when we shall make letters&#8212;all&#10;twenty-six of &#39;em,&#8212;and when we shall be able to read as well as to&#10;write, and then we shall always say exactly what we mean without&#10;any mistakes. Let the Neolithic ladies wash the mud out of the&#10;stranger&#39;s hair.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;I shall be glad of that,&#39; said Taffy, &#39;because, after all,&#10;though you&#39;ve brought every single other spear in the Tribe of&#10;Tegumai, you&#39;ve forgotten my Daddy&#39;s black-handled spear.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then the Head Chief cried and said and sang, &#39;Taffy dear, the&#10;next time you write a picture-letter, you&#39;d better send a man who&#10;can talk our language with it, to explain what it means. I don&#39;t&#10;mind it myself, because I am a Head Chief, but it&#39;s very bad for&#10;the rest of the Tribe of Tegumai, and, as you can see, it surprises&#10;the stranger.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then they adopted the Stranger-man (a genuine Tewara of Tewar)&#10;into the Tribe of Tegumai, because he was a gentleman and did not&#10;make a fuss about the mud that the Neolithic ladies had put into&#10;his hair. But from that day to this (and I suppose it is all&#10;Taffy&#39;s fault), very few little girls have ever liked learning to&#10;read or write. Most of them prefer to draw pictures and play about&#10;with their Daddies&#8212;just like Taffy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;THERE runs a road by Merrow Down&#8212;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;A grassy track to-day it is&#60;br /&#62;&#10;An hour out of Guildford town,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;Above the river Wey it is.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Here, when they heard the horse-bells ring,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;The ancient Britons dressed and rode&#60;br /&#62;&#10;To watch the dark Phoenicians bring&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;Their goods along the Western Road.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And here, or hereabouts, they met&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;To hold their racial talks and such&#8212;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;To barter beads for Whitby jet,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;And tin for gay shell torques and such.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But long and long before that time&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;(When bison used to roam on it)&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Did Taffy and her Daddy climb&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;That down, and had their home on it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then beavers built in Broadstone brook&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;And made a swamp where Bramley stands:&#60;br /&#62;&#10;And hears from Shere would come and look&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;For Taffimai where Shamley stands.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Wey, that Taffy called Wagai,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;Was more than six times bigger then;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;And all the Tribe of Tegumai&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;They cut a noble figure then!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 10, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/865', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;How the Alphabet was Made'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;THE week after Taffimai Metallumai (we will still call her&#10;Taffy, Best Beloved) made that little mistake about her Daddy&#39;s&#10;spear and the Stranger-man and the picture-letter and all, she went&#10;carp-fishing again with her Daddy. Her Mummy wanted her to stay at&#10;home and help hang up hides to dry on the big drying-poles outside&#10;their Neolithic Cave, but Taffy slipped away down to her Daddy&#10;quite early, and they fished. Presently she began to giggle, and&#10;her Daddy said, &#39;Don&#39;t be silly, child.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;But wasn&#39;t it inciting!&#39; said Taffy. &#39;Don&#39;t you remember how&#10;the Head Chief puffed out his cheeks, and how funny the nice&#10;Stranger-man looked with the mud in his hair?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Well do I,&#39; said Tegumai. &#39;I had to pay two deerskins&#8212;soft ones&#10;with fringes&#8212;to the Stranger-man for the things we did to him.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;We didn&#39;t do anything,&#39; said Taffy. &#39;It was Mummy and the other&#10;Neolithic ladies&#8212;and the mud.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;We won&#39;t talk about that,&#39; said her Daddy, &#39;Let&#39;s have&#10;lunch.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Taffy took a marrow-bone and sat mousy-quiet for ten whole&#10;minutes, while her Daddy scratched on pieces of birch-bark with a&#10;shark&#39;s tooth. Then she said, &#39;Daddy, I&#39;ve thinked of a secret&#10;surprise. You make a noise&#8212;any sort of noise.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Ah!&#39; said Tegumai. &#39;Will that do to begin with?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Yes,&#39; said Taffy. &#39;You look just like a carp-fish with its&#10;mouth open. Say it again, please.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Ah! ah! ah!&#39; said her Daddy. &#39;Don&#39;t be rude, my daughter.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;I&#39;m not meaning rude, really and truly,&#39; said Taffy. &#39;It&#39;s part&#10;of my secret-surprise-think. Do say ah, Daddy, and keep your mouth&#10;open at the end, and lend me that tooth. I&#39;m going to draw a&#10;carp-fish&#39;s mouth wide-open.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;What for?&#39; said her Daddy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Don&#39;t you see?&#39; said Taffy, scratching away on the bark. &#39;That&#10;will be our little secret s&#39;prise. When I draw a carp-fish with his&#10;mouth open in the smoke at the back of our Cave&#8212;if Mummy doesn&#39;t&#10;mind&#8212;it will remind you of that ah-noise. Then we can play that it&#10;was me jumped out of the dark and s&#39;prised you with that noise&#8212;same&#10;as I did in the beaver-swamp last winter.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Really?&#39; said her Daddy, in the voice that grown-ups use when&#10;they are truly attending. &#39;Go on, Taffy.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Oh bother!&#39; she said. &#39;I can&#39;t draw all of a carp-fish, but I&#10;can draw something that means a carp-fish&#39;s mouth. Don&#39;t you know&#10;how they stand on their heads rooting in the mud? Well, here&#39;s a&#10;pretence carp-fish (we can play that the rest of him is drawn).&#10;Here&#39;s just his mouth, and that means ah.&#39; And she drew this.&#10;(1.)&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;That&#39;s not bad,&#39; said Tegumai, and scratched on his own piece&#10;of bark for himself; but you&#39;ve forgotten the feeler that hangs&#10;across his mouth.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;But I can&#39;t draw, Daddy.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;You needn&#39;t draw anything of him except just the opening of his&#10;mouth and the feeler across. Then we&#39;ll know he&#39;s a carp-fish,&#10;&#39;cause the perches and trouts haven&#39;t got feelers. Look here,&#10;Taffy.&#39; And he drew this. (2.)&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Now I&#39;ll copy it.&#39; said Taffy. &#39;Will you understand this when&#10;you see it?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Perfectly,&#39; said her Daddy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And she drew this. (3.) &#39;And I&#39;ll be quite as s&#39;prised when I&#10;see it anywhere, as if you had jumped out from behind a tree and&#10;said &#39;&#34;Ah!&#34;&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Now, make another noise,&#39; said Taffy, very proud.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Yah!&#39; said her Daddy, very loud.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;H&#39;m,&#39; said Taffy. &#39;That&#39;s a mixy noise. The end part is&#10;ah-carp-fish-mouth; but what can we do about the front part?&#10;Yer-yer-yer and ah! Ya!&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;It&#39;s very like the carp-fish-mouth noise. Let&#39;s draw another&#10;bit of the carp-fish and join &#39;em,&#39; said her Daddy. He was quite&#10;incited too.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;No. If they&#39;re joined, I&#39;ll forget. Draw it separate. Draw his&#10;tail. If he&#39;s standing on his head the tail will come first.&#10;&#39;Sides, I think I can draw tails easiest,&#39; said Taffy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;A good notion,&#39; said Tegumai. &#39;Here&#39;s a carp-fish tail for the&#10;yer-noise.&#39; And he drew this. (4.)&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;I&#39;ll try now,&#39; said Taffy. &#39;&#39;Member I can&#39;t draw like you,&#10;Daddy. Will it do if I just draw the split part of the tail, and&#10;the sticky-down line for where it joins?&#39; And she drew this.&#10;(5.)&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Her Daddy nodded, and his eyes were shiny bright with&#10;&#39;citement.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;That&#39;s beautiful,&#39; she said. &#39;Now make another noise,&#10;Daddy.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Oh!&#39; said her Daddy, very loud.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;That&#39;s quite easy,&#39; said Taffy. &#39;You make your mouth all around&#10;like an egg or a stone. So an egg or a stone will do for that.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;You can&#39;t always find eggs or stones. We&#39;ll have to scratch a&#10;round something like one.&#39; And he drew this. (6.)&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;My gracious!&#39; said Taffy, &#39;what a lot of noise-pictures we&#39;ve&#10;made,&#8212;carp-mouth, carp-tail, and egg! Now, make another noise,&#10;Daddy.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Ssh!&#39; said her Daddy, and frowned to himself, but Taffy was too&#10;incited to notice.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;That&#39;s quite easy,&#39; she said, scratching on the bark.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Eh, what?&#39; said her Daddy. &#39;I meant I was thinking, and didn&#39;t&#10;want to be disturbed.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;It&#39;s a noise just the same. It&#39;s the noise a snake makes,&#10;Daddy, when it is thinking and doesn&#39;t want to be disturbed. Let&#39;s&#10;make the ssh-noise a snake. Will this do?&#39; And she drew this.&#10;(7.)&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;There,&#39; she said. &#39;That&#39;s another s&#39;prise-secret. When you draw&#10;a hissy-snake by the door of your little back-cave where you mend&#10;the spears, I&#39;ll know you&#39;re thinking hard; and I&#39;ll come in most&#10;mousy-quiet. And if you draw it on a tree by the river when you are&#10;fishing, I&#39;ll know you want me to walk most most mousy-quiet, so as&#10;not to shake the banks.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Perfectly true,&#39; said Tegumai. And there&#39;s more in this game&#10;than you think. Taffy, dear, I&#39;ve a notion that your Daddy&#39;s&#10;daughter has hit upon the finest thing that there ever was since&#10;the Tribe of Tegumai took to using shark&#39;s teeth instead of flints&#10;for their spear-heads. I believe we&#39;ve found out the big secret of&#10;the world.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Why?&#39; said Taffy, and her eyes shone too with incitement.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;I&#39;ll show,&#39; said her Daddy. &#39;What&#39;s water in the Tegumai&#10;language?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Ya, of course, and it means river too&#8212;like Wagai-ya&#8212;the Wagai&#10;river.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;What is bad water that gives you fever if you drink it&#8212;black&#10;water&#8212;swamp-water?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Yo, of course.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Now look,&#39; said her Daddy. &#39;S&#39;pose you saw this scratched by&#10;the side of a pool in the beaver-swamp?&#39; And he drew this. (8.)&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Carp-tail and round egg. Two noises mixed! Yo, bad water,&#39; said&#10;Taffy. &#39;&#39;Course I wouldn&#39;t drink that water because I&#39;d know you&#10;said it was bad.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;But I needn&#39;t be near the water at all. I might be miles away,&#10;hunting, and still&#8212;&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;And still it would be just the same as if you stood there and&#10;said, &#34;G&#39;way, Taffy, or you&#39;ll get fever.&#34; All that in a&#10;carp-fish-tail and a round egg! O Daddy, we must tell Mummy,&#10;quick!&#39; and Taffy danced all round him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Not yet,&#39; said Tegumai; &#39;not till we&#39;ve gone a little further.&#10;Let&#39;s see. Yo is bad water, but So is food cooked on the fire,&#10;isn&#39;t it?&#39; And he drew this. (9.)&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Yes. Snake and egg,&#39; said Taffy &#39;So that means dinner&#39;s ready.&#10;If you saw that scratched on a tree you&#39;d know it was time to come&#10;to the Cave. So&#39;d I.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;My Winkie!&#39; said Tegumai. &#39;That&#39;s true too. But wait a minute.&#10;I see a difficulty. SO means &#34;come and have dinner,&#34; but sho means&#10;the drying-poles where we hang our hides.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Horrid old drying-poles!&#39; said Taffy. &#39;I hate helping to hang&#10;heavy, hot, hairy hides on them. If you drew the snake and egg, and&#10;I thought it meant dinner, and I came in from the wood and found&#10;that it meant I was to help Mummy hang the two hides on the&#10;drying-poles, what would I do?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;You&#39;d be cross. So&#39;d Mummy. We must make a new picture for sho.&#10;We must draw a spotty snake that hisses sh-sh, and we&#39;ll play that&#10;the plain snake only hisses ssss.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;I couldn&#39;t be sure how to put in the spots,&#39; said Taffy. &#39;And&#10;p&#39;raps if you were in a hurry you might leave them out, and I&#39;d&#10;think it was so when it was sho, and then Mummy would catch me just&#10;the same. No! I think we&#39;d better draw a picture of the horrid high&#10;drying-poles their very selves, and make quite sure. I&#39;ll put them&#10;in just after the hissy-snake. Look!&#39; And she drew this. (10.)&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;P&#39;raps that&#39;s safest. It&#39;s very like our drying-poles, anyhow,&#39;&#10;said her Daddy, laughing. &#39;Now I&#39;ll make a new noise with a snake&#10;and drying-pole sound in it. I&#39;ll say shi. That&#39;s Tegumai for&#10;spear, Taffy.&#39; And he laughed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Don&#39;t make fun of me,&#39; said Taffy, as she thought of her&#10;picture-letter and the mud in the Stranger-man&#39;s hair. &#39;You draw&#10;it, Daddy.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;We won&#39;t have beavers or hills this time, eh?&#39; said her Daddy,&#10;&#39;I&#39;ll just draw a straight line for my spear.&#39; and he drew this.&#10;(11.)&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Even Mummy couldn&#39;t mistake that for me being killed.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Please don&#39;t, Daddy. It makes me uncomfy. Do some more noises.&#10;We&#39;re getting on beautifully.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Er-hm!&#39; said Tegumai, looking up. &#39;We&#39;ll say shu. That means&#10;sky.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Taffy drew the snake and the drying-pole. Then she stopped. &#39;We&#10;must make a new picture for that end sound, mustn&#39;t we?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Shu-shu-u-u-u!&#39; said her Daddy. &#39;Why, it&#39;s just like the&#10;round-egg-sound made thin.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Then s&#39;pose we draw a thin round egg, and pretend it&#39;s a frog&#10;that hasn&#39;t eaten anything for years.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;N-no,&#39; said her Daddy. &#39;If we drew that in a hurry we might&#10;mistake it for the round egg itself. Shu-shu-shu! &#39;I tell you what&#10;we&#39;ll do. We&#39;ll open a little hole at the end of the round egg to&#10;show how the O-noise runs out all thin, ooo-oo-oo. Like this.&#39; And&#10;he drew this. (12.)&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Oh, that&#39;s lovely! Much better than a thin frog. Go on,&#39; said&#10;Taffy, using her shark&#39;s tooth. Her Daddy went on drawing, and his&#10;hand shook with incitement. He went on till he had drawn this.&#10;(13.)&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Don&#39;t look up, Taffy,&#39; he said. &#39;Try if you can make out what&#10;that means in the Tegumai language. If you can, we&#39;ve found the&#10;Secret.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Snake&#8212;pole&#8212;broken&#8212;egg&#8212;carp&#8212;tail and carp-mouth,&#39; said Taffy.&#10;&#39;Shu-ya. Sky-water (rain).&#39; Just then a drop fell on her hand, for&#10;the day had clouded over. &#39;Why, Daddy, it&#39;s raining. Was that what&#10;you meant to tell me?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Of course,&#39; said her Daddy. &#39;And I told it you without saying a&#10;word, didn&#39;t I?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Well, I think I would have known it in a minute, but that&#10;raindrop made me quite sure. I&#39;ll always remember now. Shu-ya means&#10;rain, or &#34;it is going to rain.&#34; Why, Daddy!&#39; She got up and danced&#10;round him. &#39;S&#39;pose you went out before I was awake, and drawed&#10;shu-ya in the smoke on the wall, I&#39;d know it was going to rain and&#10;I&#39;d take my beaver-skin hood. Wouldn&#39;t Mummy be surprised?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tegumai got up and danced. (Daddies didn&#39;t mind doing those&#10;things in those days.) &#39;More than that! More than that!&#39; he said.&#10;&#39;S&#39;pose I wanted to tell you it wasn&#39;t going to rain much and you&#10;must come down to the river, what would we draw? Say the words in&#10;Tegumai-talk first.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Shu-ya-las, ya maru. (Sky-water ending. River come to.) what a&#10;lot of new sounds! I don&#39;t see how we can draw them.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;But I do&#8212;but I do!&#39; said Tegumai. &#39;Just attend a minute, Taffy,&#10;and we won&#39;t do any more to-day. We&#39;ve got shu-ya all right,&#10;haven&#39;t we? But this las is a teaser. La-la-la&#39; and he waved his&#10;shark-tooth.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;There&#39;s the hissy-snake at the end and the carp-mouth before&#10;the snake&#8212;as-as-as. We only want la-la,&#39; said Taffy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;I know it, but we have to make la-la. And we&#39;re the first&#10;people in all the world who&#39;ve ever tried to do it, Taffimai!&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Well,&#39; said Taffy, yawning, for she was rather tired. &#39;Las&#10;means breaking or finishing as well as ending, doesn&#39;t it?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;So it does,&#39; said Tegumai. &#39;To-las means that there&#39;s no water&#10;in the tank for Mummy to cook with&#8212;just when I&#39;m going hunting,&#10;too.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;And shi-las means that your spear is broken. If I&#39;d only&#10;thought of that instead of drawing silly beaver pictures for the&#10;Stranger!&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;La! La! La!&#39; said Tegumai, waiving his stick and frowning. &#39;Oh&#10;bother!&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;I could have drawn shi quite easily,&#39; Taffy went on. &#39;Then I&#39;d&#10;have drawn your spear all broken&#8212;this way!&#39; And she drew. (14.)&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;The very thing,&#39; said Tegumai. &#39;That&#39;s la all over. It isn&#39;t&#10;like any of the other marks either.&#39; And he drew this. (15.)&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Now for ya. Oh, we&#39;ve done that before. Now for maru.&#10;Mum-mum-mum. Mum shuts one&#39;s mouth up, doesn&#39;t it? We&#39;ll draw a&#10;shut mouth like this.&#39; And he drew. (16.)&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Then the carp-mouth open. That makes Ma-ma-ma! But what about&#10;this rrrrr-thing, Taffy?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;It sounds all rough and edgy, like your shark-tooth saw when&#10;you&#39;re cutting out a plank for the canoe,&#39; said Taffy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;You mean all sharp at the edges, like this?&#39; said Tegumai. And&#10;he drew. (17.)&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;&#39;Xactly,&#39; said Taffy. &#39;But we don&#39;t want all those teeth: only&#10;put two.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;I&#39;ll only put in one,&#39; said Tegumai. &#39;If this game of ours is&#10;going to be what I think it will, the easier we make our&#10;sound-pictures the better for everybody.&#39; And he drew. (18.)&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Now, we&#39;ve got it,&#39; said Tegumai, standing on one leg. &#39;I&#39;ll&#10;draw &#39;em all in a string like fish.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Hadn&#39;t we better put a little bit of stick or something between&#10;each word, so&#39;s they won&#39;t rub up against each other and jostle,&#10;same as if they were carps?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Oh, I&#39;ll leave a space for that,&#39; said her Daddy. And very&#10;incitedly he drew them all without stopping, on a big new bit of&#10;birch-bark. (19.)&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Shu-ya-las ya-maru,&#39; said Taffy, reading it out sound by&#10;sound.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;That&#39;s enough for to-day,&#39; said Tegumai. &#39;Besides, you&#39;re&#10;getting tired, Taffy. Never mind, dear. We&#39;ll finish it all&#10;to-morrow, and then we&#39;ll be remembered for years and years after&#10;the biggest trees you can see are all chopped up for firewood.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So they went home, and all that evening Tegumai sat on one side&#10;of the fire and Taffy on the other, drawing ya&#39;s and yo&#39;s and shu&#39;s&#10;and shi&#39;s in the smoke on the wall and giggling together till her&#10;Mummy said, &#39;Really, Tegumai, you&#39;re worse than my Taffy.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Please don&#39;t mind,&#39; said Taffy. &#39;It&#39;s only our secret-s&#39;prise,&#10;Mummy dear, and we&#39;ll tell you all about it the very minute it&#39;s&#10;done; but please don&#39;t ask me what it is now, or else I&#39;ll have to&#10;tell.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So her Mummy most carefully didn&#39;t; and bright and early next&#10;morning Tegumai went down to the river to think about new sound&#10;pictures, and when Taffy got up she saw Ya-las (water is ending or&#10;running out) chalked on the side of the big stone water-tank,&#10;outside the Cave.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Um,&#39; said Taffy. &#39;These picture-sounds are rather a bother!&#10;Daddy&#39;s just as good as come here himself and told me to get more&#10;water for Mummy to cook with.&#39; She went to the spring at the back&#10;of the house and filled the tank from a bark bucket, and then she&#10;ran down to the river and pulled her Daddy&#39;s left ear&#8212;the one that&#10;belonged to her to pull when she was good.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Now come along and we&#39;ll draw all the left-over&#10;sound-pictures,&#39; said her Daddy, and they had a most inciting day&#10;of it, and a beautiful lunch in the middle, and two games of romps.&#10;When they came to T, Taffy said that as her name, and her Daddy&#39;s,&#10;and her Mummy&#39;s all began with that sound, they should draw a sort&#10;of family group of themselves holding hands. That was all very well&#10;to draw once or twice; but when it came to drawing it six or seven&#10;times, Taffy and Tegumai drew it scratchier and scratchier, till at&#10;last the T-sound was only a thin long Tegumai with his arms out to&#10;hold Taffy and Teshumai. You can see from these three pictures&#10;partly how it happened. (20, 21, 22.)&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Many of the other pictures were much too beautiful to begin&#10;with, especially before lunch, but as they were drawn over and over&#10;again on birch-bark, they became plainer and easier, till at last&#10;even Tegumai said he could find no fault with them. They turned the&#10;hissy-snake the other way round for the Z-sound, to show it was&#10;hissing backwards in a soft and gentle way (23); and they just made&#10;a twiddle for E, because it came into the pictures so often (24);&#10;and they drew pictures of the sacred Beaver of the Tegumais for the&#10;B-sound (25, 26, 27, 28); and because it was a nasty, nosy noise,&#10;they just drew noses for the N-sound, till they were tired (29);&#10;and they drew a picture of the big lake-pike&#39;s mouth for the greedy&#10;Ga-sound (30); and they drew the pike&#39;s mouth again with a spear&#10;behind it for the scratchy, hurty Ka-sound (31); and they drew&#10;pictures of a little bit of the winding Wagai river for the nice&#10;windy-windy Wa-sound (32, 33); and so on and so forth and so&#10;following till they had done and drawn all the sound-pictures that&#10;they wanted, and there was the Alphabet, all complete.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And after thousands and thousands and thousands of years, and&#10;after Hieroglyphics and Demotics, and Nilotics, and Cryptics, and&#10;Cufics, and Runics, and Dorics, and Ionics, and all sorts of other&#10;ricks and tricks (because the Woons, and the Neguses, and the&#10;Akhoonds, and the Repositories of Tradition would never leave a&#10;good thing alone when they saw it), the fine old easy,&#10;understandable Alphabet&#8212;A, B, C, D, E, and the rest of &#39;em&#8212;got back&#10;into its proper shape again for all Best Beloveds to learn when&#10;they are old enough.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But I remember Tegumai Bopsulai, and Taffimai Metallumai and&#10;Teshumai Tewindrow, her dear Mummy, and all the days gone by. And&#10;it was so&#8212;just so&#8212;a little time ago&#8212;on the banks of the big&#10;Wagai!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;OF all the Tribe of Tegumai&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;Who cut that figure, none remain,&#8212;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;On Merrow Down the cuckoos cry&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;The silence and the sun remain.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But as the faithful years return&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;And hearts unwounded sing again,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Comes Taffy dancing through the fern&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;To lead the Surrey spring again.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Her brows are bound with bracken-fronds,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;And golden elf-locks fly above;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Her eyes are bright as diamonds&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;And bluer than the skies above.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In mocassins and deer-skin cloak,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;Unfearing, free and fair she flits,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;And lights her little damp-wood smoke&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;To show her Daddy where she flits.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For far&#8212;oh, very far behind,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;So far she cannot call to him,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Comes Tegumai alone to find&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;The daughter that was all to him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 10, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/865', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Crab that Played with the Sea'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;BEFORE the High and Far-Off Times, O my Best Beloved, came the&#10;Time of the Very Beginnings; and that was in the days when the&#10;Eldest Magician was getting Things ready. First he got the Earth&#10;ready; then he got the Sea ready; and then he told all the Animals&#10;that they could come out and play. And the Animals said, &#39;O Eldest&#10;Magician, what shall we play at?&#39; and he said, &#39;I will show you. He&#10;took the Elephant&#8212;All-the-Elephant-there-was&#8212;and said, &#39;Play at&#10;being an Elephant,&#39; and All-the-Elephant-there-was played. He took&#10;the Beaver&#8212;All-the-Beaver-there-was and said, &#39;Play at being a&#10;Beaver,&#39; and All-the Beaver-there-was played. He took the&#10;Cow&#8212;All-the Cow-there-was&#8212;and said, &#39;Play at being a Cow,&#39; and&#10;All-the-Cow-there-was played. He took the Turtle&#8212;All-the-Turtle&#10;there-was and said, &#39;Play at being a Turtle,&#39; and&#10;All-the-Turtle-there-was played. One by one he took all the beasts&#10;and birds and fishes and told them what to play at.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But towards evening, when people and things grow restless and&#10;tired, there came up the Man (With his own little&#10;girl-daughter?)&#8212;Yes, with his own best beloved little girl-daughter&#10;sitting upon his shoulder, and he said, &#39;What is this play, Eldest&#10;Magician?&#39; And the Eldest Magician said, &#39;Ho, Son of Adam, this is&#10;the play of the Very Beginning; but you are too wise for this&#10;play.&#39; And the Man saluted and said, &#39;Yes, I am too wise for this&#10;play; but see that you make all the Animals obedient to me.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now, while the two were talking together, Pau Amma the Crab, who&#10;was next in the game, scuttled off sideways and stepped into the&#10;sea, saying to himself, &#39;I will play my play alone in the deep&#10;waters, and I will never be obedient to this son of Adam.&#39; Nobody&#10;saw him go away except the little girl-daughter where she leaned on&#10;the Man&#39;s shoulder. And the play went on till there were no more&#10;Animals left without orders; and the Eldest Magician wiped the fine&#10;dust off his hands and walked about the world to see how the&#10;Animals were playing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He went North, Best Beloved, and he found&#10;All-the-Elephant-there-was digging with his tusks and stamping with&#10;his feet in the nice new clean earth that had been made ready for&#10;him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Kun?&#39; said All-the-Elephant-there-was, meaning, &#39;Is this&#10;right?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Payah kun,&#39; said the Eldest Magician, meaning, &#39;That is quite&#10;right&#39;; and he breathed upon the great rocks and lumps of earth&#10;that All-the-Elephant-there-was had thrown up, and they became the&#10;great Himalayan Mountains, and you can look them out on the&#10;map.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He went East, and he found All-the-Cow there-was feeding in the&#10;field that had been made ready for her, and she licked her tongue&#10;round a whole forest at a time, and swallowed it and sat down to&#10;chew her cud.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Kun?&#39; said All-the-Cow-there-was.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Payah kun,&#39; said the Eldest Magician; and he breathed upon the&#10;bare patch where she had eaten, and upon the place where she had&#10;sat down, and one became the great Indian Desert, and the other&#10;became the Desert of Sahara, and you can look them out on the&#10;map.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He went West, and he found All-the-Beaver-there-was making a&#10;beaver-dam across the mouths of broad rivers that had been got&#10;ready for him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Kun?&#39; said All-the-Beaver-there-was.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Payah kun,&#39; said the Eldest Magician; and he breathed upon the&#10;fallen trees and the still water, and they became the Everglades in&#10;Florida, and you may look them out on the map.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then he went South and found All-the-Turtle-there-was scratching&#10;with his flippers in the sand that had been got ready for him, and&#10;the sand and the rocks whirled through the air and fell far off&#10;into the sea.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Kun?&#39; said All-the-Turtle-there-was.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Payah kun,&#39; said the Eldest Magician; and he breathed upon the&#10;sand and the rocks, where they had fallen in the sea, and they&#10;became the most beautiful islands of Borneo, Celebes, Sumatra,&#10;Java, and the rest of the Malay Archipelago, and you can look them&#10;out on the map!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;By and by the Eldest Magician met the Man on the banks of the&#10;Perak river, and said, &#39;Ho! Son of Adam, are all the Animals&#10;obedient to you?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Yes,&#39; said the Man.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Is all the Earth obedient to you?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Yes,&#39; said the Man.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Is all the Sea obedient to you?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;No,&#39; said the Man. &#39;Once a day and once a night the Sea runs up&#10;the Perak river and drives the sweet-water back into the forest, so&#10;that my house is made wet; once a day and once a night it runs down&#10;the river and draws all the water after it, so that there is&#10;nothing left but mud, and my canoe is upset. Is that the play you&#10;told it to play?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;No,&#39; said the Eldest Magician. &#39;That is a new and a bad&#10;play.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Look!&#39; said the Man, and as he spoke the great Sea came up the&#10;mouth of the Perak river, driving the river backwards till it&#10;overflowed all the dark forests for miles and miles, and flooded&#10;the Man&#39;s house.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;This is wrong. Launch your canoe and we will find out who is&#10;playing with the Sea,&#39; said the Eldest Magician. They stepped into&#10;the canoe; the little girl-daughter came with them; and the Man&#10;took his kris&#8212;a curving, wavy dagger with a blade like a flame,&#8212;and&#10;they pushed out on the Perak river. Then the sea began to run back&#10;and back, and the canoe was sucked out of the mouth of the Perak&#10;river, past Selangor, past Malacca, past Singapore, out and out to&#10;the Island of Bingtang, as though it had been pulled by a&#10;string.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then the Eldest Magician stood up and shouted, &#39;Ho! beasts,&#10;birds, and fishes, that I took between my hands at the Very&#10;Beginning and taught the play that you should play, which one of&#10;you is playing with the Sea?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then all the beasts, birds, and fishes said together, &#39;Eldest&#10;Magician, we play the plays that you taught us to play&#8212;we and our&#10;children&#39;s children. But not one of us plays with the Sea.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then the Moon rose big and full over the water, and the Eldest&#10;Magician said to the hunchbacked old man who sits in the Moon&#10;spinning a fishing-line with which he hopes one day to catch the&#10;world, &#39;Ho! Fisher of the Moon, are you playing with the Sea?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;No,&#39; said the Fisherman, &#39;I am spinning a line with which I&#10;shall some day catch the world; but I do not play with the Sea.&#39;&#10;And he went on spinning his line.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now there is also a Rat up in the Moon who always bites the old&#10;Fisherman&#39;s line as fast as it is made, and the Eldest Magician&#10;said to him, &#39;Ho! Rat of the Moon, are you playing with the&#10;Sea?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And the Rat said, &#39;I am too busy biting through the line that&#10;this old Fisherman is spinning. I do not play with the Sea.&#39; And he&#10;went on biting the line.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then the little girl-daughter put up her little soft brown arms&#10;with the beautiful white shell bracelets and said, &#39;O Eldest&#10;Magician! when my father here talked to you at the Very Beginning,&#10;and I leaned upon his shoulder while the beasts were being taught&#10;their plays, one beast went away naughtily into the Sea before you&#10;had taught him his play.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And the Eldest Magician said, &#39;How wise are little children who&#10;see and are silent! What was the beast like?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And the little girl-daughter said, &#39;He was round and he was&#10;flat; and his eyes grew upon stalks; and he walked sideways like&#10;this; and he was covered with strong armour upon his back.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And the Eldest Magician said, &#39;How wise are little children who&#10;speak truth! Now I know where Pau Amma went. Give me the&#10;paddle!&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So he took the paddle; but there was no need to paddle, for the&#10;water flowed steadily past all the islands till they came to the&#10;place called Pusat Tasek&#8212;the Heart of the Sea&#8212;where the great&#10;hollow is that leads down to the heart of the world, and in that&#10;hollow grows the Wonderful Tree, Pauh Janggi, that bears the magic&#10;twin nuts. Then the Eldest Magician slid his arm up to the shoulder&#10;through the deep warm water, and under the roots of the Wonderful&#10;Tree he touched the broad back of Pau Amma the Crab. And Pau Amma&#10;settled down at the touch, and all the Sea rose up as water rises&#10;in a basin when you put your hand into it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Ah!&#39; said the Eldest Magician. &#39;Now I know who has been playing&#10;with the Sea;&#39; and he called out, &#39;What are you doing, Pau&#10;Amma?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And Pau Amma, deep down below, answered, &#39;Once a day and once a&#10;night I go out to look for my food. Once a day and once a night I&#10;return. Leave me alone.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then the Eldest Magician said, &#39;Listen, Pau Amma. When you go&#10;out from your cave the waters of the Sea pour down into Pusat&#10;Tasek, and all the beaches of all the islands are left bare, and&#10;the little fish die, and Raja Moyang Kaban, the King of the&#10;Elephants, his legs are made muddy. When you come back and sit in&#10;Pusat Tasek, the waters of the Sea rise, and half the little&#10;islands are drowned, and the Man&#39;s house is flooded, and Raja&#10;Abdullah, the King of the Crocodiles, his mouth is filled with the&#10;salt water.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then Pau Amma, deep down below, laughed and said, &#39;I did not&#10;know I was so important. Henceforward I will go out seven times a&#10;day, and the waters shall never be still.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And the Eldest Magician said, &#39;I cannot make you play the play&#10;you were meant to play, Pau Amma, because you escaped me at the&#10;Very Beginning; but if you are not afraid, come up and we will talk&#10;about it.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;I am not afraid,&#39; said Pau Amma, and he rose to the top of the&#10;sea in the moonlight. There was nobody in the world so big as Pau&#10;Amma&#8212;for he was the King Crab of all Crabs. Not a common Crab, but&#10;a King Crab. One side of his great shell touched the beach at&#10;Sarawak; the other touched the beach at Pahang; and he was taller&#10;than the smoke of three volcanoes! As he rose up through the&#10;branches of the Wonderful Tree he tore off one of the great twin&#10;fruits&#8212;the magic double kernelled nuts that make people young,&#8212;and&#10;the little girl-daughter saw it bobbing alongside the canoe, and&#10;pulled it in and began to pick out the soft eyes of it with her&#10;little golden scissors.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Now,&#39; said the Magician, &#39;make a Magic, Pau Amma, to show that&#10;you are really important.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Pau Amma rolled his eyes and waved his legs, but he could only&#10;stir up the Sea, because, though he was a King Crab, he was nothing&#10;more than a Crab, and the Eldest Magician laughed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;You are not so important after all, Pau Amma,&#39; he said. &#39;Now,&#10;let me try,&#39; and he made a Magic with his left hand&#8212;with just the&#10;little finger of his left hand&#8212;and&#8212;lo and behold, Best Beloved, Pau&#10;Amma&#39;s hard, blue-green-black shell fell off him as a husk falls&#10;off a cocoa-nut, and Pau Amma was left all soft&#8212;soft as the little&#10;crabs that you sometimes find on the beach, Best Beloved.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Indeed, you are very important,&#39; said the Eldest Magician.&#10;&#39;Shall I ask the Man here to cut you with kris? Shall I send for&#10;Raja Moyang Kaban, the King of the Elephants, to pierce you with&#10;his tusks, or shall I call Raja Abdullah, the King of the&#10;Crocodiles, to bite you?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And Pau Amma said, &#39;I am ashamed! Give me back my hard shell and&#10;let me go back to Pusat Tasek, and I will only stir out once a day&#10;and once a night to get my food.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And the Eldest Magician said, &#39;No, Pau Amma, I will not give you&#10;back your shell, for you will grow bigger and prouder and stronger,&#10;and perhaps you will forget your promise, and you will play with&#10;the Sea once more.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then Pau Amma said, &#39;What shall I do? I am so big that I can&#10;only hide in Pusat Tasek, and if I go anywhere else, all soft as I&#10;am now, the sharks and the dogfish will eat me. And if I go to&#10;Pusat Tasek, all soft as I am now, though I may be safe, I can&#10;never stir out to get my food, and so I shall die.&#39; Then he waved&#10;his legs and lamented.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Listen, Pau Amma,&#39; said the Eldest Magician. &#39;I cannot make you&#10;play the play you were meant to play, because you escaped me at the&#10;Very Beginning; but if you choose, I can make every stone and every&#10;hole and every bunch of weed in all the seas a safe Pusat Tasek for&#10;you and your children for always.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then Pau Amma said, &#39;That is good, but I do not choose yet.&#10;Look! there is that Man who talked to you at the Very Beginning. If&#10;he had not taken up your attention I should not have grown tired of&#10;waiting and run away, and all this would never have happened. What&#10;will he do for me?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And the Man said, &#39;If you choose, I will make a Magic, so that&#10;both the deep water and the dry ground will be a home for you and&#10;your children&#8212;so that you shall be able to hide both on the land&#10;and in the sea.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And Pau Amma said, &#39;I do not choose yet. Look! there is that&#10;girl who saw me running away at the Very Beginning. If she had&#10;spoken then, the Eldest Magician would have called me back, and all&#10;this would never have happened. What will she do for me?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And the little girl-daughter said, &#39;This is a good nut that I am&#10;eating. If you choose, I will make a Magic and I will give you this&#10;pair of scissors, very sharp and strong, so that you and your&#10;children can eat cocoa-nuts like this all day long when you come up&#10;from the Sea to the land; or you can dig a Pusat Tasek for yourself&#10;with the scissors that belong to you when there is no stone or hole&#10;near by; and when the earth is too hard, by the help of these same&#10;scissors you can run up a tree.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And Pau Amma said, &#39;I do not choose yet, for, all soft as I am,&#10;these gifts would not help me. Give me back my shell, O Eldest&#10;Magician, and then I will play your play.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And the Eldest Magician said, &#39;I will give it back, Pau Amma,&#10;for eleven months of the year; but on the twelfth month of every&#10;year it shall grow soft again, to remind you and all your children&#10;that I can make magics, and to keep you humble, Pau Amma; for I see&#10;that if you can run both under the water and on land, you will grow&#10;too bold; and if you can climb trees and crack nuts and dig holes&#10;with your scissors, you will grow too greedy, Pau Amma.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then Pau Amma thought a little and said, &#39;I have made my choice.&#10;I will take all the gifts.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then the Eldest Magician made a Magic with the right hand, with&#10;all five fingers of his right hand, and lo and behold, Best&#10;Beloved, Pau Amma grew smaller and smaller and smaller, till at&#10;last there was only a little green crab swimming in the water&#10;alongside the canoe, crying in a very small voice, &#39;Give me the&#10;scissors!&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And the girl-daughter picked him up on the palm of her little&#10;brown hand, and sat him in the bottom of the canoe and gave him her&#10;scissors, and he waved them in his little arms, and opened them and&#10;shut them and snapped them, and said, &#39;I can eat nuts. I can crack&#10;shells. I can dig holes. I can climb trees. I can breathe in the&#10;dry air, and I can find a safe Pusat Tasek under every stone. I did&#10;not know I was so important. Kun?&#39; (Is this right?)&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Payah-kun,&#39; said the Eldest Magician, and he laughed and gave&#10;him his blessing; and little Pau Amma scuttled over the side of the&#10;canoe into the water; and he was so tiny that he could have hidden&#10;under the shadow of a dry leaf on land or of a dead shell at the&#10;bottom of the sea.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Was that well done?&#39; said the Eldest Magician.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Yes,&#39; said the Man. &#39;But now we must go back to Perak, and that&#10;is a weary way to paddle. If we had waited till Pau Amma had gone&#10;out of Pusat Tasek and come home, the water would have carried us&#10;there by itself.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;You are lazy,&#39; said the Eldest Magician. &#39;So your children&#10;shall be lazy. They shall be the laziest people in the world. They&#10;shall be called the Malazy&#8212;the lazy people;&#39; and he held up his&#10;finger to the Moon and said, &#39;O Fisherman, here is the Man too lazy&#10;to row home. Pull his canoe home with your line, Fisherman.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;No,&#39; said the Man. &#39;If I am to be lazy all my days, let the Sea&#10;work for me twice a day for ever. That will save paddling.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And the Eldest Magician laughed and said, &#39;Payah kun&#39; (That is&#10;right).&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And the Rat of the Moon stopped biting the line; and the&#10;Fisherman let his line down till it touched the Sea, and he pulled&#10;the whole deep Sea along, past the Island of Bintang, past&#10;Singapore, past Malacca, past Selangor, till the canoe whirled into&#10;the mouth of the Perak River again. Kun?&#39; said the Fisherman of the&#10;Moon.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Payah kun,&#39; said the Eldest Magician. &#39;See now that you pull&#10;the Sea twice a day and twice a night for ever, so that the Malazy&#10;fishermen may be saved paddling. But be careful not to do it too&#10;hard, or I shall make a magic on you as I did to Pau Amma.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then they all went up the Perak River and went to bed, Best&#10;Beloved.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now listen and attend!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;From that day to this the Moon has always pulled the sea up and&#10;down and made what we call the tides. Sometimes the Fisher of the&#10;Sea pulls a little too hard, and then we get spring tides; and&#10;sometimes he pulls a little too softly, and then we get what are&#10;called neap-tides; but nearly always he is careful, because of the&#10;Eldest Magician.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And Pau Amma? You can see when you go to the beach, how all Pau&#10;Amma&#39;s babies make little Pusat Taseks for themselves under every&#10;stone and bunch of weed on the sands; you can see them waving their&#10;little scissors; and in some parts of the world they truly live on&#10;the dry land and run up the palm trees and eat cocoa-nuts, exactly&#10;as the girl-daughter promised. But once a year all Pau Ammas must&#10;shake off their hard armour and be soft-to remind them of what the&#10;Eldest Magician could do. And so it isn&#39;t fair to kill or hunt Pau&#10;Amma&#39;s babies just because old Pau Amma was stupidly rude a very&#10;long time ago.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Oh yes! And Pau Amma&#39;s babies hate being taken out of their&#10;little Pusat Taseks and brought home in pickle-bottles. That is why&#10;they nip you with their scissors, and it serves you right!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;CHINA-GOING P&#39;s and O&#39;s&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Pass Pau Amma&#39;s playground close,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;And his Pusat Tasek lies&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Near the track of most B.I.&#39;s.&#60;br /&#62;&#10;U.Y.K. and N.D.L.&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Know Pau Amma&#39;s home as well&#60;br /&#62;&#10;As the fisher of the Sea knows&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#39;Bens,&#39; M.M.&#39;s, and Rubattinos.&#60;br /&#62;&#10;But (and this is rather queer)&#60;br /&#62;&#10;A.T.L.&#39;s can not come here;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;O. and O. and D.O.A.&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Must go round another way.&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Orient, Anchor, Bibby, Hall,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Never go that way at all.&#60;br /&#62;&#10;U.C.S. would have a fit&#60;br /&#62;&#10;If it found itself on it.&#60;br /&#62;&#10;And if &#39;Beavers&#39; took their cargoes&#60;br /&#62;&#10;To Penang instead of Lagos,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Or a fat Shaw-Savill bore&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Passengers to Singapore,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Or a White Star were to try a&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Little trip to Sourabaya,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Or a B.S.A. went on&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Past Natal to Cheribon,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Then great Mr. Lloyds would come&#60;br /&#62;&#10;With a wire and drag them home!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;You&#39;ll know what my riddle means&#60;br /&#62;&#10;When you&#39;ve eaten mangosteens.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Or if you can&#39;t wait till then, ask them to let you have the&#10;outside page of the Times; turn over to page 2 where it is marked&#10;&#39;Shipping&#39; on the top left hand; then take the Atlas (and that is&#10;the finest picture-book in the world) and see how the names of the&#10;places that the steamers go to fit into the names of the places on&#10;the map.

Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Cat that Walked by Himself'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;HEAR and attend and listen; for this befell and behappened and&#10;became and was, O my Best Beloved, when the Tame animals were wild.&#10;The Dog was wild, and the Horse was wild, and the Cow was wild, and&#10;the Sheep was wild, and the Pig was wild&#8212;as wild as wild could&#10;be&#8212;and they walked in the Wet Wild Woods by their wild lones. But&#10;the wildest of all the wild animals was the Cat. He walked by&#10;himself, and all places were alike to him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Of course the Man was wild too. He was dreadfully wild. He&#10;didn&#39;t even begin to be tame till he met the Woman, and she told&#10;him that she did not like living in his wild ways. She picked out a&#10;nice dry Cave, instead of a heap of wet leaves, to lie down in; and&#10;she strewed clean sand on the floor; and she lit a nice fire of&#10;wood at the back of the Cave; and she hung a dried wild-horse skin,&#10;tail-down, across the opening of the Cave; and she said, &#39;Wipe you&#10;feet, dear, when you come in, and now we&#39;ll keep house.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;That night, Best Beloved, they ate wild sheep roasted on the hot&#10;stones, and flavoured with wild garlic and wild pepper; and wild&#10;duck stuffed with wild rice and wild fenugreek and wild coriander;&#10;and marrow-bones of wild oxen; and wild cherries, and wild&#10;grenadillas. Then the Man went to sleep in front of the fire ever&#10;so happy; but the Woman sat up, combing her hair. She took the bone&#10;of the shoulder of mutton&#8212;the big fat blade-bone&#8212;and she looked at&#10;the wonderful marks on it, and she threw more wood on the fire, and&#10;she made a Magic. She made the First Singing Magic in the&#10;world.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Out in the Wet Wild Woods all the wild animals gathered together&#10;where they could see the light of the fire a long way off, and they&#10;wondered what it meant.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then Wild Horse stamped with his wild foot and said, &#39;O my&#10;Friends and O my Enemies, why have the Man and the Woman made that&#10;great light in that great Cave, and what harm will it do us?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Wild Dog lifted up his wild nose and smelled the smell of roast&#10;mutton, and said, &#39;I will go up and see and look, and say; for I&#10;think it is good. Cat, come with me.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Nenni!&#39; said the Cat. &#39;I am the Cat who walks by himself, and&#10;all places are alike to me. I will not come.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Then we can never be friends again,&#39; said Wild Dog, and he&#10;trotted off to the Cave. But when he had gone a little way the Cat&#10;said to himself, &#39;All places are alike to me. Why should I not go&#10;too and see and look and come away at my own liking.&#39; So he slipped&#10;after Wild Dog softly, very softly, and hid himself where he could&#10;hear everything.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When Wild Dog reached the mouth of the Cave he lifted up the&#10;dried horse-skin with his nose and sniffed the beautiful smell of&#10;the roast mutton, and the Woman, looking at the blade-bone, heard&#10;him, and laughed, and said, &#39;Here comes the first. Wild Thing out&#10;of the Wild Woods, what do you want?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Wild Dog said, &#39;O my Enemy and Wife of my Enemy, what is this&#10;that smells so good in the Wild Woods?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then the Woman picked up a roasted mutton-bone and threw it to&#10;Wild Dog, and said, &#39;Wild Thing out of the Wild Woods, taste and&#10;try.&#39; Wild Dog gnawed the bone, and it was more delicious than&#10;anything he had ever tasted, and he said, &#39;O my Enemy and Wife of&#10;my Enemy, give me another.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Woman said, &#39;Wild Thing out of the Wild Woods, help my Man&#10;to hunt through the day and guard this Cave at night, and I will&#10;give you as many roast bones as you need.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Ah!&#39; said the Cat, listening. &#39;This is a very wise Woman, but&#10;she is not so wise as I am.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Wild Dog crawled into the Cave and laid his head on the Woman&#39;s&#10;lap, and said, &#39;O my Friend and Wife of my Friend, I will help Your&#10;Man to hunt through the day, and at night I will guard your&#10;Cave.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Ah!&#39; said the Cat, listening. &#39;That is a very foolish Dog.&#39; And&#10;he went back through the Wet Wild Woods waving his wild tail, and&#10;walking by his wild lone. But he never told anybody.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When the Man waked up he said, &#39;What is Wild Dog doing here?&#39;&#10;And the Woman said, &#39;His name is not Wild Dog any more, but the&#10;First Friend, because he will be our friend for always and always&#10;and always. Take him with you when you go hunting.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Next night the Woman cut great green armfuls of fresh grass from&#10;the water-meadows, and dried it before the fire, so that it smelt&#10;like new-mown hay, and she sat at the mouth of the Cave and plaited&#10;a halter out of horse-hide, and she looked at the shoulder of&#10;mutton-bone&#8212;at the big broad blade-bone&#8212;and she made a Magic. She&#10;made the Second Singing Magic in the world.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Out in the Wild Woods all the wild animals wondered what had&#10;happened to Wild Dog, and at last Wild Horse stamped with his foot&#10;and said, &#39;I will go and see and say why Wild Dog has not returned.&#10;Cat, come with me.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Nenni!&#39; said the Cat. &#39;I am the Cat who walks by himself, and&#10;all places are alike to me. I will not come.&#39; But all the same he&#10;followed Wild Horse softly, very softly, and hid himself where he&#10;could hear everything.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When the Woman heard Wild Horse tripping and stumbling on his&#10;long mane, she laughed and said, &#39;Here comes the second. Wild Thing&#10;out of the Wild Woods what do you want?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Wild Horse said, &#39;O my Enemy and Wife of my Enemy, where is Wild&#10;Dog?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Woman laughed, and picked up the blade-bone and looked at&#10;it, and said, &#39;Wild Thing out of the Wild Woods, you did not come&#10;here for Wild Dog, but for the sake of this good grass.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And Wild Horse, tripping and stumbling on his long mane, said,&#10;&#39;That is true; give it me to eat.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Woman said, &#39;Wild Thing out of the Wild Woods, bend your&#10;wild head and wear what I give you, and you shall eat the wonderful&#10;grass three times a day.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Ah,&#39; said the Cat, listening, &#39;this is a clever Woman, but she&#10;is not so clever as I am.&#39; Wild Horse bent his wild head, and the&#10;Woman slipped the plaited hide halter over it, and Wild Horse&#10;breathed on the Woman&#39;s feet and said, &#39;O my Mistress, and Wife of&#10;my Master, I will be your servant for the sake of the wonderful&#10;grass.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Ah,&#39; said the Cat, listening, &#39;that is a very foolish Horse.&#39;&#10;And he went back through the Wet Wild Woods, waving his wild tail&#10;and walking by his wild lone. But he never told anybody.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When the Man and the Dog came back from hunting, the Man said,&#10;&#39;What is Wild Horse doing here?&#39; And the Woman said, &#39;His name is&#10;not Wild Horse any more, but the First Servant, because he will&#10;carry us from place to place for always and always and always. Ride&#10;on his back when you go hunting.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Next day, holding her wild head high that her wild horns should&#10;not catch in the wild trees, Wild Cow came up to the Cave, and the&#10;Cat followed, and hid himself just the same as before; and&#10;everything happened just the same as before; and the Cat said the&#10;same things as before, and when Wild Cow had promised to give her&#10;milk to the Woman every day in exchange for the wonderful grass,&#10;the Cat went back through the Wet Wild Woods waving his wild tail&#10;and walking by his wild lone, just the same as before. But he never&#10;told anybody. And when the Man and the Horse and the Dog came home&#10;from hunting and asked the same questions same as before, the Woman&#10;said, &#39;Her name is not Wild Cow any more, but the Giver of Good&#10;Food. She will give us the warm white milk for always and always&#10;and always, and I will take care of her while you and the First&#10;Friend and the First Servant go hunting.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Next day the Cat waited to see if any other Wild thing would go&#10;up to the Cave, but no one moved in the Wet Wild Woods, so the Cat&#10;walked there by himself; and he saw the Woman milking the Cow, and&#10;he saw the light of the fire in the Cave, and he smelt the smell of&#10;the warm white milk.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Cat said, &#39;O my Enemy and Wife of my Enemy, where did Wild Cow&#10;go?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Woman laughed and said, &#39;Wild Thing out of the Wild Woods,&#10;go back to the Woods again, for I have braided up my hair, and I&#10;have put away the magic blade-bone, and we have no more need of&#10;either friends or servants in our Cave.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Cat said, &#39;I am not a friend, and I am not a servant. I am the&#10;Cat who walks by himself, and I wish to come into your cave.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Woman said, &#39;Then why did you not come with First Friend on the&#10;first night?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Cat grew very angry and said, &#39;Has Wild Dog told tales of&#10;me?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then the Woman laughed and said, &#39;You are the Cat who walks by&#10;himself, and all places are alike to you. Your are neither a friend&#10;nor a servant. You have said it yourself. Go away and walk by&#10;yourself in all places alike.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then Cat pretended to be sorry and said, &#39;Must I never come into&#10;the Cave? Must I never sit by the warm fire? Must I never drink the&#10;warm white milk? You are very wise and very beautiful. You should&#10;not be cruel even to a Cat.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Woman said, &#39;I knew I was wise, but I did not know I was&#10;beautiful. So I will make a bargain with you. If ever I say one&#10;word in your praise you may come into the Cave.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;And if you say two words in my praise?&#39; said the Cat.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;I never shall,&#39; said the Woman, &#39;but if I say two words in your&#10;praise, you may sit by the fire in the Cave.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;And if you say three words?&#39; said the Cat.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;I never shall,&#39; said the Woman, &#39;but if I say three words in&#10;your praise, you may drink the warm white milk three times a day&#10;for always and always and always.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then the Cat arched his back and said, &#39;Now let the Curtain at&#10;the mouth of the Cave, and the Fire at the back of the Cave, and&#10;the Milk-pots that stand beside the Fire, remember what my Enemy&#10;and the Wife of my Enemy has said.&#39; And he went away through the&#10;Wet Wild Woods waving his wild tail and walking by his wild&#10;lone.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;That night when the Man and the Horse and the Dog came home from&#10;hunting, the Woman did not tell them of the bargain that she had&#10;made with the Cat, because she was afraid that they might not like&#10;it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Cat went far and far away and hid himself in the Wet Wild Woods&#10;by his wild lone for a long time till the Woman forgot all about&#10;him. Only the Bat&#8212;the little upside-down Bat&#8212;that hung inside the&#10;Cave, knew where Cat hid; and every evening Bat would fly to Cat&#10;with news of what was happening.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;One evening Bat said, &#39;There is a Baby in the Cave. He is new&#10;and pink and fat and small, and the Woman is very fond of him.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Ah,&#39; said the Cat, listening, &#39;but what is the Baby fond&#10;of?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;He is fond of things that are soft and tickle,&#39; said the Bat.&#10;&#39;He is fond of warm things to hold in his arms when he goes to&#10;sleep. He is fond of being played with. He is fond of all those&#10;things.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Ah,&#39; said the Cat, listening, &#39;then my time has come.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Next night Cat walked through the Wet Wild Woods and hid very&#10;near the Cave till morning-time, and Man and Dog and Horse went&#10;hunting. The Woman was busy cooking that morning, and the Baby&#10;cried and interrupted. So she carried him outside the Cave and gave&#10;him a handful of pebbles to play with. But still the Baby&#10;cried.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then the Cat put out his paddy paw and patted the Baby on the&#10;cheek, and it cooed; and the Cat rubbed against its fat knees and&#10;tickled it under its fat chin with his tail. And the Baby laughed;&#10;and the Woman heard him and smiled.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then the Bat&#8212;the little upside-down bat&#8212;that hung in the mouth&#10;of the Cave said, &#39;O my Hostess and Wife of my Host and Mother of&#10;my Host&#39;s Son, a Wild Thing from the Wild Woods is most beautifully&#10;playing with your Baby.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;A blessing on that Wild Thing whoever he may be,&#39; said the&#10;Woman, straightening her back, &#39;for I was a busy woman this morning&#10;and he has done me a service.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;That very minute and second, Best Beloved, the dried horse-skin&#10;Curtain that was stretched tail-down at the mouth of the Cave fell&#10;down&#8212;whoosh!&#8212;because it remembered the bargain she had made with&#10;the Cat, and when the Woman went to pick it up&#8212;lo and behold!&#8212;the&#10;Cat was sitting quite comfy inside the Cave.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;O my Enemy and Wife of my Enemy and Mother of my Enemy,&#39; said&#10;the Cat, &#39;it is I: for you have spoken a word in my praise, and now&#10;I can sit within the Cave for always and always and always. But&#10;still I am the Cat who walks by himself, and all places are alike&#10;to me.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Woman was very angry, and shut her lips tight and took up&#10;her spinning-wheel and began to spin. But the Baby cried because&#10;the Cat had gone away, and the Woman could not hush it, for it&#10;struggled and kicked and grew black in the face.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;O my Enemy and Wife of my Enemy and Mother of my Enemy,&#39; said&#10;the Cat, &#39;take a strand of the wire that you are spinning and tie&#10;it to your spinning-whorl and drag it along the floor, and I will&#10;show you a magic that shall make your Baby laugh as loudly as he is&#10;now crying.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;I will do so,&#39; said the Woman, &#39;because I am at my wits&#39; end;&#10;but I will not thank you for it.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She tied the thread to the little clay spindle whorl and drew it&#10;across the floor, and the Cat ran after it and patted it with his&#10;paws and rolled head over heels, and tossed it backward over his&#10;shoulder and chased it between his hind-legs and pretended to lose&#10;it, and pounced down upon it again, till the Baby laughed as loudly&#10;as it had been crying, and scrambled after the Cat and frolicked&#10;all over the Cave till it grew tired and settled down to sleep with&#10;the Cat in its arms.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Now,&#39; said the Cat, &#39;I will sing the Baby a song that shall&#10;keep him asleep for an hour. And he began to purr, loud and low,&#10;low and loud, till the Baby fell fast asleep. The Woman smiled as&#10;she looked down upon the two of them and said, &#39;That was&#10;wonderfully done. No question but you are very clever, O Cat.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;That very minute and second, Best Beloved, the smoke of the fire&#10;at the back of the Cave came down in clouds from the&#10;roof&#8212;puff!&#8212;because it remembered the bargain she had made with the&#10;Cat, and when it had cleared away&#8212;lo and behold!&#8212;the Cat was&#10;sitting quite comfy close to the fire.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;O my Enemy and Wife of my Enemy and Mother of My Enemy,&#39; said&#10;the Cat, &#39;it is I, for you have spoken a second word in my praise,&#10;and now I can sit by the warm fire at the back of the Cave for&#10;always and always and always. But still I am the Cat who walks by&#10;himself, and all places are alike to me.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then the Woman was very very angry, and let down her hair and&#10;put more wood on the fire and brought out the broad blade-bone of&#10;the shoulder of mutton and began to make a Magic that should&#10;prevent her from saying a third word in praise of the Cat. It was&#10;not a Singing Magic, Best Beloved, it was a Still Magic; and by and&#10;by the Cave grew so still that a little wee-wee mouse crept out of&#10;a corner and ran across the floor.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;O my Enemy and Wife of my Enemy and Mother of my Enemy,&#39; said&#10;the Cat, &#39;is that little mouse part of your magic?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Ouh! Chee! No indeed!&#39; said the Woman, and she dropped the&#10;blade-bone and jumped upon the footstool in front of the fire and&#10;braided up her hair very quick for fear that the mouse should run&#10;up it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Ah,&#39; said the Cat, watching, &#39;then the mouse will do me no harm&#10;if I eat it?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;No,&#39; said the Woman, braiding up her hair, &#39;eat it quickly and&#10;I will ever be grateful to you.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Cat made one jump and caught the little mouse, and the Woman&#10;said, &#39;A hundred thanks. Even the First Friend is not quick enough&#10;to catch little mice as you have done. You must be very wise.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;That very moment and second, O Best Beloved, the Milk-pot that&#10;stood by the fire cracked in two pieces&#8212;ffft&#8212;because it remembered&#10;the bargain she had made with the Cat, and when the Woman jumped&#10;down from the footstool&#8212;lo and behold!&#8212;the Cat was lapping up the&#10;warm white milk that lay in one of the broken pieces.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;O my Enemy and Wife of my Enemy and Mother of my Enemy, said&#10;the Cat, &#39;it is I; for you have spoken three words in my praise,&#10;and now I can drink the warm white milk three times a day for&#10;always and always and always. But still I am the Cat who walks by&#10;himself, and all places are alike to me.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then the Woman laughed and set the Cat a bowl of the warm white&#10;milk and said, &#39;O Cat, you are as clever as a man, but remember&#10;that your bargain was not made with the Man or the Dog, and I do&#10;not know what they will do when they come home.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;What is that to me?&#39; said the Cat. &#39;If I have my place in the&#10;Cave by the fire and my warm white milk three times a day I do not&#10;care what the Man or the Dog can do.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;That evening when the Man and the Dog came into the Cave, the&#10;Woman told them all the story of the bargain while the Cat sat by&#10;the fire and smiled. Then the Man said, &#39;Yes, but he has not made a&#10;bargain with me or with all proper Men after me.&#39; Then he took off&#10;his two leather boots and he took up his little stone axe (that&#10;makes three) and he fetched a piece of wood and a hatchet (that is&#10;five altogether), and he set them out in a row and he said, &#39;Now we&#10;will make our bargain. If you do not catch mice when you are in the&#10;Cave for always and always and always, I will throw these five&#10;things at you whenever I see you, and so shall all proper Men do&#10;after me.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Ah,&#39; said the Woman, listening, &#39;this is a very clever Cat, but&#10;he is not so clever as my Man.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Cat counted the five things (and they looked very knobby)&#10;and he said, &#39;I will catch mice when I am in the Cave for always&#10;and always and always; but still I am the Cat who walks by himself,&#10;and all places are alike to me.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Not when I am near,&#39; said the Man. &#39;If you had not said that&#10;last I would have put all these things away for always and always&#10;and always; but I am now going to throw my two boots and my little&#10;stone axe (that makes three) at you whenever I meet you. And so&#10;shall all proper Men do after me!&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then the Dog said, &#39;Wait a minute. He has not made a bargain&#10;with me or with all proper Dogs after me.&#39; And he showed his teeth&#10;and said, &#39;If you are not kind to the Baby while I am in the Cave&#10;for always and always and always, I will hunt you till I catch you,&#10;and when I catch you I will bite you. And so shall all proper Dogs&#10;do after me.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Ah,&#39; said the Woman, listening, &#39;this is a very clever Cat, but&#10;he is not so clever as the Dog.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Cat counted the Dog&#39;s teeth (and they looked very pointed) and&#10;he said, &#39;I will be kind to the Baby while I am in the Cave, as&#10;long as he does not pull my tail too hard, for always and always&#10;and always. But still I am the Cat that walks by himself, and all&#10;places are alike to me.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Not when I am near,&#39; said the Dog. &#39;If you had not said that&#10;last I would have shut my mouth for always and always and always;&#10;but now I am going to hunt you up a tree whenever I meet you. And&#10;so shall all proper Dogs do after me.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then the Man threw his two boots and his little stone axe (that&#10;makes three) at the Cat, and the Cat ran out of the Cave and the&#10;Dog chased him up a tree; and from that day to this, Best Beloved,&#10;three proper Men out of five will always throw things at a Cat&#10;whenever they meet him, and all proper Dogs will chase him up a&#10;tree. But the Cat keeps his side of the bargain too. He will kill&#10;mice and he will be kind to Babies when he is in the house, just as&#10;long as they do not pull his tail too hard. But when he has done&#10;that, and between times, and when the moon gets up and night comes,&#10;he is the Cat that walks by himself, and all places are alike to&#10;him. Then he goes out to the Wet Wild Woods or up the Wet Wild&#10;Trees or on the Wet Wild Roofs, waving his wild tail and walking by&#10;his wild lone.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;PUSSY can sit by the fire and sing,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;Pussy can climb a tree,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Or play with a silly old cork and string&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;To&#39;muse herself, not me.&#60;br /&#62;&#10;But I like Binkie my dog, because&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;He Lnows how to behave;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;So, Binkie&#39;s the same as the First Friend was,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;And I am the Man in the Cave.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Pussy will play man-Friday till&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;It&#39;s time to wet her paw&#60;br /&#62;&#10;And make her walk on the window-sill&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;(For the footprint Crusoe saw);&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Then she fluffles her tail and mews,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;And scratches and won&#39;t attend.&#60;br /&#62;&#10;But Binkie will play whatever I choose,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;And he is my true First Friend.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Pussy will rub my knees with her head&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;Pretending she loves me hard;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;But the very minute I go to my bed&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;Pussy runs out in the yard,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;And there she stays till the morning-light;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;So I know it is only pretend;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;But Binkie, he snores at my feet all night,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;And he is my Firstest Friend!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 10, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/865', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Butterfly that Stamped'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;THIS, O my Best Beloved, is a story&#8212;a new and a wonderful&#10;story&#8212;a story quite different from the other stories&#8212;a story about&#10;The Most Wise Sovereign Suleiman-bin-Daoud&#8212;Solomon the Son of&#10;David.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There are three hundred and fifty-five stories about&#10;Suleiman-bin-Daoud; but this is not one of them. It is not the&#10;story of the Lapwing who found the Water; or the Hoopoe who shaded&#10;Suleimanbin-Daoud from the heat. It is not the story of the Glass&#10;Pavement, or the Ruby with the Crooked Hole, or the Gold Bars of&#10;Balkis. It is the story of the Butterfly that Stamped.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now attend all over again and listen!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Suleiman-bin-Daoud was wise. He understood what the beasts said,&#10;what the birds said, what the fishes said, and what the insects&#10;said. He understood what the rocks said deep under the earth when&#10;they bowed in towards each other and groaned; and he understood&#10;what the trees said when they rustled in the middle of the morning.&#10;He understood everything, from the bishop on the bench to the&#10;hyssop on the wall, and Balkis, his Head Queen, the Most Beautiful&#10;Queen Balkis, was nearly as wise as he was.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Suleiman-bin-Daoud was strong. Upon the third finger of the&#10;right hand he wore a ring. When he turned it once, Afrits and&#10;Djinns came Out of the earth to do whatever he told them. When he&#10;turned it twice, Fairies came down from the sky to do whatever he&#10;told them; and when he turned it three times, the very great angel&#10;Azrael of the Sword came dressed as a water-carrier, and told him&#10;the news of the three worlds, Above&#8212;Below&#8212;and Here.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And yet Suleiman-bin-Daoud was not proud. He very seldom showed&#10;off, and when he did he was sorry for it. Once he tried to feed all&#10;the animals in all the world in one day, but when the food was&#10;ready an Animal came out of the deep sea and ate it up in three&#10;mouthfuls. Suleiman-bin-Daoud was very surprised and said, &#39;O&#10;Animal, who are you?&#39; And the Animal said, &#39;O King, live for ever!&#10;I am the smallest of thirty thousand brothers, and our home is at&#10;the bottom of the sea. We heard that you were going to feed all the&#10;animals in all the world, and my brothers sent me to ask when&#10;dinner would be ready.&#39; Suleiman-bin-Daoud was more surprised than&#10;ever and said, &#39;O Animal, you have eaten all the dinner that I made&#10;ready for all the animals in the world.&#39; And the Animal said, &#39;O&#10;King, live for ever, but do you really call that a dinner? Where I&#10;come from we each eat twice as much as that between meals.&#39; Then&#10;Suleiman-bin-Daoud fell flat on his face and said, &#39;O Animal! I&#10;gave that dinner to show what a great and rich king I was, and not&#10;because I really wanted to be kind to the animals. Now I am&#10;ashamed, and it serves me right. Suleiman-bin-Daoud was a really&#10;truly wise man, Best Beloved. After that he never forgot that it&#10;was silly to show off; and now the real story part of my story&#10;begins.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He married ever so many wifes. He married nine hundred and&#10;ninety-nine wives, besides the Most Beautiful Balkis; and they all&#10;lived in a great golden palace in the middle of a lovely garden&#10;with fountains. He didn&#39;t really want nine-hundred and ninety-nine&#10;wives, but in those days everybody married ever so many wives, and&#10;of course the King had to marry ever so many more just to show that&#10;he was the King.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Some of the wives were nice, but some were simply horrid, and&#10;the horrid ones quarrelled with the nice ones and made them horrid&#10;too, and then they would all quarrel with Suleiman-bin-Daoud, and&#10;that was horrid for him. But Balkis the Most Beautiful never&#10;quarrelled with Suleiman-bin-Daoud. She loved him too much. She sat&#10;in her rooms in the Golden Palace, or walked in the Palace garden,&#10;and was truly sorry for him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Of course if he had chosen to turn his ring on his finger and&#10;call up the Djinns and the Afrits they would have magicked all&#10;those nine hundred and ninety-nine quarrelsome wives into white&#10;mules of the desert or greyhounds or pomegranate seeds; but&#10;Suleiman-bin-Daoud thought that that would be showing off. So, when&#10;they quarrelled too much, he only walked by himself in one part of&#10;the beautiful Palace gardens and wished he had never been born.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;One day, when they had quarrelled for three weeks&#8212;all nine&#10;hundred and ninety-nine wives together&#8212;Suleiman-bin-Daoud went out&#10;for peace and quiet as usual; and among the orange trees he met&#10;Balkis the Most Beautiful, very sorrowful because&#10;Suleiman-bin-Daoud was so worried. And she said to him, &#39;O my Lord&#10;and Light of my Eyes, turn the ring upon your finger and show these&#10;Queens of Egypt and Mesopotamia and Persia and China that you are&#10;the great and terrible King.&#39; But Suleiman-bin-Daoud shook his head&#10;and said, &#39;O my Lady and Delight of my Life, remember the Animal&#10;that came out of the sea and made me ashamed before all the animals&#10;in all the world because I showed off. Now, if I showed off before&#10;these Queens of Persia and Egypt and Abyssinia and China, merely&#10;because they worry me, I might be made even more ashamed than I&#10;have been.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And Balkis the Most Beautiful said, &#39;O my Lord and Treasure of&#10;my Soul, what will you do?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And Suleiman-bin-Daoud said, &#39;O my Lady and Content of my Heart,&#10;I shall continue to endure my fate at the hands of these nine&#10;hundred and ninety-nine Queens who vex me with their continual&#10;quarrelling.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So he went on between the lilies and the loquats and the roses&#10;and the cannas and the heavy-scented ginger-plants that grew in the&#10;garden, till he came to the great camphor-tree that was called the&#10;Camphor Tree of Suleiman-bin-Daoud. But Balkis hid among the tall&#10;irises and the spotted bamboos and the red lillies behind the&#10;camphor-tree, so as to be near her own true love,&#10;Suleiman-bin-Daoud.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Presently two Butterflies flew under the tree, quarrelling.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Suleiman-bin-Daoud heard one say to the other, &#39;I wonder at your&#10;presumption in talking like this to me. Don&#39;t you know that if I&#10;stamped with my foot all Suleiman-bin-Daoud&#39;s Palace and this&#10;garden here would immediately vanish in a clap of thunder.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then Suleiman-bin-Daoud forgot his nine hundred and ninety-nine&#10;bothersome wives, and laughed, till the camphor-tree shook, at the&#10;Butterfly&#39;s boast. And he held out his finger and said, &#39;Little&#10;man, come here.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Butterfly was dreadfully frightened, but he managed to fly&#10;up to the hand of Suleiman-bin-Daoud, and clung there, fanning&#10;himself. Suleiman-bin-Daoud bent his head and whispered very&#10;softly, &#39;Little man, you know that all your stamping wouldn&#39;t bend&#10;one blade of grass. What made you tell that awful fib to your&#10;wife?&#8212;for doubtless she is your wife.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Butterfly looked at Suleiman-bin-Daoud and saw the most wise&#10;King&#39;s eye twinkle like stars on a frosty night, and he picked up&#10;his courage with both wings, and he put his head on one side and&#10;said, &#39;O King, live for ever. She is my wife; and you know what&#10;wives are like.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Suleiman-bin-Daoud smiled in his beard and said, &#39;Yes, I know,&#10;little brother.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;One must keep them in order somehow, said the Butterfly, and&#10;she has been quarrelling with me all the morning. I said that to&#10;quiet her.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And Suleiman-bin-Daoud said, &#39;May it quiet her. Go back to your&#10;wife, little brother, and let me hear what you say.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Back flew the Butterfly to his wife, who was all of a twitter&#10;behind a leaf, and she said, &#39;He heard you! Suleiman-bin-Daoud&#10;himself heard you!&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Heard me!&#39; said the Butterfly. &#39;Of course he did. I meant him&#10;to hear me.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;And what did he say? Oh, what did he say?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Well,&#39; said the Butterfly, fanning himself most importantly,&#10;&#39;between you and me, my dear&#8212;of course I don&#39;t blame him, because&#10;his Palace must have cost a great deal and the oranges are just&#10;ripening,&#8212;he asked me not to stamp, and I promised I wouldn&#39;t.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Gracious!&#39; said his wife, and sat quite quiet; but&#10;Suleiman-bin-Daoud laughed till the tears ran down his face at the&#10;impudence of the bad little Butterfly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Balkis the Most Beautiful stood up behind the tree among the red&#10;lilies and smiled to herself, for she had heard all this talk. She&#10;thought, &#39;If I am wise I can yet save my Lord from the persecutions&#10;of these quarrelsome Queens,&#39; and she held out her finger and&#10;whispered softly to the Butterfly&#39;s Wife, &#39;Little woman, come&#10;here.&#39; Up flew the Butterfly&#39;s Wife, very frightened, and clung to&#10;Balkis&#39;s white hand.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Balkis bent her beautiful head down and whispered, &#39;Little&#10;woman, do you believe what your husband has just said?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Butterfly&#39;s Wife looked at Balkis, and saw the most&#10;beautiful Queen&#39;s eyes shining like deep pools with starlight on&#10;them, and she picked up her courage with both wings and said, &#39;O&#10;Queen, be lovely for ever. You know what men-folk are like.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And the Queen Balkis, the Wise Balkis of Sheba, put her hand to&#10;her lips to hide a smile and said, &#39;Little sister, I know.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;They get angry,&#39; said the Butterfly&#39;s Wife, fanning herself&#10;quickly, &#39;over nothing at all, but we must humour them, O Queen.&#10;They never mean half they say. If it pleases my husband to believe&#10;that I believe he can make Suleiman-bin-Daoud&#39;s Palace disappear by&#10;stamping his foot, I&#39;m sure I don&#39;t care. He&#39;ll forget all about it&#10;to-morrow.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Little sister,&#39; said Balkis, &#39;you are quite right; but next&#10;time he begins to boast, take him at his word. Ask him to stamp,&#10;and see what will happen. We know what men-folk are like, don&#39;t we?&#10;He&#39;ll be very much ashamed.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Away flew the Butterfly&#39;s Wife to her husband, and in five&#10;minutes they were quarrelling worse than ever.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Remember!&#39; said the Butterfly. &#39;Remember what I can do if I&#10;stamp my foot.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;I don&#39;t believe you one little bit,&#39; said the Butterfly&#39;s Wife.&#10;&#39;I should very much like to see it done. Suppose you stamp&#10;now.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;I promised Suleiman-bin-Daoud that I wouldn&#39;t,&#39; said the&#10;Butterfly, &#39;and I don&#39;t want to break my promise.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;It wouldn&#39;t matter if you did,&#39; said his wife. &#39;You couldn&#39;t&#10;bend a blade of grass with your stamping. I dare you to do it,&#39; she&#10;said. Stamp! Stamp! Stamp!&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Suleiman-bin-Daoud, sitting under the camphor-tree, heard every&#10;word of this, and he laughed as he had never laughed in his life&#10;before. He forgot all about his Queens; he forgot all about the&#10;Animal that came out of the sea; he forgot about showing off. He&#10;just laughed with joy, and Balkis, on the other side of the tree,&#10;smiled because her own true love was so joyful.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Presently the Butterfly, very hot and puffy, came whirling back&#10;under the shadow of the camphor-tree and said to Suleiman, &#39;She&#10;wants me to stamp! She wants to see what will happen, O&#10;Suleiman-bin-Daoud! You know I can&#39;t do it, and now she&#39;ll never&#10;believe a word I say. She&#39;ll laugh at me to the end of my&#10;days!&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;No, little brother,&#39; said Suleiman-bin-Daoud, &#39;she will never&#10;laugh at you again,&#39; and he turned the ring on his finger&#8212;just for&#10;the little Butterfly&#39;s sake, not for the sake of showing off,&#8212;and,&#10;lo and behold, four huge Djinns came out of the earth!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Slaves,&#39; said Suleiman-bin-Daoud, &#39;when this gentleman on my&#10;finger&#39; (that was where the impudent Butterfly was sitting) &#39;stamps&#10;his left front forefoot you will make my Palace and these gardens&#10;disappear in a clap of thunder. When he stamps again you will bring&#10;them back carefully.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Now, little brother,&#39; he said, &#39;go back to your wife and stamp&#10;all you&#39;ve a mind to.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Away flew the Butterfly to his wife, who was crying, &#39;I dare you&#10;to do it! I dare you to do it! Stamp! Stamp now! Stamp!&#39; Balkis saw&#10;the four vast Djinns stoop down to the four corners of the gardens&#10;with the Palace in the middle, and she clapped her hands softly and&#10;said, &#39;At last Suleiman-bin-Daoud will do for the sake of a&#10;Butterfly what he ought to have done long ago for his own sake, and&#10;the quarrelsome Queens will be frightened!&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The the butterfly stamped. The Djinns jerked the Palace and the&#10;gardens a thousand miles into the air: there was a most awful&#10;thunder-clap, and everything grew inky-black. The Butterfly&#39;s Wife&#10;fluttered about in the dark, crying, &#39;Oh, I&#39;ll be good! I&#39;m so&#10;sorry I spoke. Only bring the gardens back, my dear darling&#10;husband, and I&#39;ll never contradict again.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Butterfly was nearly as frightened as his wife, and&#10;Suleiman-bin-Daoud laughed so much that it was several minutes&#10;before he found breath enough to whisper to the Butterfly, &#39;Stamp&#10;again, little brother. Give me back my Palace, most great&#10;magician.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Yes, give him back his Palace,&#39; said the Butterfly&#39;s Wife,&#10;still flying about in the dark like a moth. &#39;Give him back his&#10;Palace, and don&#39;t let&#39;s have any more horrid.magic.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Well, my dear,&#39; said the Butterfly as bravely as he could, &#39;you&#10;see what your nagging has led to. Of course it doesn&#39;t make any&#10;difference to me&#8212;I&#39;m used to this kind of thing&#8212;but as a favour to&#10;you and to Suleiman-bin-Daoud I don&#39;t mind putting things&#10;right.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So he stamped once more, and that instant the Djinns let down&#10;the Palace and the gardens, without even a bump. The sun shone on&#10;the dark-green orange leaves; the fountains played among the pink&#10;Egyptian lilies; the birds went on singing, and the Butterfly&#39;s&#10;Wife lay on her side under the camphor-tree waggling her wings and&#10;panting, &#39;Oh, I&#39;ll be good! I&#39;ll be good!&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Suleiman-bin-Daolld could hardly speak for laughing. He leaned&#10;back all weak and hiccoughy, and shook his finger at the Butterfly&#10;and said, &#39;O great wizard, what is the sense of returning to me my&#10;Palace if at the same time you slay me with mirth!&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then came a terrible noise, for all the nine hundred and&#10;ninety-nine Queens ran out of the Palace shrieking and shouting and&#10;calling for their babies. They hurried down the great marble steps&#10;below the fountain, one hundred abreast, and the Most Wise Balkis&#10;went statelily forward to meet them and said, &#39;What is your&#10;trouble, O Queens?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;They stood on the marble steps one hundred abreast and shouted,&#10;&#39;What is our trouble? We were living peacefully in our golden&#10;palace, as is our custom, when upon a sudden the Palace&#10;disappeared, and we were left sitting in a thick and noisome&#10;darkness; and it thundered, and Djinns and Afrits moved about in&#10;the darkness! That is our trouble, O Head Queen, and we are most&#10;extremely troubled on account of that trouble, for it was a&#10;troublesome trouble, unlike any trouble we have known.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then Balkis the Most Beautiful Queen&#8212;Suleiman-bin-Daoud&#39;s Very&#10;Best Beloved&#8212;Queen that was of Sheba and Sable and the Rivers of&#10;the Gold of the South&#8212;from the Desert of Zinn to the Towers of&#10;Zimbabwe&#8212;Balkis, almost as wise as the Most Wise Suleiman-bin-Daoud&#10;himself, said, &#39;It is nothing, O Queens! A Butterfly has made&#10;complaint against his wife because she quarrelled with him, and it&#10;has pleased our Lord Suleiman-bin-Daoud to teach her a lesson in&#10;low-speaking and humbleness, for that is counted a virtue among the&#10;wives of the butterflies.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then up and spoke an Egyptian Queen&#8212;the daughter of a&#10;Pharoah&#8212;and she said, &#39;Our Palace cannot be plucked up by the roots&#10;like a leek for the sake of a little insect. No! Suleiman-bin-Daoud&#10;must be dead, and what we heard and saw was the earth thundering&#10;and darkening at the news.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then Balkis beckoned that bold Queen without looking at her, and&#10;said to her and to the others, &#39;Come and see.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;They came down the marble steps, one hundred abreast, and&#10;beneath his camphor-tree, still weak with laughing, they saw the&#10;Most Wise King Suleiman-bin-Daoud rocking back and forth with a&#10;Butterfly on either hand, and they heard him say, &#39;O wife of my&#10;brother in the air, remember after this, to please your husband in&#10;all things, lest he be provoked to stamp his foot yet again; for he&#10;has said that he is used to this magic, and he is most eminently a&#10;great magician&#8212;one who steals away the very Palace of&#10;Suleirnan-bin-Daoud himself. Go in peace, little folk!&#39; And he&#10;kissed them on the wings, and they flew away.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then all the Queens except Balkis&#8212;the Most Beautiful and&#10;Splendid Balkis, who stood apart smiling&#8212;fell flat on their faces,&#10;for they said, &#39;If these things are done when a Butterfly is&#10;displeased with his wife, what shall be done to us who have vexed&#10;our King with our loud-speaking and open quarrelling through many&#10;days?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then they put their veils over their heads, and they put their&#10;hands over their mouths, and they tiptoed back to the Palace most&#10;mousy-quiet.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then Balkis&#8212;The Most Beautiful and Excellent Balkis&#8212;went forward&#10;through the red lilies into the shade of the camphor-tree and laid&#10;her hand upon Suleiman-bin-Daoud&#39;s shoulder and said, &#39;O my Lord&#10;and Treasure of my Soul, rejoice, for we have taught the Queens of&#10;Egypt and Ethiopia and Abyssinia and Persia and India and China&#10;with a great and a memorable teaching.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And Suleiman-bin-Daoud, still looking after the Butterflies&#10;where they played in the sunlight, said, &#39;O my Lady and Jewel of my&#10;Felicity, when did this happen? For I have been jesting with a&#10;Butterfly ever since I came into the garden.&#39; And he told Balkis&#10;what he had done.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Balkis&#8212;The tender and Most Lovely Balkis&#8212;said, &#39;O my Lord and&#10;Regent of my Existence, I hid behind the camphor-tree and saw it&#10;all. It was I who told the Butterfly&#39;s Wife to ask the Butterfly to&#10;stamp, because I hoped that for the sake of the jest my Lord would&#10;make some great magic and that the Queens would see it and be&#10;frightened.&#39; And she told him what the Queens had said and seen and&#10;thought.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then Suleiman-bin-Daoud rose up from his seat under the&#10;camphor-tree, and stretched his arms and rejoiced and said, &#39;O my&#10;Lady and Sweetener of my Days, know that if I had made a magic&#10;against my Queens for the sake of pride or anger, as I made that&#10;feast for all the animals, I should certainly have been put to&#10;shame. But by means of your wisdom I made the magic for the sake of&#10;a jest and for the sake of a little Butterfly, and&#8212;behold&#8212;it has&#10;also delivered me from the vexations of my vexatious wives! Tell&#10;me, therefore, O my Lady and Heart of my Heart, how did you come to&#10;be so wise?&#39; And Balkis the Queen, beautiful and tall, looked up&#10;into Suleiman-bin-Daoud&#39;s eyes and put her head a little on one&#10;side, just like the Butterfly, and said, &#39;First, O my Lord, because&#10;I loved you; and secondly, O my Lord, because I know what&#10;women-folk are.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then they went up to the Palace and lived happily ever&#10;afterwards.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But wasn&#39;t it clever of Balkis?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;THERE was never a Queen like Balkis,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;From here to the wide world&#39;s end;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;But Balkis tailed to a butterfly&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;As you would talk to a friend.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There was never a King like Solomon,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;Not since the world began;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;But Solomon talked to a butterfly&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;As a man would talk to a man.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She was Queen of Sabaea&#8212;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;And he was Asia&#39;s Lord&#8212;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;But they both of &#39;em talked to butterflies&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;&#38;#160;When they took their walks abroad!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 10, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/865', :deleted => 0)
