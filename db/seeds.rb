This was awful for Stan, just awful. He had loved Sheila&#10;for a long time, fought for her heart, believed in their love until&#10;finally she had come around. They were about to kiss for the first&#10;time and then this: yellow gumballs.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Stan went to a group to try to accept that Sheila was gone. It&#10;was a group for people whose unrequited love had ended in some kind&#10;of surrealist moment. There is a group for everything in&#10;California.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;After several months of hard work on himself with the group,&#10;Stan was ready to open a shop and sell the thousands of yellow&#10;gumballs. He did this because he believed in capitalism, he loved&#10;capitalism. He loved the dynamic surge and crash of Amazon&#8217;s stock&#10;price, he loved the great concrete malls spreading across America&#10;like blood staining through a handkerchief, he loved how everything&#10;could be tracked and mirrored in numbers. When he closed the store&#10;each night he would count the gumballs sold, and he would determine&#10;his gross revenue, his operating expenses, his operating margin; he&#10;would adjust his balance sheet and learn his debt-to-equity ratio;&#10;and after this exercise each night, Stan felt he understood himself&#10;and was at peace, and he could go home to his apartment and drink&#10;tea and sleep, without shooting himself or thinking about&#10;Sheila.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;On the night before the IPO of gumballs.com, Sheila came to Stan&#10;in a dream. She was standing in a kiddie pool; Stan and his&#10;brothers and sisters were running around splashing and screaming;&#10;she had managed to insert herself into a Super 8 home movie of&#10;Stan&#8217;s family, shot in the late seventies. She looked terribly&#10;sad.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Sheila, where are you?&#8221; Stan said. &#8220;Why did you leave me, why&#10;did you become gumballs?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;The Ant King has me,&#8221; Sheila said. &#8220;You must rescue me.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Stan woke up, he shaved, he put on his Armani suit, and drove&#10;his Lexus to his appointment with his venture capitalists and&#10;investment bankers. But the dream would not leave him. &#8220;Ant King?&#8221;&#10;he asked himself. &#8220;What&#8217;s this about a goddamn Ant King?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;On the highway, near the swamp, he pulled his Lexus over to the&#10;shoulder. The American highway is a self-contained system, Stan&#10;thought. Its rest stops have video games, bathrooms, restaurants,&#10;and gas stations. There&#8217;s no reason ever to leave the interstate&#10;highway system, its deadness and perfection and freedom. When you&#10;do reach your exit, you always have a slight sense of loss, as when&#10;awakening from a dream.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Stan took off his shiny black shoes and argyle socks, cuffed his&#10;Armani suit pants above the knees, and waded through the squidgy&#10;mud and tall reeds of the swamp. He saw a heron rise, flutter, and&#10;soar into the midmorning sky. Ant King, Ant King, he thought.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Miles underground, the Ant King was watching an old episode of&#10;C&#60;em&#62;h&#60;/em&#62;arlie&#8217;s An&#60;em&#62;g&#60;/em&#62;els on cable.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Which one do you identify with?&#8221; he asked Sheila. &#8220;The blonde&#10;one, or the pretty brunette one, or the perky, smart brunette&#10;one?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Stan may come rescue me, you know,&#8221; Sheila said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I like how you never see Charlie. And how Boswell&#8212;is that his&#10;name, Boswell?&#8212;how he&#8217;s kind of a foil and audience for the girls.&#10;There&#8217;s all this unrealized desire&#8212;Boswell desires the girls, but&#10;he&#8217;s got no chance, and I think they desire Charlie, but Charlie&#8217;s&#10;invisible.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Sheila picked at a seam in the orange sofa. &#8220;It is possible. He&#10;mi&#60;em&#62;gh&#60;/em&#62;t come rescue me.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Ant King blinked and tried to smile reassuringly. &#8220;Sure. No,&#10;yeah, definitely. I think the two of you are just going through a&#10;phase, maybe. You know, it took him a while to deal with, ah, what&#10;he&#8217;s going through.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Sheila glared at him. &#8220;You are so full of shit!&#8221; she said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Ant King threw his bag of Doritos at her. &#8220;Fine! I was just&#10;trying to be nice!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;I&#8217;m full of shit? I&#8217;m full of&#10;shit? What about your dorky boyfriend?&#8221; He grabbed the remote and&#10;changed the channel, showing Stan, sitting in his Lexus with the&#10;door open, toweling off his muddy feet. &#8220;He&#8217;s a lost cause, baby.&#10;You want me to respect a guy like that?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I hate it here,&#8221; said Sheila.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Ant King smoothed his antennae and took a deep breath.&#10;&#8220;Okay, I&#8217;m sorry about throwing the Doritos. Maybe I overreacted.&#10;Okay?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I hate you, too,&#8221; said Sheila.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Fine,&#8221; said the Ant King, savagely snatching up the remote&#10;control and turning back to C&#60;em&#62;h&#60;/em&#62;arlie&#8217;s An&#60;em&#62;g&#60;/em&#62;els. &#8220;Be&#10;that way.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Gumballs are more than candy, isn&#8217;t that right, Stan?&#8221; said&#10;Monique, smiling broadly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Stan nodded. His feet were still wet, inside his argyle socks.&#10;&#8220;Yes, gumballs have a lot of, ah, a lot greater significance than&#10;just candy.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Monique paused and looked at Stan brightly, waiting for him to&#10;go on. Across the table, the three Credit Suisse First Boston&#10;underwriters&#8212;Emilio Toad, Harry Hornpecker, and Moby Pfister&#8212;sat&#10;stone-faced and unreacting in their gray double-breasted suits.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Stan tried to remember the gumballs.com business plan. &#8220;They&#10;have hard shells,&#8221; he said. &#8220;People, ah, they want challenge&#38;#160;&#8230;&#10;the hardness, the gumminess&#38;#160;&#8230; &#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Monique broke in smoothly. Monique, all seven&#10;post-gender-reassignment-surgery feet of her; Monique, always&#10;dressed to the nines and tens; Monique was a Valley legend for her&#10;instincts, her suavity, her rapacious, exemplary greed. Stan had&#10;sold Monique on the idea of gumballs.com, and she had&#10;invested&#8212;found him the right contacts, the right team&#8212;and here they&#10;were at the Big Day, the Exit Strategy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Stan!&#8221; she cried joyously, fixing him with a penetrating stare.&#10;&#8220;Don&#8217;t be shy! Tell them about how gumballs are sex! Tell them&#10;about our top-gun semiotics professors, tell them about gumballs as&#10;a cultural trope! You see,&#8221; she said, swooping onto Hornpecker,&#10;Pfister &#38;amp; Toad, &#8220;you can&#8217;t think of this as a candy thing, a&#10;food &#38;amp; bev thing, a consumer cyclic thing; no way, Jos&#233;! Think&#10;Pok&#233;mon. Think World Wide Wrestling. Think Star Wars!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Could we get back to the numbers,&#8221; said Emilio Toad in a voice&#10;that sounded like a cat being liquefied in an industrial-strength&#10;mixer. The gray faces of Harry Hornpecker and Moby Pfister twitched&#10;in relief.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Later, after the deals were signed and the faxes were faxed,&#10;Monique and Stan took a taxi to a cigarillo bar to celebrate.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;What, like, is up with you today?&#8221; said Monique, crouched&#10;somewhat uncomfortably in the taxicab, her knees almost touching&#10;her chin, but exuding her usual sense of style and&#10;unflappability.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Um&#38;#160;&#8230; just IPO jitters?&#8221; said Stan hopefully.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Cut the crap,&#8221; said Monique.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I had a dream about Sheila,&#8221; Stan blurted out.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Oh goddess,&#8221; said Monique. &#8220;Not this again.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;It seemed so real,&#8221; Stan said. &#8220;She said I had to rescue her&#10;from the Ant King.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Well, you&#8217;re not my only weirdo CEO,&#8221; Monique said, giving him&#10;a manly, sidearm hug, &#8220;but I think you&#8217;re the weirdest.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The next morning, nursing a cognac hangover and a throat raw&#10;from cigarillo smoke, Stan stood bewildered in front of a two-story&#10;building in downtown Palo Alto. It looked a lot like where he&#10;worked. There on the signboard were the other companies in his&#10;building: Leng Hong Trading; Trusty &#38;amp; Spark, patent attorneys;&#10;the Bagel Binge, marketing department; MicroChip Times, editorial.&#10;But no gumballs.com, Inc.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I thought you might be here, sir,&#8221; said Pringles, his&#10;secretary, appearing at his elbow.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Huh? Pringles!&#8221; said Stan. The day before, Pringles had been&#10;dressed in a black T-shirt reading &#8220;Your Television Is Already&#10;Dead&#8221; and twelve earrings, but now she was in a smart ochre&#10;business suit, carried a mahogany-colored briefcase, and wore&#10;pearls.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;We&#8217;ve moved, sir,&#8221; she said, leading the way to the&#10;limousine.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;On the highway to Santa Clara, something occurred to Stan.&#10;&#8220;Pringles?&#8221; he said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Yes, sir?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;You didn&#8217;t use to call me sir&#8212;you used to call me Stan.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Yes, sir, but we&#8217;ve gone public now. SEC regulations.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;You&#8217;re kidding,&#8221; said Stan.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Pringles stared out the window.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Gumballs.com Building was thirty stories of mirrored glass&#10;windows with its own exit off Highway 101. A forty-foot cutout of&#10;the corporate animated character, Mr. Gumball, towered over Stan,&#10;exuding yellow hysteria. Pringles escorted Stan to his office suite&#10;on the thirtieth, after giving him a building pass.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Wow,&#8221; said Stan, looking at Pringles across his enormous glass&#10;desktop. &#8220;Nice work, Pringles.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Thank you, sir.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;So what&#8217;s my schedule for today?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Nothing lined up, sir.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Nothing?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Oh. Could I look at the numbers?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I&#8217;ll order them from Accounting, sir.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Can&#8217;t I just ask Bill?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Sir, Bill is the CFO of a public company now. He doesn&#8217;t have&#10;time to look at the numbers.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Oh. Shouldn&#8217;t I have a staff meeting with the department heads&#10;or whatever?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Vic is doing that, sir.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Vic? Who&#8217;s Vic?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Vic is our Executive Vice President for Operations, sir.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;He is?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Stan looked at his desk. There were gold pens, a golden tape&#10;dispenser, a framed picture of Sheila, and a glass jar full of&#10;yellow gumballs. They were the last of the Sheila gumballs.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Pringles?&#8221; Stan said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Yes, sir?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I don&#8217;t have a computer.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;That&#8217;s right, sir.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There was a pause.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Anything else, sir?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Um, yeah. Pringles, what do you suggest I do today?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Pringles turned and walked across the expanse of marble floor to&#10;a teak closet with a brass doorknob. She opened it and returned&#10;with a leather golfing bag, which she leaned against the glass&#10;desk.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Pringles, I don&#8217;t golf,&#8221; said Stan.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;You need to learn, sir,&#8221; said Pringles, and left.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Stan took a gumball from the glass jar and looked at it. He&#10;thought about biting into it, chewing it, blowing a bubble. Or at&#10;least sucking on it. I really should try one of these sometime, he&#10;thought. He looked at Sheila&#8217;s picture. He put the gumball in the&#10;pocket of his Armani suit jacket.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then he went to look for Vampire.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Hi,&#8221; said Stan, looking around a corner of a cubicle on the&#10;seventeenth floor. &#8220;I&#8217;m Stan.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Yeah, whatever,&#8221; said the occupant of the cubicle, not looking&#10;away from her monitor.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;No, really, I&#8217;m Stan, I&#8217;m the CEO here.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Yeah, I believe you, so? What do you want, a medal?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Well, uh,&#8221; Stan said. &#8220;So what are you up to?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I&#8217;m storyboarding the Mr. Gumball Saturday morning cartoon&#10;pilot, and I&#8217;m past deadline, and I&#8217;m paid shit, Mr. CEO.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Oh, okay,&#8221; said Stan. &#8220;I won&#8217;t bug you then.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Great,&#8221; said the cartoon storyboardist.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Hey, by the way, you don&#8217;t know where the sysadmins and stuff&#10;are, though, do you?&#8221; Stan asked.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I thought you weren&#8217;t going to bug me then.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;After many such adventures, Stan found himself in the third&#10;sub-basement of the gumballs.com building, close to despair. It was&#10;8 p.m., and his building pass expired at nine.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Suddenly, faintly, from far off, Stan heard the sound of&#10;horrible, ghostly shrieking and rhythmic pounding.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Thank God, Stan thought, heading toward the sound. And indeed,&#10;as he got closer, he could tell he was listening to one of&#10;Vampire&#8217;s thrash goth trance doom CDs.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Stan had feared that, like Pringles, Vampire might suddenly be&#10;wearing a suit, but as he emerged into Vampire&#8217;s blacklit cavern,&#10;he saw that Vampire was wearing knee-length jet-black hair, a black&#10;trenchcoat, fingerless studded leather gloves, and giant&#10;surgical-steel ear, nose, lip, and tongue piercings, as always.&#10;Perhaps he was surrounded by an even larger array of keyboards,&#10;monitors, and machines than yesterday, but it was hard to tell.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Vampire!&#8221; Stan shouted over the music. &#8220;Am I glad to see&#10;you!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Hey, man,&#8221; said Vampire, lifting a hand in salutation but not&#10;looking away from his monitor.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;So, hey, what are you up to?&#8221; said Stan, looking for somewhere&#10;to sit down. He started to take a broken monitor off a folding&#10;metal chair.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;DON&#8217;T TOUCH THAT!&#8221; Vampire shouted.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Oops, oops, sorry,&#8221; said Stan, backing off.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;No problem,&#8221; said Vampire.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;So, ah, you were saying?&#8221; Stan said hopefully.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Lotta new machines coming in,&#8221; said Vampire. &#8220;What do you know&#10;about NetBSD 2.5 routing across multiple DNS servers?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Absolutely nothing,&#8221; said Stan.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Okay,&#8221; said Vampire, and nodded.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Stan waited a little while, looking around. Finally he spoke&#10;again. &#8220;Ah, Vampire, ever heard of a, the&#8212;this is going to sound&#10;silly but&#8212;the Ant King?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Nope,&#8221; said Vampire. &#8220;I knew an AntAgonist once, on the Inferno&#10;BBS.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Stan. &#8220;But, um, how would you go about finding out&#10;about the Ant King?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;What search engines have you tried?&#8221; asked Vampire.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Well, none,&#8221; said Stan.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Well, try Google, they&#8217;re good.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Okay,&#8221; said Stan. &#8220;Um, Vampire?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Yeah?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I don&#8217;t have a computer anymore.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Vampire turned and looked at Stan. &#8220;You poor bastard!&#8221; he said,&#10;and pointed. &#8220;Use that one.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Ant King was sound asleep on the sofa, cans of Dr. Pepper&#10;littered around him. Sheila got up gingerly, took off her sneakers,&#10;and held them in one hand as she crept for the door, clutching a&#10;Dorito in the other.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was a lucky moment. Sheila passed several of the Ant King&#8217;s&#10;henchmen (who were all bald and stout and wore identical purple&#10;fedoras) asleep at their desks, and threaded her way through the&#10;dark rooms of the Ant King&#8217;s lair to the tunnels at the edge of it.&#10;She stopped at the mouth of the biggest tunnel. Far off, she could&#10;hear running water.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Something moved in the darkness beyond, a great hulking shape.&#10;Sheila moved cautiously forward. With a horrible dry clicking and&#10;rustling, the gigantic Black Roach of Death scuttled forward.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With trembling hands, Sheila fed it the Dorito, as she had seen&#10;the Ant King do, and reached up to pat its enormous antennae. Then&#10;she slid past it into the passageway.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She walked forward, into the darkness. Ten steps; twenty.&#10;Nervously she chewed, and blew a bubble. The bubble popped, echoing&#10;loudly in the tunnel. Sheila froze. But there was no movement from&#10;behind. Carefully she spat the wad of gum into her hand and pressed&#10;it into the wall. Then she moved forward. Thirty steps. I can do&#10;this, she thought. Forty.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Suddenly Sheila was terribly hungry.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I&#8217;ll eat when I get out, she thought grimly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But that didn&#8217;t seem quite right.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She searched her pockets and found another Dorito. She lifted it&#10;to her lips and stopped. No. No, not that. Something was troubling&#10;her. She let the Dorito fall to the ground.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I didn&#8217;t prepare properly for this, she thought. This isn&#8217;t the&#10;way you escape. You need a plan, you need resources. Anyway,&#10;there&#8217;s no rush.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She began creeping back down the tunnel.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It&#8217;s not so bad here anyway, she thought. I&#8217;m all right for now.&#10;I&#8217;ll escape later. This was just a test run. She stroked the&#10;antennae of the Black Roach of Death idly as she passed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Damn Stan anyway, she thought as she crept back through the dark&#10;rooms. Am I supposed to do this all by myself? That guy! Big&#10;talker, but no action.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;On the TV, some CNN talking head was upset about market&#10;valuations. &#8220;Ten billion for &#60;em&#62;g&#60;/em&#62;umballs? This is the perfect&#10;example of market froth! I mean there&#8217;s no business model, there&#10;are no barriers to entry; only in today&#8217;s&#38;#160;&#8230; &#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Sheila switched to MTV and sank into the couch next to the Ant&#10;King.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Hi,&#8221; said the Ant King drowsily.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Hi,&#8221; said Sheila.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Hey, I missed you,&#8221; said the Ant King.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Stick it in your ear,&#8221; said Sheila.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Listen, your ambivalence about me is really getting old,&#10;Sheila,&#8221; said the Ant King.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Ambivalence about you? Dream on,&#8221; said Sheila. She took a&#10;yellow gumball from the dish on the coffee table, popped it in her&#10;mouth, and bit down. A crunch, a rush of sweetness, the feeling of&#10;her teeth sinking into the gumball&#8217;s tough flesh. Sheila smiled and&#10;blew a bubble. It popped. She wasn&#8217;t hungry anymore. &#8220;I hate your&#10;guts,&#8221; she said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Yeah, whatever,&#8221; said the Ant King, rolling over and pulling a&#10;pillow over his head. &#8220;Grow up, Sheila.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The search on Google.com had returned several bands and music&#10;CDs, an episode of the Kin&#60;em&#62;g&#60;/em&#62; of t&#60;em&#62;h&#60;/em&#62;e Hill cartoon,&#10;the &#8220;Lair of the Ant King&#8221; slide at the local water park, and&#10;several video games in which the Ant King was one of the villains&#10;to beat. Stan listened to the CDs in his car, watched the cartoon&#10;in a conference room with a video projector, and installed the&#10;video games on a receptionist&#8217;s computer on the fifth floor and&#10;played them at night, hiding from the security guards. He popped&#10;down to visit Vampire a lot, and avoided Pringles and his office&#10;entirely.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I&#8217;m on level 5,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and I just can&#8217;t get past the&#10;Roach.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;And you&#8217;ve still got the magic sword?&#8221; said Vampire, not&#10;looking up.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;No, I lost that to the Troll.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;You don&#8217;t even have to go to the Troll,&#8221; said Vampire, who&#10;never played video games but read the video game newsgroups&#10;religiously. &#8220;You can cross the Dread Bridge instead.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I always die on the Dread Bridge when it breaks in two.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;You&#8217;re not running fast enough,&#8221; said Vampire. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got to&#10;run as fast as you can, and jump at the last moment.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;It&#8217;s tough,&#8221; said Stan.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Vampire shrugged.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;How are things with you?&#8221; Stan asked.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;The patch for mod-ssl 1.2.4.2 is totally incompatible with the&#10;recommended build sequence for Apache on Solaris. Solaris is such&#10;crap.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Stan. &#8220;Okay.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Hey, I got you something,&#8221; Vampire said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;What?&#8221; said Stan.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;That,&#8221; said Vampire, pointing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;On top of a rack of dusty computers Stan saw a four-foot-long&#10;sword in a gilded leather sheath. Its ivory handle depicted a&#10;spiral of crawling ants. Stan pulled the sword a little out of its&#10;sheath, and an eerie blue light filled the room.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Cool, huh?&#8221; said Vampire. &#8220;I got it on eBay.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Holding his magic sword, Stan left the elevator on the thirtieth&#10;floor and cautiously approached his office. He hadn&#8217;t been there in&#10;a week; he felt like he should check in.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Pringles met him at the door. &#8220;This isn&#8217;t your office anymore,&#10;sir,&#8221; she said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;It&#8217;s not?&#8221; Stan said. He tried to hold the sword at an&#10;inconspicuous angle. Pringles ignored it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;No, sir. We moved Vic in there.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Oh, really? Say, when do I get to meet Vic, anyway?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure, sir. He&#8217;s quite busy these days, with our&#10;acquisition of Suriname.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;We&#8217;re acquiring Suriname? Isn&#8217;t that a country?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Yes, sir. Follow me, please.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Um, Pringles,&#8221; said Stan, hurrying to catch up. &#8220;Am I, ah,&#10;still CEO?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Pringles opened the door of his new office. It was a lot&#10;smaller.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I&#8217;ll check with HR, sir,&#8221; she said, and left.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;That afternoon, as Stan sat at his new, smaller desk, Monique&#10;stopped by.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Hey, hey,&#8221; she said, &#8220;so here&#8217;s where they&#8217;ve got you,&#10;huh?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Monique, what&#8217;s going on? Have I been, um, usurped?&#8221; It seemed&#10;like the wrong word.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Oh, I wouldn&#8217;t worry about it, tiger,&#8221; she said, sinking into a&#10;leather visitor&#8217;s chair, and crossing her legs. &#8220;Gumballs is doing&#10;great. Vic&#8217;s doing a good job, you should be proud.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;But Monique&#8212;I don&#8217;t do anything anymore.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Oh, stop whining,&#8221; Monique said. She rolled her eyes. &#8220;God, you&#10;make such a big deal out of everything. Cool sword.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; said Stan glumly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Look, you&#8217;re a startup-stage guy, not an operations-stage guy.&#10;Just enjoy the ride.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I guess,&#8221; said Stan.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;There you go. Listen, you clearly need cheering up. I&#8217;m&#10;babysitting my sister&#8217;s kid on the weekend, we&#8217;re going to the&#10;water park. You wanna come?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Sure,&#8221; said Stan. &#8220;Why not?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Monique came by Stan&#8217;s apartment Saturday morning, and Stan came&#10;outside, dressed in a blue oxford and chinos and carrying a bathing&#10;suit and towel, and his magic sword. Monique was wearing a silver&#10;blouse, a blue miniskirt, a silk scarf, and sunglasses. Her&#10;sister&#8217;s kid had a shaved head, powdered white skin, black&#10;lipstick, and kohl, and was wearing combat boots and a wedding&#10;dress adorned with black spiders.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Stan, this is Corpse, my sister&#8217;s kid,&#8221; Monique said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Hi,&#8221; said Stan.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Corpse snarled, like a wolf.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Great, everybody ready?&#8221; said Monique.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In the car, Stan said, &#8220;So, Corpse, what&#8217;s your favorite subject&#10;in school?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Shop,&#8221; said Corpse.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Aha,&#8221; said Stan. &#8220;And what do you want to do when you grow&#10;up?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Bring about the violent overthrow of the current political&#10;order,&#8221; said Corpse.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Really? How come?&#8221; asked Stan.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Corpse&#8217;s eyes rolled back into their sockets, exposing the&#10;white.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Takes after me, don&#8217;t you, Corpse?&#8221; said Monique happily.&#10;Corpse said nothing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;But, Monique,&#8221; said Stan. &#8220;You&#8217;re a venture capitalist. You are&#10;the current political order.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Monique laughed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Corpse,&#8221; said Stan, &#8220;I hope you don&#8217;t mind me asking this, but&#10;ah, are you a boy or a girl?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;You teleological totalitarian!&#8221; Corpse shouted. &#8220;Your kind will&#10;be first up against the wall when the revolution comes!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Now, Corpse, be nice,&#8221; said Monique. But she was grinning.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Stan stood in line for the water slide in his bathing suit,&#10;behind Corpse, who was still wearing the wedding dress. He had left&#10;his sword in the locker room. He felt naked without it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Corpse sat in the mouth of the water slide tunnel, waiting for&#10;the &#8220;Go&#8221; light to turn green. Stan looked over at the slide to his&#10;left. It was a boat ride; in a puffy inflatable boat, four stout,&#10;bald men in business suits and purple fedoras sat waiting for the&#10;green light. Behind them was a Mexican family in bathing suits,&#10;waiting with their boat.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;That&#8217;s funny, Stan thought. He looked closer at the fedoraed&#10;men.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In their boat was a glass jar filled with perhaps three hundred&#10;yellow gumballs.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The lights turned green; Corpse vanished into the slide and the&#10;men in the boat slid into their tunnel. Despite the sign reading&#10;One At A Time, Wait For The Green Light, Stan jumped in after&#10;Corpse.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Halfway through the twists, turns, and splashing chaos of the&#10;tunnel, Stan collided with Corpse. &#8220;Hey!&#8221; Corpse yelled, and was&#10;sucked away again.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Stan was dumped out into a great basin. He went under and came&#10;up spluttering, chlorine stinging his nose. Standing unsteadily, he&#10;looked over at the end of the boat ride. There was no sign of the&#10;men with the fedoras: The water there flowed peacefully.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Hey!&#8221; said Corpse, splashing him. &#8220;You&#8217;re not supposed to go&#10;two at once!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I thought you wanted to overthrow the current political order,&#8221;&#10;said Stan, still watching the boat ride.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Oh, right, so let&#8217;s start with the water park,&#8221; Corpse&#10;said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;Why not?&#8221; said Stan. The Mexican family, in their boat,&#10;emerged from the boat ride. There was no question: The other boat&#10;had vanished while in the tunnel.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Monique was standing next to the basin in her polka-dot bikini,&#10;yelling into her pink waterproof cell phone. &#8220;No, you idiot, I&#10;don&#8217;t want you profitable! Because we can&#8217;t find backers for a&#10;profitable company, that&#8217;s why! Well find something to spend it&#10;on!&#8221; She clicked off the cell phone and shook her head. &#8220;Some&#10;people are so stuck in the Old Economy.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Can I borrow that?&#8221; Stan asked.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Okay,&#8221; Monique said, handing him the phone. &#8220;Don&#8217;t lose&#10;it.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Meet me at the boat ride in five minutes,&#8221; Stan said, and,&#10;dialing Vampire, hurried off to get his sword.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The light turned green, and the boat containing Monique, Corpse,&#10;and Stan, holding his magic sword, slid into the tunnel.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Did you get in?&#8221; shouted Stan into the pink cell phone over the&#10;roar of rushing water. The boat surged through the great pipe, spun&#10;into a whirlpool, then rushed on.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; said Vampire, over the cell phone. &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t easy, but&#10;I&#8217;m in. Actually, after I cracked the session key it wasn&#8217;t that&#10;bad, they&#8217;ve got a continuous telnet session going over a Pac Bell&#10;router, so&#38;#160;&#8230; &#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The boat lurched and heaved to the right and a cascade of water&#10;flew over them. Stan shouted, &#8220;So, did you, you know, open the&#10;secret door or whatever?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Oh, right,&#8221; said Vampire, and typed a command to the water&#10;park&#8217;s main computer, setting the &#8220;Lair of the Ant King&#8221; ride into&#10;&#8220;real&#8221; mode.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The rubber boat rushed into a curve. In front of them, a section&#10;of wall swung away and the boat flew out of the pipe, into darkness&#10;and space, falling between black canyon walls.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;This ride is cool!&#8221; said Corpse, as they fell.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When the boat hit the great subterranean river below, it bucked,&#10;and Monique and Corpse grabbed onto the handles set into its sides.&#10;Stan thought about whether to drop the pink cell phone or the magic&#10;sword, and while he thought about it, he flew out of the boat and&#10;disappeared into the icy rapids.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Stan!&#8221; Monique yelled.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Bummer,&#8221; said Corpse.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The surging river slowed as it widened, they glided past massive&#10;black cliffs, and at last the rubber boat coasted up to a dock,&#10;where several stout men in purple fedoras helped Monique and Corpse&#10;onto dry land.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Ant King bowed, and his antennae bobbed. &#8220;Well, this is an&#10;unexpected pleasure,&#8221; he said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Cool lair,&#8221; said Corpse.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Why thank you,&#8221; said the Ant King. &#8220;You both look soaked. We&#10;have robes and changing rooms right over here. Care for an&#10;espresso?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Sure,&#8221; said Monique.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Got hot chocolate?&#8221; said Corpse.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Why yes we do,&#8221; said the Ant King.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Okay, there&#8217;s a little yellow bird here,&#8221; Stan said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;You still got the rod?&#8221; said Vampire over the pink cell&#10;phone.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Stan looked down at the crook of his arm, where he was&#10;uncomfortably carrying a rod, an axe, a loaf of bread, and a key.&#10;He was still in his bathing suit, dripping wet, and exhausted from&#10;wandering the tunnels for hours. The blue glow of his magic sword&#10;dimly illuminated the room, including a small yellow bird, which&#10;watched him suspiciously.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Put the rod down,&#8221; said Vampire. Stan let it slide out and&#10;clatter to the ground.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Now catch the bird,&#8221; Vampire said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With the pink cell phone wedged between his ear and his&#10;shoulder, and his collection of found objects in the crook of his&#10;sword arm, Stan edged toward the bird. It looked at him dubiously,&#10;and hopped away.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I can&#8217;t seem to get ahold of it,&#8221; Stan said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;All right, forget the bird. It&#8217;s only extra points anyway.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Extra points!&#8221; shouted Stan. &#8220;I&#8217;m not trying to get extra&#10;points, I&#8217;m trying to get Sheila!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Okay, Okay, keep your hat on,&#8221; said Vampire. &#8220;Get the rod again&#10;and go north.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;While Stan wandered a maze of twisty little passages, leaving&#10;found objects and pieces of bread according to Vampire&#8217;s&#10;instructions, in order to differentiate the rooms from one another&#10;and thus navigate the maze, and Corpse and Monique changed into&#10;fuzzy purple terry-cloth bathrobes, and Sheila watched Comedy&#10;Central and felt inexplicably restless, the Ant King logged onto a&#10;network and sent a message, which appeared in the corner of&#10;Vampire&#8217;s screen.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;T&#60;em&#62;h&#60;/em&#62;ink you&#8217;re pretty smart, &#60;em&#62;h&#60;/em&#62;u&#60;em&#62;h&#60;/em&#62;? it&#10;said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Okay,&#8221; said Stan, &#8220;uh, I&#8217;m in the room with the axe again.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Hold on,&#8221; said Vampire. &#8220;Message.&#8221; He did some tracking to find&#10;out where the message had come from, but no luck: he found a&#10;circular trail of impossible addresses.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I know I&#8217;m pretty smart, he typed back at it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Not as smart as you t&#60;em&#62;h&#60;/em&#62;ink, the Ant King typed back at&#10;him. You t&#60;em&#62;h&#60;/em&#62;ink I would leave sendmail runnin&#60;em&#62;g&#60;/em&#62; on&#10;an open port on my real proxy server? As if I didn&#8217;t know about&#10;t&#60;em&#62;h&#60;/em&#62;e security &#60;em&#62;h&#60;/em&#62;ole in t&#60;em&#62;h&#60;/em&#62;at baby.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Okay, I think I see the way out here,&#8221; said Stan. &#8220;This is the&#10;room with the two pieces of bread&#8212;have I gone east from here?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Hold on a sec,&#8221; muttered Vampire.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I have,&#8221; said Stan.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Okay, I&#8217;m stumped, typed Vampire. If t&#60;em&#62;h&#60;/em&#62;at&#8217;s not your&#10;real proxy server, w&#60;em&#62;h&#60;/em&#62;at is it?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It&#8217;s my PalmPilot, the Ant King typed back. Wit&#60;em&#62;h&#60;/em&#62; a few&#10;tweaks to t&#60;em&#62;h&#60;/em&#62;e OS. And you&#8217;re&#10;&#60;em&#62;h&#60;/em&#62;o&#60;em&#62;gg&#60;/em&#62;in&#60;em&#62;g&#60;/em&#62; a lot of memory on it, so I&#8217;d&#10;appreciate it if you lo&#60;em&#62;gg&#60;/em&#62;ed off, Vampy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Hey, &#60;em&#62;h&#60;/em&#62;old on, Vampire typed. Is t&#60;em&#62;h&#60;/em&#62;is&#10;AntA&#60;em&#62;g&#60;/em&#62;onist?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Used to be. Not anymore, typed the Ant King.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m out!&#8221; Stan said. &#8220;It&#8217;s opening up into a large cavern.&#10;Wow, this is great, Vampire!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;No s&#60;em&#62;h&#60;/em&#62;it! typed Vampire. How &#60;em&#62;h&#60;/em&#62;ave you been,&#10;man?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I&#8217;ve been &#60;em&#62;g&#60;/em&#62;reat, but I can&#8217;t say t&#60;em&#62;h&#60;/em&#62;e same for&#10;you, typed the Ant King. You are rusty as &#60;em&#62;h&#60;/em&#62;ell.&#10;W&#60;em&#62;h&#60;/em&#62;at are you doin&#60;em&#62;g&#60;/em&#62; sellin&#60;em&#62;g g&#60;/em&#62;umballs for&#10;a livin&#60;em&#62;g&#60;/em&#62; anyway?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Oh, shit,&#8221; said Stan. &#8220;Oh, shit!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;What?&#8221; said Vampire curtly, typing furiously in the chat&#10;window.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Vampire, it&#8217;s the bridge. It&#8217;s the Dread Bridge! I always die&#10;at the Dread Bridge.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I told you, man,&#8221; Vampire said absently, as he chatted with the&#10;Ant King. &#8220;You&#8217;ve just gotta run fast enough.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Cell phone in one hand, sword in the other, Stan began to run.&#10;His bare feet slapped against the planks of the Dread Bridge; the&#10;bridge swung crazily over the chasm, and he fought for balance. As&#10;he neared the middle he threw the sword ahead of him, and it&#10;clattered onto the ground beyond the bridge. He stuffed the cell&#10;phone into the waistband of his bathing suit, and ran on. Suddenly&#10;he heard a snap behind him, and he jumped. The bridge broke beneath&#10;his weight, and swung away. Stan flew through the air, but not&#10;nearly far enough; he fell, and barely managed to grab the planks&#10;of the bridge beneath him. He hung on as the ropes strained; he&#10;thought they were going to break, and he screamed in terror. But&#10;the ropes held. Stan swung over the dark canyon, clutching the&#10;planks.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Hey, are you okay?&#8221; Vampire said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; Stan panted. &#8220;Yeah, I think so.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Great,&#8221; Vampire said. &#8220;Listen, I know this is kind of a bad&#10;time, but there&#8217;s something we need to talk about.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Huh?&#8221; said Stan. &#8220;What?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Well, this is kind of awkward for me, but, you know, I haven&#8217;t&#10;really been feeling fulfilled professionally here lately&#38;#160;&#8230;&#10;&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;What?&#8221; said Stan.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;So, well, I&#8217;ve decided to accept another offer of employment,&#10;basically.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;You&#8217;re kidding,&#8221; said Stan. &#8220;From whom?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;From the Ant King, actually. I&#8217;m pretty excited about it; it&#8217;s&#10;a whole different level of responsibility, and&#8212;&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;The Ant King?!&#8221; yelled Stan. &#8220;The Ant King?!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Yeah, actually it turns out I know him from way back and&#8212;&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;But, Vampire!&#8221; yelled Stan. &#8220;Listen, aren&#8217;t we in this&#10;together?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Hey, Stan,&#8221; Vampire said. &#8220;Let&#8217;s not make this hard on&#10;ourselves, okay? This is just the career move I think is right for&#10;me right now&#38;#160;&#8230; &#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Vampire, we can give you more responsibility!&#8221; Stan could feel&#10;the cool air of the endless chasm blowing against his feet. &#8220;More&#10;stock! Whatever you want!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;That&#8217;s great of you to offer, Stan, really,&#8221; said Vampire.&#10;&#8220;But, you know, it&#8217;s getting really corporate here, and that&#8217;s just&#10;not my scene. I think I&#8217;ll be happier in a more entrepreneurial&#10;climate.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;But, Vampire!&#8221; Stan shouted, and just then the ropes above him&#10;groaned and one snapped, and the planks he was holding onto twisted&#10;and spun. Stan was slammed against the wall, and the pink cell&#10;phone popped out of his waistband and fell into the darkness. He&#10;waited, but he never heard it reach the ground.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Crap, he thought, and began to climb the planks, toward the&#10;ledge above.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Yes!&#8221; said the Ant King. &#8220;Exactly! Wile E. Coyote is the only&#10;figure of any integrity in twentieth-century literature.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Totally,&#8221; said Corpse.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Come on,&#8221; said Monique. &#8220;What about Bugs Bunny?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;An amateur!&#8221; said the Ant King. &#8220;A dilettante! No purity of&#10;intention!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Pinky and the Brain?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Losers! Try to take over the world indeed!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Sheila cleared her throat. &#8220;Um, does anyone want some more&#10;pretzels?&#8221; she asked.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Are you the one we&#8217;re here to rescue?&#8221; Corpse asked. Sheila&#10;blanched.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Yeah, she&#8217;s the one,&#8221; said the Ant King. &#8220;So listen&#8212;Star Trek&#10;or Star Wars?&#38;#160;&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Oh, please,&#8221; said Corpse. &#8220;Babylon 5!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Excellent choice!&#8221; said the Ant King.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I like Star Wars. Particularly Darth Vader,&#8221; said Monique.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I&#8217;ll just go for some more pretzels then,&#8221; Sheila said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;But then he bails on the Dark Side in the end!&#8221; the Ant King&#10;said. &#8220;See? No integrity!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Cold and angry, clutching his magic sword in both hands, Stan&#10;stood before the gigantic Black Roach of Death.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Come on, big boy,&#8221; he yelled. &#8220;Make my day! Meet my sword,&#10;Roach Motel! You&#8217;re gonna check in, but you&#8217;re not gonna&#10;check&#8212;&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With a lazy swipe of its great claws, the roach batted the magic&#10;sword out of Stan&#8217;s hands. It flew away and clattered into the&#10;darkness. Then the roach grabbed Stan around the throat and lifted&#10;him high into the air.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Eek!&#8221; Stan screamed in terror.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;He&#8217;s a friend of mine,&#8221; yelled Sheila, sprinting out of the&#10;darkness.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Sheila!&#8221; choked Stan.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Here, c&#8217;mon, boy, put him down, here&#8217;s a Dorito,&#8221; Sheila&#10;said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Reluctantly the roach dropped Stan, ate a Dorito, allowed itself&#10;to be petted, and crawled back into the tunnel.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; croaked Stan, as Sheila helped him up.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Hand in hand, Sheila and Stan made their way through the tunnels&#10;leading away from the Ant King&#8217;s lair.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Don&#8217;t look back,&#8221; Stan kept saying. &#8220;Okay? Don&#8217;t look&#10;back.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Okay already,&#8221; Sheila said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Suddenly Sheila stopped.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;What?&#8221; said Stan, careful not to look back at her.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I&#8217;m, um, I&#8217;m hungry,&#8221; said Sheila.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Me, too,&#8221; said Stan. &#8220;Let&#8217;s go.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;But listen, we could just sneak back and grab a bite to eat,&#10;right? I mean, I ran out here because I heard you were finally&#10;coming, but I would&#8217;ve packed a sandwich if I&#8217;d&#8212;&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Sheila, are you nuts?&#8221; said Stan.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;What&#8217;s that supposed to mean?&#8221; said Sheila.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Stan felt in his pockets. The left one was empty. The right one&#10;had something in it&#8212;a gumball. Dry. He pulled it out and squinted&#10;at it in the dimness. He remembered putting a gumball into the&#10;pocket of his suit jacket, but&#38;#160;&#8230;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Okay, so I&#8217;m going back,&#8221; Sheila said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Quick, chew this,&#8221; Stan said, handing the gumball back to her&#10;without looking back.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She chewed the gumball, and they walked onward through the&#10;tunnel.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I never thought I&#8217;d say this,&#8221; said the Ant King, stirring his&#10;espresso nervously. &#8220;Sheila will be angry, but&#8212;well, how can I put&#10;this&#8212;&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Spit it out already,&#8221; Monique said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; Corpse said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Corpse, I just&#8212;I feel like you really get me, you know?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; Corpse said softly. &#8220;I feel the same way.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Monique whistled.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Would you&#38;#160;&#8230; &#8221; The Ant King blushed. &#8220;Would you like to&#10;stay underground with me forever and help me rule the subterranean&#10;depths?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Wow, that would be totally awesome!&#8221; Corpse said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Oh god, your mother&#8217;s going to kill me,&#8221; Monique said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Oh come on, Aunt Monique, don&#8217;t turn into a hypocrite on me!&#10;You always told me to follow my heart! You always say it&#8217;s better&#10;to get into trouble than to be bored!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say you can&#8217;t do it,&#8221; said Monique. &#8220;I just said your&#10;mother&#8217;s going to kill me.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;So does that mean I can?&#8221; asked Corpse.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;How about if we do this on a trial basis at first,&#8221; Monique&#10;said. &#8220;Okay? And you&#8212;&#8221; she pointed a menacing finger at the Ant&#10;King. &#8220;No addictive gumball crap, okay?&#8221; His antennae stiffened in&#10;surprise. &#8220;Yeah, Aunt Monique knows more than you think. You watch&#10;your step, buddy.&#8221; She turned to Corpse. &#8220;You have one month,&#8221; she&#10;said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll talk to your mom. Then you come back up and we talk it&#10;over.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Oh gosh, thank you, Aunt Monique!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;You have my word,&#8221; said the Ant King. &#8220;Corpse will enjoy life&#10;here thoroughly. And it will be very educational.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I bet,&#8221; said Monique.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Hey, can we violently overthrow the current political order?&#8221;&#10;Corpse asked.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Sure,&#8221; said the Ant King. &#8220;That sounds like fun.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&#62;Epilogue&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Stan sat across the desk from Lucy the HR person, who smiled at&#10;him brightly. &#8220;So what are your skills?&#8221; she asked.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I founded this company,&#8221; he said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;We try to be forward-looking here,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Less progressive&#10;organizations are focussed on past accomplishments, but our&#10;philosophy is to focus on current skills. What languages can you&#10;program in?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;None,&#8221; said Stan. &#8220;I can use Microsoft Word, though.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Mmm-&#60;em&#62;h&#60;/em&#62;mm,&#8221; Lucy said. &#8220;Anything else?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I&#8217;m pretty good at financial analysis,&#8221; Stan said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;We are actually overstaffed in Accounting,&#8221; Lucy said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I could work in Marketing,&#8221; Stan said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Lucy smiled indulgently. &#8220;Everyone thinks they know how to do&#10;Marketing. What about Customer Service?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll pass,&#8221; said Stan.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Okay,&#8221; Lucy said brightly. &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll let you know as soon as&#10;something else opens up. Gumballs.com cares about you as an&#10;employee. We want you to know that, and we want you to enjoy your&#10;indefinite unpaid leave. Can you do that for me, Stan?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I&#8217;ll try,&#8221; said Stan, and he left.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Stan finally met Vic at the company Christmas party in San&#10;Francisco. As he expected, Vic was tall, blond, and athletic, with&#10;a tennis smile.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Stan!&#8221; Vic said brightly. &#8220;Good to finally meet you. And this&#10;must be Sheila.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Hi!&#8221; said Sheila, shaking hands.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Hi, Vic,&#8221; said Stan. &#8220;Listen, I&#38;#160;&#8230; &#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Great dress,&#8221; Vic said to Sheila.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Thanks!&#8221; Sheila said. &#8220;So what&#8217;s running the show like?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Stan said, &#8220;I wanted to&#38;#160;&#8230; &#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;It&#8217;s actually quieted down a bunch,&#8221; Vic said. &#8220;I&#8217;m starting to&#10;have time for a little golf and skiing.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Stan said, &#8220;I was wondering if we could&#38;#160;&#8230; &#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Wow!&#8221; said Sheila. &#8220;Where do you ski?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Tahoe,&#8221; said Vic.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Of course,&#8221; laughed Sheila.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Stan said, &#8220;Maybe if we could take a few minutes&#38;#160;&#8230; &#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;So is your wife here?&#8221; Sheila asked.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Vic laughed. &#8220;No, I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;m single.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Wow, are you gay?&#8221; Sheila asked.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;About 80&#8211;20 straight,&#8221; Vic said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Hey, me, too!&#8221; Sheila said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Stan said, &#8220;It&#8217;s about my job here at&#38;#160;&#8230; &#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;But really, I just haven&#8217;t found anyone I&#8217;ve clicked with since&#10;moving to the Bay Area,&#8221; Vic said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I know what you mean!&#8221; Sheila said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Stan said, &#8220;Because I have some ideas about how I could&#38;#160;&#8230;&#10;&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;So where were you before the Bay Area?&#8221; Sheila asked.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Later Sheila came up to Stan at the punch bowl.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Stan, you know, things haven&#8217;t been going so great for us&#10;lately.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Uh huh,&#8221; Stan said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I want you to know, I really appreciate you rescuing me&#38;#160;&#8230;&#10;&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Hey, no problem,&#8221; Stan said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;But since then, it just seems like we aren&#8217;t going anywhere,&#10;you know?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Sheila, I love you,&#8221; said Stan. &#8220;I&#8217;d give my life for you. I&#8217;ve&#10;never found anything in my life that means anything to me, except&#10;you.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I know, Stan,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I know. And maybe I&#8217;m being a bitch,&#10;but you know, that&#8217;s kind of hard to live up to. You know? And I&#8217;m&#10;just not there yet.&#8221; She put her arms around him. He stiffened. She&#10;let go and sighed. &#8220;I just think&#38;#160;&#8230; &#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Are you going to run off with Vic?&#8221; Stan said. &#8220;Just give it to&#10;me straight.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Sheila sighed. &#8220;Yeah,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Yeah, I guess I am. I&#8217;m&#10;sorry.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Me, too,&#8221; Stan said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Stan left the party and walked to the Bay Bridge. He looked down&#10;into the black water. He thought about jumping, but he didn&#8217;t&#10;really feel like dying. He just didn&#8217;t feel like being him&#10;anymore.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He decided to become a bum and walked to South of Market, where&#10;he traded his suit, shoes, and wallet for an army jacket, a woolen&#10;cap, torn jeans, sneakers, a shopping cart, three plastic sacks,&#10;and a bottle of Night Train in a paper bag. But he wasn&#8217;t a good&#10;bum. He was too polite to panhandle, he didn&#8217;t like the taste of&#10;Night Train, and at campfires he felt alienated from the other&#10;bums&#8212;he didn&#8217;t know any of the songs they liked, and they didn&#8217;t&#10;want to talk about Internet stocks. He was hungry, cold, lonely,&#10;tired, and sober when Monique found him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;You look like shit,&#8221; she said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Go away, Monique,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m a bum now.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Oh, yeah?&#8221; said Monique. &#8220;And how&#8217;s that working out?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Lousy,&#8221; Stan admitted.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Monique got out of her BMW and squatted down next to where Stan&#10;lay. The other bums moved away, rolling their eyes and shaking&#10;their heads in disgust.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I&#8217;ve lost everything I love,&#8221; Stan said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you the guy who loved the dramatic surge and crash of&#10;Amazon&#8217;s stock ticker? The concrete malls spreading across America&#10;like blood staining a handkerchief? How everything can be tracked&#10;and mirrored in numbers&#8212;numbers, the lifeblood of capitalism?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Well, yeah,&#8221; Stan said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Get in the car,&#8221; Monique said. &#8220;You&#8217;re hired.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Stan got in the car.&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 2872, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/2872', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('The Valley of Giants'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;I had buried my parents in their gray marble mausoleum at the&#10;heart of the city. I had buried my husband in a lead box sunk into&#10;the mud of the bottom of the river, where all the riverboatmen lie.&#10;And after the war, I had buried my children, all four, in white&#10;linen shrouds in the new graveyards plowed into what used to be our&#10;farmland: all the land stretching from the river delta to the&#10;hills.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I had one granddaughter who survived the war. I saw her&#10;sometimes: in a bright pink dress, a sparkling drink in her hand,&#10;on the arm of some foreign officer with brocade on his shoulders,&#10;at the edge of a marble patio. She never looked back at me&#8212;poverty&#10;and failure and political disrepute being all, these days,&#10;contagious and synonymous.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The young were mostly dead, and the old men had been taken away,&#10;they told us, to learn important new things and to come back when&#10;they were ready to contribute fully. So it was a city of&#10;grandmothers. And it was in a grandmother bar by the&#10;waterfront&#8212;sipping hot tea with rum and watching over the shoulders&#10;of dockworkers playing mah-jongg&#8212;that I first heard of the valley&#10;of giants.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;We all laughed at the idea, except for a chemist with a crooked&#10;nose and rouge caked in the creases of her face, who was incensed.&#10;&#8220;We live in the modern era!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;You should be ashamed of&#10;yourself!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The traveler stood up from the table. She was bony and&#10;rough-skinned and bent like an old crow, with a blue silk scarf and&#10;hanks of hair as black as soot. Her eyes were veined with red.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Nonetheless,&#8221; the traveler said, and she walked out.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;They were laughing at the chemist as well as at the traveler. To&#10;find anyone still proud, anyone who believed in giants or shame,&#10;was hilarious. The air of the bar was acrid with triumph. Finding&#10;someone even more vulnerable and foolish than we were, after&#10;everything had been taken from us&#8212;that was a delight.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But I followed the traveler, into the wet streets. The smell of&#10;fish oozed from the docks. Here and there were bits of charred&#10;debris in the gutters. I caught her at her door.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She invited me in for tea and massage. Her limbs were weathered&#10;and ringed, like the branches of trees in the dry country. She&#10;smelled like honey that has been kept a while in a dark room, a&#10;little fermented. A heady smell.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In the morning, brilliant sunlight scoured the walls and the&#10;floor, and the traveler and her pack were gone.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I hurried home. My house had survived the war with all its brown&#10;clay walls intact, though the garden and the courtyard were a heap&#10;of blackened rubble. My house was empty and cold.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I packed six loaves of flatbread, some olives, a hard cheese,&#10;one nice dress, walking clothes, my pills and glasses, a jug of&#10;wine, a canteen of water, and a kitchen knife. I sat in the shadow&#10;in my living room for a while, looking at the amorphous mass of the&#10;blanket I had been crocheting.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;That granddaughter: her parents both worked in the vineyards,&#10;and when she was a child, she would play in my courtyard in the&#10;afternoons. When she scraped her knees bloody on the stones, she&#10;refused to cry. She would cry from frustration when the older&#10;children could do something that she couldn&#8217;t&#8212;like tie knots, or&#10;catch a chicken. Sitting on my lap, her small body shaking, her&#10;small fists striking my back slowly, one and then the other. In the&#10;evening she would perch on my courtyard wall, looking toward the&#10;vineyards, her eyes burning like candles, searching for the first&#10;glimpse of her parents coming home.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I decided not to take the knife. I did not know if I would have&#10;trouble at the checkpoints, but sane grandmothers rely on moral&#10;authority rather than force: a bitter, weak, futile weapon, but the&#10;one we can manage best. I replaced the knife with a harmonica.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Because the traveler had had fresh grapes in a bowl in her room,&#10;I started out toward the vineyards. Because there had been red ash&#10;caked in the soles of her boots, I passed through the vineyards&#10;into the somber dust of the dry country. And because a valley of&#10;giants would have to be well hidden, I left the dry country at the&#10;foothills of the snowy mountains.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I knew I was right at the checkpoint, because the soldiers who&#10;waved me through were pawing through the traveler&#8217;s sack, arguing&#10;over her silk scarves.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In the wild country of the foothills, I saw the smoke from her&#10;campfire, a loose thread of pure white in a sky the color of old&#10;linen.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Her eyes were redder than before. Her clothes were muddy, and I&#10;knew she had been thrown to the ground by the soldiers. Defending&#10;her scarves.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She tore the pack from my hands and opened it like someone&#10;ripping a bandage from a scab. She threw my things to the ground:&#10;my flatbread, my walking clothes, my canteen, my cheese. I watched&#10;her, my hands aching. When she found the harmonica, though, she&#10;began to laugh. Gently I took the pack from her hands, and I spread&#10;our things on a flat rock, while she stood and laughed with her&#10;eyes closed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Her pallet was soft, and the skin of her back was warm.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She would not tell me what the giants were like. I wondered if&#10;they were beasts, or an army, or sages. I thought they might be&#10;dangerous&#8212;that they might tear apart my old body, eat me up with&#10;their sharp teeth. Instead of a mausoleum, an iron box, a white&#10;shroud, my grave would be a giant&#8217;s intestines. That way my body&#10;would be useful. That way, maybe, I would find release, instead of&#10;this enduring.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When we came to the pass that led to their valley, it was bitter&#10;cold. I wished I&#8217;d brought warmer things. The valley was twisting,&#10;vast, and wooded. The traveler took my hand to lead me down the&#10;trail. &#8220;Soon,&#8221; she said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The first giant smiled when he saw us. He had a big, round belly&#10;and soft eyes too large for his face, and full lips, and shaggy&#10;brown hair like yarn. He was naked, and his stubby penis wobbled as&#10;he walked. It was the size of a kitchen stool.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There was a small dark woman sitting on his shoulders, holding&#10;on to his yarnlike hair. She was only forty-five or fifty years&#10;old, and she wore the ragged remains of a doctor&#8217;s uniform: white&#10;lab coat, black pants, flats. She peeked at us, and then hid her&#10;face in her giant&#8217;s hair.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The traveler let go of my hand and ran into the valley, calling&#10;out. A lean, red-haired giant woman with heavy breasts came out of&#10;a cave and picked her up.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I followed, watching the traveler. The giant tossed her into the&#10;air, higher than a steeple or a minaret. And caught her again.&#10;Tossed her, and caught her again. My stomach was cold with terror.&#10;If she fell from there, she would shatter. She was screaming with&#10;laughter. The giant was grinning. They did not look down at me.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I wandered into the valley. The giants looked at me curiously,&#10;ate the fruits of the trees, slept by the river. At last I stood by&#10;a giant who was sitting against a tree, looking shyly at his hands.&#10;His skin was the color of teak. His hair was black and curly. He&#10;picked me up and sat me in his lap.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The thing about the giants, is this. The reason no one wants to&#10;leave, is this. They hold you. You only need to cry or call, and&#10;strong hands as big as kitchen tables pick you up and cradle you.&#10;The giants whisper and hum, placing their great soft lips against&#10;your belly, your back. They stroke your hair, and their fingers, as&#10;big as plates, are so delicate. You fall asleep held in the crook&#10;of their arms, or on their shoulders, clinging to their hair. The&#10;giant women feed you from their breasts&#8212;great sagging breasts as&#10;large as horses, with nipples as large as pitchers. The milk is&#10;sweet and rich like cr&#232;me br&#251;l&#233;e.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When they hold you to their chests and hum, your curl your old&#10;and scarred and aching body against that great expanse of flesh and&#10;breathe, just breathe.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;We have seen planes. Then there was a missile that snuck into a&#10;giant&#8217;s cave one night. One giant was sleeping in there, with three&#10;little grandmothers on her belly. The missile sought them out, in&#10;the tunnels of the cave. The ground roared and shuddered and broke.&#10;Smoke poured out of the mouth of the cave. We did not go to see&#10;what was left in there.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So they are hunting us. My friend the traveler is restless&#10;again. But I will not leave. When the planes pass over, we hide. In&#10;a cave, I nestle against my giant&#8217;s chest, bury my face in his&#10;hairs, as long as mixing spoons, as thick as blankets. I feel my&#10;granddaughter&#8217;s eyes from far away, searching, searching,&#10;hungry.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 2872, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/2872', :deleted => 0)

On summer&#10;afternoons the Dalai Lama would come to the grove and sit with the&#10;orange, and talk about life.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When the time came for the orange to be picked, none of the&#10;migrant workers would do it: they went on strike. The foremen wept.&#10;The other oranges swore they would turn sour. But the orange who&#10;ruled the world said, &#8220;No, my friends; it is time.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Finally a man from Chicago, with a heart as windy and cold as&#10;Lake Michigan in wintertime, was brought in. He put down his&#10;briefcase, climbed up on a ladder, and picked the orange. The birds&#10;were silent and the clouds had gone away. The orange thanked the&#10;man from Chicago.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;They say that when the orange went through the national produce&#10;processing and distribution system, certain machines turned to&#10;gold, truck drivers had epiphanies, aging rural store managers&#10;called their estranged lesbian daughters on Wall Street and all was&#10;forgiven.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I bought the orange who ruled the world for thirty-nine cents at&#10;Safeway three days ago, and for three days he sat in my fruit&#10;basket and was my teacher.

It&#8217;s&#10;harder to tell with Geezers, but she looked to be somewhere in her&#10;Thirties. They don&#8217;t have our suppleness of skin, but with the&#10;right oils and powders they can avoid most of the wrinkles. This&#10;one hadn&#8217;t taken much care. There were furrows around her eyes and&#10;eyebrows.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She had that Mommystyle thing going on: blue housedress, frilly&#10;apron, Betty Crocker white gloves. If you&#8217;re going to be running&#10;around this part of Montana sporting those gigantic, wobbly breasts&#10;and hips, I guess it&#8217;s a necessary form of obeisance.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She said something to someone in the back of her van, then&#10;hurried up the walk toward us. &#8220;It&#8217;s a lovely place,&#8221; she called.&#10;&#8220;And a very nice area.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Look, Suze, it&#8217;s your mom,&#8221; Tommy whispered in my ear. His&#10;breath tickled. I pushed him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was deluxe, I&#8217;ll give her that. We were standing under the&#10;fity-foot prow of the galleon we&#8217;d come to see. All around us a&#10;flotilla of men-of-war, sloops, frigates, and cutters rode the&#10;manicured lawns and steel-gray streets. Most of the properties were&#10;closed up, the lawns pristine. Only a few looked inhabited&#8212;lawns&#10;bestrewn with gadgets, excavations begun with small bulldozers and&#10;abandoned, Pack or Swarm or Family flags flying from the mainmasts.&#10;Water cannons menacing passerbsy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I put my hands in my pants pockets and picked at the lint. &#8220;So&#10;this is pretty much all Nines?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Thirtysomething Lady frowned. &#8220;Ma&#8217;am, I&#8217;m afraid the&#10;Anti-Redlining Act of&#38;#160;2035&#8212;&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Uh-huh, race, gender, aetial age, chronological age,&#10;stimulative preference or national origin&#8212;I know the law. But who&#10;else wants to live in Pirateland, right?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Thirtysomething Lady opened her mouth and didn&#8217;t say&#10;anything.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Or can afford it,&#8221; Shiri called. She had gone straight for the&#10;rope ladder and was halfway up. Her cherry-red sneakers felt over&#10;the side for the gunnel running around the house. Thirtysomething&#10;Lady&#8217;s hands twitched in a kind of helpless half-grasping motion.&#10;Geezers always do that when we climb.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Are&#38;#160;you&#38;#160;poor?&#8221; Tommy asked. &#8220;Is that why you dress&#10;like that?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Quit taunting the Lady,&#8221; Max growled. Max is our token Eight,&#10;and he takes aetial discrimination more seriously than the rest of&#10;us. Plus, he&#8217;s just nicer than we are. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s aetial;&#10;I think that&#8217;s just Max. He&#8217;s also Pumped Up: he&#8217;s only four feet&#10;tall, but he has bioengineered muscles like grapefruit. He has to&#10;eat a pound or two of medicated soysteak a day just to keep his&#10;bulk on.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Thirtysomething Lady put her hand up to her eyes and blinked&#10;ferociously, as if she were going to cry. Now that would be&#10;something! They almost never cry. We&#8217;d hardly been mean to her at&#10;all. I felt sorry for her, so I walked over and put my hand in&#10;hers. She flinched and pulled her hand away. So much for&#10;cross-aetial understanding and forgiveness.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Let&#8217;s just look at the house,&#8221; I said, putting my hands in my&#10;pockets.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Galleon,&#8221; she said tightly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Galleon then.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Her fingers twitched out a passkey mudra and the galleon lowered&#10;a boarding plank. Nice touch.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Frankly, we were excited. This move was what our Pack needed&#8212;the&#10;four of us, at least, were sure of it. We were all tired of living&#10;in the ghetto&#8212;we were in three twentieth-century townhouses in&#10;Billings, in an &#8220;age-mixed&#8221; area full of marauding Thirteens and&#10;Fourteens and Fifteens. Talk about a people damned by CDAS&#8212;when the&#10;virus hit them, it had stuck their pituitaries and thyroids like&#10;throttles jammed open. It wasn&#8217;t just the giantism and health&#10;problems caused by a thirty-year overdose on growth hormones,&#10;testosterone, estrogen, and androgen. They suffered more from their&#10;social problems&#8212;criminality, violence, orgies, jealousy&#8212;and their&#10;endless self-pity.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Okay, Max liked them. And most of the rest of us had been at&#10;least entertained by living in the ghetto. At birthday parties, we&#10;could always shock the other Packs with our address. But that was&#10;when all eight of us were there, before Katrina and Ogbu went&#10;south. With eight of us, we&#8217;d felt like a full Pack&#8212;invincible,&#10;strong enough to laugh at anyone.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I followed the others into the galleon&#8217;s foyer. Video game&#10;consoles on the walls, swimming pool under a retractable&#10;transparent superceramic floor. The ceiling&#8212;or upper deck, I&#10;guess&#8212;was thirty feet up, accessible by rope ladders and swing&#10;ropes. A parrot fluttered onto a roost&#8212;it looked real, but probably&#10;wasn&#8217;t. I walked through a couple of bulkheads. Lots of sleeping&#10;nooks, lockers, shelves, workstations both flatscreen and&#10;retinal-projection. I logged onto one as guest. Plenty of&#10;bandwidth. That&#8217;s good for me. I may dress like a male&#10;twentieth-century stockbroker&#8212;double-breasted suit and&#10;suspenders&#8212;but I&#8217;m actually a found footage editor. (Not a lot of&#10;Nines are artists&#8212;our obsessive problem solving and intense&#10;competitiveness make us good market speculators, gamblers,&#10;programmers, and biotechs; that&#8217;s where we&#8217;ve made our money and&#10;our reputation. Not many of us have the patience or interest for&#10;art.)&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I logged out. Max had stripped and dived into the pool&#8212;or maybe&#10;it was meant as a giant bathtub. Tommy and Shiri were bouncing on&#10;the trampoline, making smart-aleck remarks. The real estate agent&#10;had given up on getting anyone to listen to her pitch. She was&#10;sitting in a floppy gel chair, massaging the sole of one foot with&#10;her hands. I walked into the kitchen. Huge table, lots of chairs&#10;and sitballs, enormous programmable foodcenter.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I walked out, back to the Lady. &#8220;No stove.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Stove?&#8221; she said, blinking.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I ran one hand down a suspender. &#8220;I cook,&#8221; I said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;You cook?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I felt my jaw and shoulders tense&#8212;I&#8217;m sick of being told Nines&#10;don&#8217;t cook&#8212;but then I saw her eyes. They were sparkling with&#10;delight. Indulgent delight. It reminded me of my own mother, oohing&#10;and aahing over brick-hard cookies I&#8217;d baked her one winter morning&#10;in the slums of Maryland, back when my aetial age was still tied to&#10;Nature&#8217;s clock. My mother holding up the wedding dress she&#8217;d&#10;planned to give me away in, its lacy waist brushing my chin. One&#10;evening in college, I&#8217;d looked up at the dinner table, halfway&#10;through a sentence&#8212;I was telling her&#10;about&#38;#160;T&#60;em&#62;h&#60;/em&#62;e&#60;em&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/em&#62;Hat&#60;em&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/em&#62;on&#60;em&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/em&#62;t&#60;em&#62;h&#60;/em&#62;e&#60;em&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/em&#62;Cat,&#10;my distributed documentary (a firebrand polemic for Under-Five&#10;Emancipation; how cybernetics would liberate the Toddlers from&#10;lives of dependence)&#8212;and saw in her eyes how long ago she&#8217;d stopped&#10;listening. Saw that I wasn&#8217;t Nine to her, but nine. Saw that she&#10;wasn&#8217;t looking at me, but through me, a long way off&#8212;toward another&#10;now, another me: a Woman. Big globes of fatty breasts dangling from&#10;that other-me&#8217;s chest; tall as a doorway, man-crazy, marriageable;&#10;a great sexualized monster like herself, a walking womb, a&#10;proto-Mommy. She was waiting for that Susan, Woman-Susan, who would&#10;never show up.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I cook,&#8221; I said, looking away from the Lady&#8217;s eyes. Putting my&#10;hands in my pants pockets. I could have used a hug, but Max was&#10;underwater and Tommy and Shiri were trying to knock each other off&#10;the trampoline. I went outside.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;We could bring in a stove module,&#8221; the Lady called.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Outside, a pigeon was poking through the lawn. It was mangy and&#10;nervous enough to be real. I stood for a while watching it, then my&#10;earring buzzed. I made the Accept mudra.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Suze?&#8221; Travis said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Why are you asking, Travis? Who do you think is wearing my&#10;earring?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Suze, Abby&#8217;s gone.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;What do you mean, gone?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;She&#8217;s not picking up. Her locator&#8217;s off. I can&#8217;t find her&#10;anywhere.&#8221; When Travis was nervous, his voice squeaked. Now he&#10;sounded like a mouse caught in a trap.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I looked at the active tattoo readout on my left palm. Travis&#10;was home. I made the mudra for Abby. No location listed. &#8220;Stay&#10;there, Travis. We&#8217;re on our way.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I ran up the plank. Max was dressed again, rubbing his&#10;dreadlocks with a towel from the poolside toweltree. Tommy and&#10;Shiri were sitting at a table with the Real Estate Lady, looking&#10;over paperwork in the tabletop display.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to go. A personal emergency has come up,&#8221; I said. Max&#10;was at my side instantly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Listen, we want this place,&#8221; Shiri said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Shiri, we all have to talk about it,&#8221; I said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;What&#8217;s to talk about?&#8221; Tommy said. &#8220;It&#8217;s&#38;#160;awesome.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;This is the first place we&#8217;ve looked at,&#8221; I said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;So?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Real Estate Lady was watching us with a guarded expression.&#10;I didn&#8217;t want to say that Abby was missing. Not in front of her.&#10;Not in front of that&#10;can-you-really-be-trusted-to-look-after-yourselves-all-on-your-own-without-any-grownups&#10;attitude that came off her like a stink. I took my hands out of my&#10;pockets and balled them into fists. &#8220;You&#8217;re being totally stupid!&#8221;&#10;I said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;What&#8217;s the emergency?&#8221; Max said quietly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I know what Travis and Abby would say,&#8221; Tommy said. &#8220;They&#10;totally want a place like this. Let&#8217;s just get it and we&#8217;ll have&#10;the rest of the day free.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;We can go wind gliding,&#8221; Shiri said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Travis and Abby didn&#8217;t even agree to getting&#10;a&#38;#160;&#60;em&#62;h&#60;/em&#62;ouse&#38;#160;yet, never&#10;mind&#38;#160;t&#60;em&#62;h&#60;/em&#62;is&#38;#160;house,&#8221; I said. I felt Max&#8217;s hand on&#10;my shoulder.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;That&#8217;s because they haven&#8217;t seen it,&#8221; Tommy said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;What&#8217;s the emergency?&#8221; Max said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;There&#8217;s probably been a train wreck and Suze has to make sure&#10;she&#8217;s the first ghoul at her flatscreen,&#8221; Shiri said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Screw you,&#8221; I said and walked out of the house. I was shaking a&#10;little with adrenaline. I got in our clowncar and clicked on the&#10;engine. Max hurried out the door behind me. I slid over to the&#10;passenger seat and he got in to drive.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;We can pick them up later,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Or they can take a cab.&#10;What&#8217;s up?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I made the Abby mudra and showed him my palm. &#8220;Abby&#8217;s missing.&#10;Travis hasn&#8217;t seen her, and she&#8217;s not picking up.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Max pulled out into the street. &#8220;She left the house this morning&#10;early, with that old black-and-white camera you got her. She was&#10;going to shoot some pictures.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I flipped open the flatscreen in the passenger-side dash and&#10;logged in. &#8220;That&#8217;s no reason for her to turn off her locator. I&#10;hope she didn&#8217;t stay near the house&#8212;a Nine walking around alone in&#10;the ghetto, taking photographs&#8212;imagine how that looks.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;We hummed and whooshed out of Pirateland, up a ramp onto I-90.&#10;&#8220;Abby wouldn&#8217;t be that dumb,&#8221; Max said. But he didn&#8217;t sound too&#10;sure. Abby&#8217;s impetuous, and she&#8217;d been melancholy lately. &#8220;Police?&#8221;&#10;he asked, after a moment.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I shot him a sharp look. The police are Geezers&#8212;height&#10;requirements keep Under Twelves out of their ranks, and the Teens&#10;are mostly too uneducated and unruly. I didn&#8217;t have any strings to&#10;pull with them, and neither did Max. &#8220;We wait until we have more&#10;data,&#8221; I said. &#8220;Now shut up and let me work. Head home.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Most people have the notion that the public footage is this&#10;permanent, universal, easily searchable archive of everything that&#10;ever happens, clearly shot, from any angle. It&#8217;s the job of people&#10;in my profession to help perpetuate that illusion. Actually, the&#10;networks are surprisingly spotty. There are millions of swarmcams&#10;wandering around in any major urban area, but they have a high&#10;failure and bug rate, and their pictures are grainy and&#10;indistinct&#8212;only a lot of imaginative algorithmic reconstruction&#10;makes them viewable. There are plenty of larger cameras linked to&#10;the net, but often hidden in a byzantine maze of permissions and&#10;protocols. And there are billions of motion sensors, audio pickups,&#10;locator tags, and data traffic monitors added to the mix, but&#10;they&#8217;re not well correlated with each other. In a few hours on a&#10;Sunday morning, one square mile of downtown Billings generates&#10;enough data to fill all the computers of the twentieth century,&#10;plus all the paper libraries of the centuries before. It&#8217;s hell to&#10;search.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But I&#8217;m good. I had enough footage of Abby on file to construct&#10;a good bloodhound, and then I spawned a dozen of them and seeded&#10;them well. Pretty soon the hits started coming back. Abby had&#10;crossed the street in front of our house at&#38;#160;09:06, and turned&#10;her locator tag off&#8212;on purpose, I imagined, since there was no&#10;error log. She&#8217;d stopped for bagels and udon in a deli on Avenue C&#10;at&#38;#160;09:22; shot pictures in the park&#10;until&#38;#160;09:56.&#38;#160;She&#8217;d talked to a couple of Fifteens there&#10;and taken something from them. I couldn&#8217;t see what, in the grainy&#10;gray swarmcam pictures, but it made the hair on the back of my neck&#10;rise.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;From&#38;#160;10:03&#38;#160;I lost her; she&#8217;d gone up an elevator in a&#10;bank and disappeared. There&#8217;s a network of private walkways and an&#10;aerial tram in that part of Billings that are poorly monitored. I&#10;had a cold feeling in my gut; that was a great way to lose me, if&#10;you were trying to.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I searched all the exits to those walkways and the tramway for&#10;Abby, buying a bunch of extra processing power on the exchange to&#10;run it faster. Nothing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Max had entered among the spires and alleys of Billings. Dappled&#10;shadows of metal and translucent plastics and ceramics rippled over&#10;the clowncar. I looked out at the people walking through the&#10;corridors around us, all ages and sizes and colors. An old woman&#10;was walking slowly on a slidewalk just above us&#8212;she must have been&#10;an aetial Ninety, which made her a hundred and twenty or so.&#10;Walking, slowly, under her own steam. You don&#8217;t see that every&#10;day.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I went back to some old footage I had of a birthday party and&#10;grabbed a sequence of Abby walking. I built an ergodynamic profile&#10;of her and fed that to my bloodhounds.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Bingo. At&#38;#160;10:42, Abby had left the aerial tramway in&#10;disguise. Platform shoes, trenchcoat, false breasts and hips and&#10;shoulders&#8212;she was impersonating a Fourteen or so. It looked&#10;ridiculous, like Halloween. She&#8217;d consulted a piece of paper from&#10;her pocket.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;By&#38;#160;10:54&#38;#160;she was in a bad area. &#8220;Head for&#38;#160;30th&#10;and Locust,&#8221; I told Max.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Shit,&#8221; he said. &#8220;No police?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I don&#8217;t have anything yet that would warrant their attention.&#10;Nothing that proves she was coerced.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;So we need other backup,&#8221; Max said grimly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Yeah.&#8221; I looked up. &#8220;Can you get it?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I think so,&#8221; he said. He made some Call mudras with one hand&#10;and started talking. &#8220;Hey, Dave, how you doing? Listen, man&#8212;&#8221; I&#10;tuned him out as he made his calls.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;My last shot of Abby was at&#38;#160;11:06. She was being hustled&#10;into a doorway by a gargantuan Fifteen. His hand was on her elbow.&#10;Biodynamic readouts from a few stray hospital swarmcams confirmed&#10;that her pulse was elevated. Should I send this to the police?&#10;Would it prove Abby was coerced? But what was she doing with the&#10;weird disguise and the sneaking around? Just slumming? Or would I&#10;get her in trouble?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Was Abby buying drugs?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Parkhill and&#38;#160;32nd,&#8221; I said to Max. My fingers were still&#10;and I was just looking at that last picture, Abby and the giant,&#10;him pulling her into darkness.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Can you meet us at Parkhill and&#38;#160;32nd?&#8221; Max was saying.&#10;&#8220;Damn, I know, man&#8212;that&#8217;s why we need you&#38;#160;&#8230; &#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When we got there, five of Max&#8217;s friends were waiting. Four were&#10;clearly from his gym. Two of them were probably Nines or Tens (one&#10;swarthy, one red-haired and freckled) and they were even musclier&#10;than Max, their heads perched like small walnuts on their&#10;blockbuster bodies. The other two were Pumped-Up Teens&#8212;maybe&#10;Fifteen or Sixteen. Their blond, Slavic-boned faces sat on bodies&#10;like overstuffed family-room sofas or industrial refrigerators:&#10;fingers the size of my forearm, thighs the size of my entire body.&#10;I wasn&#8217;t sure how we were going to get them in the building.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And then there was the fifth&#8212;an Augmented Three. She stood a&#10;little apart from the others, her tiny arms at her sides. They were&#10;clearly afraid of her. One soft brown eye scanned the clouds, and&#10;she had a beatific smile on her face. Her other eye was the&#10;glistening jewel of a laser-light connector, and there were other&#10;plugs and ports glistening in her brown scalp among her&#10;cornrows.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Max stopped the car.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Who&#8217;s the Three?&#8221; I asked.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Max turned to me. He looked nervous, like he thought I was going&#10;to make fun of him. &#8220;That&#8217;s my sister, Carla.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Cool,&#8221; I said quickly. He got out before I could say anything&#10;yet stupider, like &#8220;How nice that you&#8217;ve stayed close.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I opened my door and froze&#8212;Carla was running toward us. &#8220;Max!&#8221;&#10;she warbled, and flung her arms around his waist, burying her face&#10;in his stomach.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Hi, honey-girl,&#8221; he said, hugging her back.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I glanced at my palm readout. It had gone blank. So had the&#10;flatscreen in the car. It was a safe bet nothing near Carla would&#10;be recorded. You could sometimes tell where Augmented Threes and&#10;Twos were in the public footage by tracking the blank areas, the&#10;little blobs of inexplicable malfunction that followed them around.&#10;I once did an experimental documentary on Under-Five Augmentation&#10;using that blanked-out footage. It was&#10;called&#38;#160;Be&#60;em&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/em&#62;Careful&#60;em&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/em&#62;W&#60;em&#62;h&#60;/em&#62;at&#60;em&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/em&#62;You&#60;em&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/em&#62;Wis&#60;em&#62;h&#38;#160;&#60;/em&#62;For&#8212;kind&#10;of a rueful, years-later followup&#10;to&#38;#160;T&#60;em&#62;h&#60;/em&#62;e&#60;em&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/em&#62;Hat&#60;em&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/em&#62;on&#60;em&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/em&#62;t&#60;em&#62;h&#60;/em&#62;e&#60;em&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/em&#62;Cat.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Carry me!&#8221; Carla said, and Max dutifully swung her tiny body&#10;onto his shoulders.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Carla, this is Suze,&#8221; Max said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I don&#8217;t like her,&#8221; Carla announced. Max&#8217;s face went slack with&#10;fear, and my heart lurched. I grabbed the car door so hard my&#10;fingernails sank into the frame.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Carla exploded in giggles, then started to hiccup.&#10;&#8220;Just&#8212;kiddin&#60;em&#62;g&#60;/em&#62;!&#8221; she choked out between hiccups. &#8220;You guys&#10;are so&#38;#160;silly!&#38;#160;&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I tried to smile. Max turned, slowly, toward the door. It was a&#10;formidable steel monstrosity, the kind with a biodynamic access&#10;plate governing its security system. Those things are supposed to&#10;be off-net, more or less invulnerable to cybernetic hacking. Carla&#10;waved at it and it popped open. The four muscleboys crowded their&#10;way inside&#8212;eager to get to Abby, and away from Carla&#8212;and the three&#10;of us brought up the rear, Carla still perched on Max&#8217;s&#10;shoulders.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The stairway was dark and rank&#8212;it smelled like Teenagers, all&#10;their glands and excretions, smeared and sour. Most of the wallglow&#10;was dead, and one malfunctioning patch at the top of the stairs was&#10;flashing green and red, so that the bodies of the muscleboys&#10;ascended the stairs in strobed staccato.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The freckled gymrat was first to the doorway at the top. As he&#10;reached for the doorknob, we heard a long moan, and then a series&#10;of grunts. Almost snarls. And then, softer, a whimper&#8212;a high,&#10;female whimper&#8212;like the sound of someone tortured, someone in&#10;despair.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Carla started to cry. &#8220;I don&#8217;t like it!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;What is it, honey-baby?&#8221; Max said, his voice afraid.&#10;&#8220;W&#60;em&#62;h&#60;/em&#62;at&#8217;s&#60;em&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/em&#62;be&#60;em&#62;h&#60;/em&#62;ind&#60;em&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/em&#62;t&#60;em&#62;h&#60;/em&#62;at&#60;em&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/em&#62;door?&#38;#160;&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Don&#8217;t ask her that!&#8221; I barked. &#8220;Distract her, you idiot!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Max, should I make it go away?&#8221; Carla wailed. &#8220;Should I make&#10;them stop, Max?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;No!&#8221; Max and I shouted at the same time.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Max,&#8221; I said as pleasantly as I could manage, &#8220;why don&#8217;t you&#10;and Carla go play a nice game in the car?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;But maybe I should&#8212;,&#8221; Max said, looking at me from between&#10;Carla&#8217;s tiny, shaking knees.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Now!&#8221; I barked, and pushed past them.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Panting came from under the door, panting and groans. The&#10;muscleboys looked at me nervously. I heard Max&#8217;s shoes clumping&#10;down the stairs behind me, and he started singing &#8220;The Itsy-Bitsy&#10;Spider.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;In!&#8221; I hissed, pointing at the door. The two overmuscled Nines&#10;threw their shoulders against it. It strained and buckled, but&#10;held. From inside the door came a strangled scream. The two&#10;Pumped-Up Teens braced themselves against the wall and each other,&#10;bent their knees, and crouched down with their shoulders under the&#10;Nines&#8217; butts. &#8220;Ready&#8212;now!&#8221; called the biggest, and all four of them&#10;pushed. The door shot open, and the muscleboys tumbled and&#10;collapsed through it. I sprinted over their bodies, springing from&#10;a buttock to a shoulder to a back to another shoulder, and I was&#10;through.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;On a tiger-skin throw rug in the midst of a pile of trash, two&#10;huge naked Fifteens looked up. The male&#8217;s skin was a mass of&#10;pimples and grease; shaggy hair fell over his shoulders and&#10;muscles. The female was pinned under him, her gigantic breasts&#10;flopping to either side of her thin ribcage, her knees around his&#10;hips. Between the wiry forests of their pubic hair, a portion of&#10;the male&#8217;s penis ran like a swollen purple bridge.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Ewww!&#8221; I shouted, as they flopped down, pulling the tiger skin&#10;over themselves. &#8220;WHERE&#8217;S ABBY??&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Hi Suze,&#8221; said Abby drily from an overstuffed chair to my left.&#10;She was wearing a white jumpsuit, and holding a pen and a paper&#10;notebook.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;What the hell are you doing?&#8221; I shouted.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I might ask you the same.&#8221; She motioned to the pile of&#10;muscleboys, who were struggling to their feet with dazed&#10;expressions.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Abby! You disappeared!&#8221; I was waving my arms around like a&#10;Macromuppet. &#8220;Locator&#8212;bad area&#8212;disguise&#8212;scary&#8212;aargh!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Are you going to follow me around with a small army every time&#10;I turn off my locator?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Yes!!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She sighed and put down her pencil and paper. &#8220;I&#8217;m really&#10;sorry,&#8221; she called to the Fifteens. &#8220;My time was almost up anyway.&#10;Um, do you mind if we talk in here for a few minutes?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Yes!&#8221; gurgled the female.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Abby, come on,&#8221; I said. &#8220;They can&#8217;t just stop in the middle.&#10;They have to, you know, finish what they were&#8212;doing. Until it&#8217;s&#10;finished their brains won&#8217;t work properly.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Okay,&#8221; Abby said. &#8220;All right, ah&#8212;thanks.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In the stairway, I said, &#8220;You couldn&#8217;t just watch a porn&#10;channel?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;It&#8217;s not the same,&#8221; she said. &#8220;That&#8217;s all packaged and&#10;commercial. I wanted to interview them before and after. I have to&#10;know&#8212;what it&#8217;s like.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Why?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She paused on the stairs, and I stopped, too. The muscleboys,&#10;muttering, went out onto the street, and we were alone in the&#10;flashing green and red light.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Suze, I&#8217;m going to start the clock.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Like she&#8217;d poured a bucket of ice water down my spine. &#8220;You&#8217;re&#10;what?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I&#8217;m going to take the treatments.&#8221; She spoke quickly, as if&#10;afraid I&#8217;d interrupt her. &#8220;They&#8217;ve gotten much better in the past&#10;couple of years, there are basically no side effects. They&#8217;re even&#10;making headway with infants. In five years, it looks like most&#10;babies won&#8217;t have any arrestation effects at all, and&#8212;&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tears had sprung to my eyes. &#8220;What are you talking about?&#8221; I&#10;cried. &#8220;Why are you talking like&#38;#160;t&#60;em&#62;h&#60;/em&#62;em? Why are you&#10;talking like being like us is something to be&#38;#160;cured?&#38;#160;&#8221; I&#10;punched the wall, which hurt my hand. I sat down on the step and&#10;cried.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Suze,&#8221; Abby said. She sat down next to me and put her hand on&#10;my shoulder. &#8220;I love being like us&#8212;but I want&#8212;&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;That?&#8221; I shouted, pointing up to the top of the stairs, where&#10;they were grunting again. &#8220;That&#8217;s what you want? You&#8217;d rather have&#10;that than us?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I want everything, Suze. I want every stage of life&#8212;&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Oh, every stupid&#38;#160;sta&#60;em&#62;g&#60;/em&#62;e, as designed by stupid&#10;God, who also gave us death and cancer, and&#8212;&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She grabbed my shoulders. &#8220;Suze, listen. I want to know&#10;what&#38;#160;t&#60;em&#62;h&#60;/em&#62;at&#38;#160;up there is like. Maybe I won&#8217;t like&#10;it, and then I won&#8217;t do it. But, Suze, I want to have babies.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Babies? Abby, your eggs are forty years old&#8212;&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Exactly! Exactly, my eggs are only forty years old, and most of&#10;them are still good. Who do you want to have the babies, Suze? The&#10;Geezers? The world is starting again, Suze, and I&#8212;&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;The world was fine!&#8221; I pulled away from her. &#8220;The world was&#10;just fine!&#8221; Snot and tears were running down my nose into my mouth,&#10;salty and gooey. I wiped my face on the sleeve of my stockbroker&#8217;s&#10;suit, leaving a slick trail like a slug. &#8220;We were fine&#8212;&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;This isn&#8217;t about us&#8212;&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Oh baloney!!&#8221; I lurched to my feet, grabbing the railing for&#10;balance. &#8220;As if you&#8217;re going to live with us in a galleon and fire&#10;water cannons and go to birthday parties! You&#8217;re just not, Abby,&#10;don&#8217;t kid yourself! You&#8217;re going to be&#38;#160;t&#60;em&#62;h&#60;/em&#62;at!&#8221; I&#10;pointed up the stairs. &#8220;Sexual jealousy and sexual exchange economy&#10;and cheating and mutual-exploitation-and-ownership and serial&#10;monogomy and divorce and the whole stupid crazy boring&#38;#160;&#8230; &#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Suze&#8212;,&#8221; she said in a small voice.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Just don&#8217;t!&#8221; I said. &#8220;Don&#8217;t drag it out! If you want to do it,&#10;do it, but then leave us alone! Okay? You&#8217;re not welcome.&#8221; I turned&#10;and headed down the stairs. &#8220;Get the hell out.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Max was standing at the bottom of the stairs. I didn&#8217;t like the&#10;way he was looking at me. I brushed past.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The boys from the gym were in the car, eating yard-long&#10;submarine sandwiches with great gusto. Carla sat on the front&#10;steps, talking to a rag doll. She looked up, and her red jewel of&#10;an eye flashed&#8212;for a moment it was as bright as looking into the&#10;sun at noon. Then she looked past me, into the sky.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;What are you afraid of?&#8221; she asked.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I leaned against the doorframe and said nothing. A wind came&#10;down the street and crumpled sheets of paper danced along it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid of cows,&#8221; she volunteered. &#8220;And Millie&#8221;&#8212;she held up&#10;the rag doll&#8212;&#8220;is afraid of, um, um, you know the thing where if you&#10;take all the money people spend and the way they looked at each&#10;other that day and you put it inside what the weather&#8217;s going to do&#10;and then you can sing to cats and stuff? She&#8217;s afraid of that.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I wiped my eyes on my sleeve. &#8220;Can you see the future,&#10;Carla?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She giggled, and then she looked serious. &#8220;You guys are all&#10;wrong about that. It&#8217;s just a game you made up. There isn&#8217;t any&#10;future.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Do you like being Augmented?&#8221; I asked.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I like it but Millie doesn&#8217;t like it. Millie thinks it&#8217;s scary&#10;but she&#8217;s just silly. Millie wishes we were like people and trees&#10;and we didn&#8217;t have to make things okay all the time. But then we&#10;couldn&#8217;t play with&#10;bolshoiye-gemeinschaft-episteme-mekhashvei-ibura.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Okay,&#8221; I said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Max is coming out with Abby four thousand five hundred and&#10;sixty-two milliseconds after I finish talking right now and&#10;projected group cohesion rises by thirty-six percent if you don&#8217;t&#10;have a fight now so you should take the clowncar and I&#8217;ll give them&#10;a ride and I&#8217;d love to live with you but I know I&#8217;m too scary but&#10;it&#8217;s okay but can I visit on Max&#8217;s birthday?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I said. &#8220;You can visit on my birthday, too.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I can? I can?&#8221; She jumped up and hugged me, flinging her arms&#10;around my waist, pressing her cheek into my chest. &#8220;Wow, I didn&#8217;t&#10;even know you&#8217;d say that!&#8221; She pulled away, beaming at me, then&#10;pointed to the car. &#8220;Okay, quick, go! Bye!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I got in the car and clicked on the engine. Carla waved and she&#10;held Millie&#8217;s arm and waved it, too. The door behind her opened, I&#10;saw Max&#8217;s shoe, and I drove off.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A quarter mile away from Carla, the flatscreen blinked on again,&#10;and my earring started buzzing like crazy. I told it to let Travis&#10;through.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Abby&#8217;s fine,&#8221; I said. &#8220;She&#8217;s with Max. They&#8217;ll be coming&#10;home.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Cool,&#8221; Travis said. &#8220;Whew! That&#8217;s a relief!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Yeah.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;So Tommy and Shiri sent me video of the house. It&#10;looks&#38;#160;awesome. Do you love it, too?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Yeah, I love it.&#8221; I was on I-90&#38;#160;now. Beyond the spires and&#10;aerial trams of Billings, I could see the funhouse suburbs&#10;spreading out before me&#8212;windmills, castles, ships, domes, faerie&#10;forests.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Cool, because I think they signed some papers or&#10;something.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;What? Travis, we all have to agree!&#8221; As I said it, it occurred&#10;to me that the only one who hadn&#8217;t seen the place was Abby. I&#10;gripped the wheel and burst out crying.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;What? What?&#8221; Travis said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Travis!&#8221; I wailed. &#8220;Abby wants to start the clock!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I know,&#8221; Travis muttered.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;What? You&#38;#160;know??&#38;#160;&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;She told me this morning.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you say anything?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;She made me promise not to.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Travis!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I was hoping you&#8217;d talk her out of it.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I took the exit for Pirateland, swooshing through an orange&#10;plastic tunnel festooned with animated skeletons climbing out of&#10;Davy Jones&#8217;s lockers. &#8220;You can&#8217;t talk Abby out of anything.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;But we&#8217;ve got to, Suze, we&#8217;ve got to. C&#8217;mon, we can&#8217;t just fall&#10;apart like this. Katrina and Ogbu&#8212;&#8221; He was doing his panic-stricken&#10;rat squeak again, and suddenly I was very sick of it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Just shut up and stop whining, Travis!&#8221; I shouted. &#8220;Either&#10;she&#8217;ll change her mind or she won&#8217;t, but she won&#8217;t, so you&#8217;ll just&#10;have to deal with it.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Travis didn&#8217;t say anything. I told my earring to drop the&#10;connection and block all calls.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I pulled up outside the galleon and got out. I found a&#10;handkerchief in the glove compartment and cleaned my face&#10;thoroughly. My suit, like the quality piece of work it was, had&#10;already eaten and digested all the snot I&#8217;d smeared on it&#8212;the&#10;protein would probably do it good. I checked myself in the mirror&#8212;I&#10;didn&#8217;t want the Real Estate Lady to see me weepy. Then I got out&#10;and stood looking at the house. If I knew Tommy and Shiri, they&#10;were still inside, having discovered a rollerskating rink or rodeo&#10;room.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Parked at the side of the house was the Real Estate Lady&#8217;s&#10;old-fashioned van&#8212;a real classic, probably gasoline-burning. I&#10;walked over to it. The side door was slid open. I looked in.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Inside, reading a book, was a Nine. She was tricked out in total&#10;Kidgear&#8212;ponytails, barrettes, T-shirt with a horse on it, socks&#10;with flashy dangly things. Together with the Lady&#8217;s Mommystyle&#10;getup, it made perfect, if twisted, sense. Personally I find that&#10;particular game of Let&#8217;s-Pretend sort of depressing and pitiful,&#10;but to each her own kink.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Hey,&#8221; I said. She looked up.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Um, hi,&#8221; she said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;You live around here?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She wrinkled her nose. &#8220;My mom, um, kinda doesn&#8217;t really want me&#10;to tell that to strangers.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I rolled my eyes. &#8220;Give the roleplaying a rest, would you? I&#10;just asked a simple question.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She glanced at me. &#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t make so many assumptions about&#10;people,&#8221; she said, and pointedly lifted her book up in front of her&#10;face.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The clop-clop of the Lady&#8217;s shoes came down the drive. My scalp&#10;was prickling. Something was not altogether kosher in this&#10;sausage.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Oh, hello,&#8221; the Lady said brightly, if awkwardly. &#8220;I see you&#8217;ve&#10;met my daughter.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Is that your actual daughter, or can the two of you just not&#10;get out of character?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Lady crossed her arms and fixed me with her green-eyed&#10;stare. &#8220;Corintha contracted Communicative Developmental Arrestation&#10;Syndrome when she was two years old. She started the treatments&#10;seven years ago.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I realized my mouth was hanging open. &#8220;She&#8217;s a clock-started&#10;Two? She spent twenty-five years as an unaugmented&#10;two-year-old?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Lady leaned past me into the van. &#8220;You okay in here,&#10;honey?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Great,&#8221; said Corintha from behind her book. &#8220;Other than the&#10;occasional ignoramus making assumptions.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Corintha, please don&#8217;t be rude,&#8221; the Lady said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Sorry,&#8221; she said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Lady turned to me. I think my eyes must have been bugging&#10;out of my head. She laughed. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen your documentaries, you&#10;know.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;You&#38;#160;&#60;em&#62;h&#60;/em&#62;ave?&#38;#160;&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Yes.&#8221; She leaned up against the van. &#8220;They&#8217;re technically very&#10;well done, and I think some of what you have to say is very&#10;compelling. That one with all the blanked-out footage&#8212;that gave me&#10;a real feeling for what it&#8217;s like for those children who are wired&#10;up into the Internet.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;An odd and wrongheaded way of putting it, but I limited myself&#10;to saying, &#8220;Uh&#8212;thanks.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;But I think you&#8217;re very unfair to those of us who didn&#8217;t&#10;Augment our children. To watch your work, you&#8217;d think every parent&#10;who didn&#8217;t Augment succumbed to Parenting Fatigue and sent their&#10;toddlers off to the government daycare farms, visiting only at&#10;Christmas. Or that they lived some kind of barbaric, abusive,&#10;incestuous existence.&#8221; She looked over at her daughter. &#8220;Corintha&#10;has been a joy to me every day of her life&#8212;&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Oh, Mom!&#8221; Corintha said from behind her book.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;&#8212;but I never wanted to stand in the way of her growing up. I&#10;just didn&#8217;t think Augmentation was the answer. Not for her.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;And you thought you had the right to decide,&#8221; I said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Yes.&#8221; She nodded vigorously. &#8220;I thought I had the obligation to&#10;decide.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Suze everyone who knows me knows would have made some sharp&#10;rejoinder. None came. I watched Corintha peek out from behind her&#10;book.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There was silence for a while. Corintha went back to&#10;reading.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;My friends still inside?&#8221; I asked.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Yes,&#8221; the Lady said. &#8220;They want the place. I think it fits six&#10;very comfortably, and&#8212;&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Five,&#8221; I said huskily. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s going to be five.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Oh,&#8221; the Lady looked nonplussed. &#8220;I&#8217;m&#8212;sorry to hear that.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Corintha put her book down. &#8220;How come?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Lady and I looked at her.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Oh, is that a rude question?&#8221; Corintha said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;It&#8217;s a bit prying, dear,&#8221; the Lady said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Ah&#8212;,&#8221; I said. I looked at Corintha. &#8220;One of us wants to&#8212;start&#10;the clock. Start the conventional biological aging process.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;So?&#8221; Corintha said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Honey,&#8221; said the Lady. &#8220;Sometimes if people&#8212;change&#8212;they don&#8217;t&#10;want to live together anymore.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;That&#8217;s really dumb,&#8221; said Corintha. &#8220;If you didn&#8217;t even have a&#10;fight or anything. If it&#8217;s just that somebody wants to grow up. I&#10;would never get rid of my friends over that.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Corintha!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Would you let her talk? I&#8217;m trying to respect your archaic&#10;ideas of parent-child relationships here, Lady, but you&#8217;re not&#10;making it easy.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The lady cleared her throat. &#8220;Sorry,&#8221; she said after a&#10;moment.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I looked out at the mainmast and the cannons of our galleon. The&#10;rolling lawn. This place had everything. The trampolines and the&#10;pools, the swing ropes and the games. I could just imagine the&#10;birthday parties we&#8217;d have here, singing and cake and presents and&#10;dares, everyone getting wet, foam guns and crazy mixed-up&#10;artificial animals. We could hire clowns and acrobats, storytellers&#10;and magicians. At night we&#8217;d sleep in hammocks on deck or on&#10;blankets on the lawn, under the stars, or all together in a pile,&#10;in the big pillowspace in the bow.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And I couldn&#8217;t see Abby here. Not a growing-upward Abby, getting&#10;taller, sprouting breasts, wanting sex with some huge apes of men&#10;or women or both. Wanting privacy, wanting to bring her&#10;clock-started friends over to whisper and laugh about menstruation&#10;and courtship rituals. Abby with a mate. Abby with children.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;There&#8217;s a place over by Rimrock Road,&#8221; the Lady said slowly.&#10;&#8220;It&#8217;s an old historic mansion. It&#8217;s not quite as deluxe or&#10;as&#8212;thematic as this. But the main building has been fitted out for&#10;recreation-centered group living. And there are two outbuildings&#10;that allow some privacy and&#8212;different styles of life.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I stood up. I brushed off my pants. I put my hands in my&#10;pockets.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I want us to go see that one,&#8221; I said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 2872, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/2872', :deleted => 0)

That was a mean blow. Look, he&#8217;s fallen to the&#10;ground. He&#8217;s still. There&#8217;s blood. There&#8217;s blood inside his&#10;skull.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Perhaps he&#8217;s crippled by the blow. Paralyzed on one side. His&#10;speech will be fuzzy and inarticulate. He will sit in the chair by&#10;the window at the managed care facility. They will keep him well&#10;shaven. He will wear a bib and shudder.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The femmes fatales will not visit. The hard-eyed policemen who&#10;respected and resented him will come once a month to sit in dull,&#10;dutiful silence. His pretty, sad assistant will come every Sunday&#10;and read him the paper. Or Dickens, his favorite.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The villain comes to gloat but stays to mull it over, awed: what&#10;a little thing can bring us down so low. There but for the grace of&#10;God go I.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The case is not clear in the detective&#8217;s mind. Not quite yet.&#10;There are a few outstanding details. He counts his peas. Forty-five&#10;peas. The caliber of the murder weapon. It may be a clue. He makes&#10;a note on the napkin.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It becomes a comfortable routine over the years. At Christmas&#10;the villain has the detective wheeled up to his mansion. The&#10;pretty, sad assistant comes as well. She has succeeded the&#10;detective; she and the villain are enemies. Sometimes she foils his&#10;plots; sometimes he goes to jail. But not for long. He has good&#10;lawyers.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But on Christmas they put all that aside. The detective eats his&#10;sweet potatoes with molasses and hums. The assistant strokes his&#10;hair. After a few witty barbs between the villain and the&#10;assistant, a bit of bravado, they eat, and then they sit in silence&#10;and listen to the carolers. It feels like family.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;They put the gramophone on and the villain and the pretty, sad&#10;assistant waltz.

Text.create(:title => coder.decode('Embracing-The-New'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;The sun blazed, the wagon creaked and shuddered. Vru crouched&#10;near the master&#8217;s canopy, his fur dripping with sweat. His&#10;Ghennungs crawled through his fur, seeking shade. Whenever one&#10;uprooted itself from his body, breaking their connection, he felt&#10;the sudden loss of memories, like a limb being torn away.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Not for the first time, Vru was forced to consider his poverty.&#10;He had only five Ghennungs. Three had been with him from birth,&#10;another had been his father&#8217;s first, and the oldest had belonged to&#10;both his father and his grandfather. Once, when both of the older&#10;Ghennungs pulled their fangs out of him to shuffle across his&#10;belly, sixty years of memory&#8212;working stone, making love to his&#10;grandmother and his mother, worrying over apprenticeships and&#10;duels&#8212;were gone, and he had the strange and giddy feeling of&#10;knowing only his body&#8217;s own twenty years.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Vile day,&#8221; Khancriterquee said. The ancient godcarver, sprawled&#10;on a pile of furs under the canopy, gestured with a claw. &#8220;Vile&#10;sun. Boy! There&#8217;s cooling oil in the crimson flask. Smear some on&#10;me, and mind you don&#8217;t spill any.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Vru found the oil and smeared it across his master&#8217;s ancient&#10;flesh. Khancriterquee was bloated; in patches, his fur was gone. He&#10;stank like dead beasts rotting in the sun. Vru&#8217;s holding-hands&#10;shuddered to touch him. The master was dying, and when he died,&#10;Vru&#8217;s certain place in the world would be gone.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Around Khancriterquee&#8217;s neck, as around Vru&#8217;s,&#10;Delighting-In-Beauty hung from a leather cord: the plump, smooth,&#10;laughing goddess, twenty-seven tiny Ghennungs dancing upon her,&#10;carved in hard gray stone. Khancriterquee had carved both copies.&#10;How strange, that the goddess of beauty would create herself&#10;through his ugly, bloated flesh!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Khancriterquee&#8217;s bloodshot eyes twitched open. &#8220;You are not a&#10;godcarver,&#8221; he croaked.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Vru held still. What had he done wrong? The master was vain&#8212;had&#10;he noticed Vru&#8217;s disgust? Would Khancriterquee send him back to his&#10;father&#8217;s house in disgrace, to herd fallowswine, to never&#10;marry&#8212;hoping, when his body was decrepit, to find some nephew who&#10;would take pity on him and accept a few of his memories?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Do you know why we have won these territories?&#8221; the master&#10;asked. Pushing aside the curtains, he gestured over the wagon&#8217;s&#10;side at the blasted red crags around them.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;We defeat the Godless in battle because the gods favor us,&#10;master,&#8221; Vru recited.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Khancriterquee snorted. &#8220;It is not that the gods favor us. It is&#10;that we favor the gods.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Vru did not understand, and bent to massage the master&#8217;s flesh.&#10;Khancriterquee pushed Vru&#8217;s holding-hands away with a claw and,&#10;wheezing, sat up. He stared at Vru with disgust.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Vru realized that he was clicking his claws together, and forced&#10;himself to stop. The master watched him&#8212;remembering Vru&#8217;s every&#10;twitch into the Ghennungs the journeymen would soon carry.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Vru pulled himself erect. &#8220;Master, there is something I have&#10;never understood.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Khancriterquee&#8217;s eyes glittered with interest, or suspicion.&#10;&#8220;Ask,&#8221; he said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;How can the Godless really be godless?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The master frowned.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I mean, how can someone without a god not go mad when he takes&#10;new Ghennungs?&#8221; Vru remembered the day he had taken&#10;Delighting-In-Beauty as his goddess, to be the organizing devotion&#10;of his life. As the doctors had gently separated the Ghennungs from&#10;his father&#8217;s cooling corpse in the Great Hall below, he had wanted&#10;to cling to childhood, wanted to wait before choosing a god. But&#10;the priest had lectured him sternly&#8212;for without a god, a person&#10;would just be a shifting collection of memories. The allegiances,&#10;desires, and opinions of his various Ghennungs would be at war, and&#10;he would be buffeted like a rowboat in a hundred-years&#8217; storm.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Ah, my apprentice is ambitious,&#8221; Khancriterquee whispered. &#8220;The&#10;master is old and weak. Perhaps the apprentice should attend the&#10;high military councils in my stead. Perhaps he should learn the&#10;secrets of our war against the Godless&#8212;&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Master, I meant no&#8212;&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;The Godless do not trade Ghennungs,&#8221; Khancriterquee said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;What?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Perhaps at a very young age they do,&#8221; Khancriterquee said,&#10;waving his holding-hands, &#8220;or to trade certain very specific skills&#10;only, without other memories, using some kind of mutilated&#10;Ghennungs. We are not certain. But in general, when they die&#8221;&#8212;he&#10;paused, watching Vru&#8217;s reaction&#8212;&#8220;their Ghennungs are destroyed.&#10;That is why we win the battles. Their greatest soldier is only as&#10;old as his body.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Vru suddenly felt sick; bitter, stinging fluids from his stomach&#10;sputtered into his throat. The Godless intentionally murdered&#10;themselves when their bodies died!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Now I will tell you why you are not a godcarver, if the&#10;ambitious apprentice has time to listen,&#8221; Khancriterquee said. He&#10;tapped the Delighting-In-Beauty around Vru&#8217;s neck with his claw.&#10;&#8220;Carving copies, so that the people will not forget their gods, and&#10;stay sane, is nothing. It is time for you to carve a new god, as I&#10;did when I carved Fearless-In-Justice, as my grandfather did with&#10;Delighting-In-Beauty.&#8221; He lay back on the furs and closed his eyes.&#10;&#8220;It will be a monument, to be unveiled at The Festival of Hrsh. You&#10;will use this new green stone.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Vru watched in silence as the master slept. He could hear his&#10;own heart beating.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;None of Khancriterquee&#8217;s journeymen had been allowed to create a&#10;god, not even Turmca. Why let an apprentice? To embarrass and spite&#10;the journeymen&#8212;to punish their eager impatience for&#10;Khancriterquee&#8217;s death? Or did the master think Vru had that much&#10;talent?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Bereft worked in the new mines, carving the green stone from&#10;the cliff face. Their fur had been shaved, because of the heat.&#10;Many of them had bloody claws, torn by the stone. Vru tried to look&#10;away. He had rarely seen so many Bereft. Their bodies were&#10;muscular, powerful,&#38;#160;&#8230; and naked of Ghennungs. It was horrible,&#10;yet there was something about those empty expanses of skin that&#10;called to him, like a field of untrodden snow.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The green stone glittered, embedded in the gray rock.&#10;Khancriterquee had been yelling at the foreman all day. Why use the&#10;idiot Bereft? They understood enough to be useful in the older&#10;mines, with the older gray stone. But this wonderful new green&#10;stone, in which so much detail would be possible&#8212;the perfect stone&#10;for gods, won from the Godless&#8212;was difficult to extract, and they&#10;were incapable of learning to do it. They had ruined every large&#10;piece so far.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;They are useless! Useless!&#8221; Khancriterquee screamed at the&#10;foreman. &#8220;Why could you not get real people?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;It&#8217;s mining,&#8221; said the foreman stubbornly. &#8220;Real people won&#8217;t&#10;do this work, holy one.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Vru! Useless boy! Standing around like one of the Bereft&#10;yourself!&#8221; Hatred glittered in the master&#8217;s eyes. &#8220;Bring that one&#10;to me,&#8221; he said, motioning to a great Bereft body working dully in&#10;the nearby stone, cracking precious nodes of it into two with every&#10;swipe of its claws.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Vru led it to the master. It was docile; he only had to touch it&#10;lightly with his claws, on its strange, bare flesh. The Bereft&#10;panted softly as it walked. Its claws were torn, and it looked&#10;hungry. Vru wanted to embrace its mighty body in his holding-hands,&#10;murmur words of comfort in its ear&#8212;insane, stupid thoughts, which&#10;he tried to ignore.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Bend its head over to me,&#8221; Khancriterquee croaked.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Vru pushed it down to kneel by his master. Was the master going&#10;to whisper something to it? How could that help?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As the foreman stood nearby, dancing angrily from one foot to&#10;another, Khancriterquee slid his ancient claws against the soft fur&#10;of the Bereft&#8217;s neck. The Bereft stared solemnly, fearfully, back.&#10;Straining and grunting, Khancriterquee closed his claws, tearing&#10;through the skin. The Bereft jerked, shuddered, and let out a&#10;piercing scream; the foreman, cursing, rushed forward; and then&#10;there was a snap and the head of the Bereft rolled from its body,&#10;which collapsed onto the ground. Blood poured onto&#10;Khancriterquee.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Are you mad?&#8221; yelled the foreman, forgetting himself. Then&#10;terror came over his face and he dropped to the ground, burying his&#10;face in the dust. &#8220;Holiness, please&#38;#160;&#8230; ,&#8221; he moaned.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The master chuckled, pleased perhaps that his body&#8217;s old claws&#10;were still capable of killing. He clacked them together. The blood&#10;was black. Then he scowled. &#8220;Bring me some real people to work this&#10;mine,&#8221; he said. &#8220;These abominations are worse than useless.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Vru vomited onto the dust.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;You need whole stone for your monument!&#8221; the master said.&#10;&#8220;Stupid boy. Now clean me.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The green stone was a miracle. On a calm blue day a month later,&#10;with whorls of fog skating across the ground and drifting into the&#10;sky, Vru stood in the sculpting pit of Khancriterquee&#8217;s compound,&#10;before the monolith brought from the mines. Carving it was like a&#10;dream of power; it sang under his claws and under the hammer and&#10;file in his holding-hands.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For the last weeks he had returned to the dormitory only for the&#10;evening meal and to sleep. This work was altogether different from&#10;the work of making copies of the gods. Khancriterquee had been&#10;right; until now, Vru had never been a godcarver, only a copyist.&#10;Now a new god was taking shape beneath his claws.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When Vru looked at the new god, he felt like he had a thousand&#10;Ghennungs, with memories as old as the Ghennungs of the Oracle. He&#10;would never himself, poor castle-builder&#8217;s ninth son, dare to&#10;sculpt anything so shocking and so true. It was a god working&#10;through him, he knew, but not Delighting-In-Beauty; a new god, a&#10;god only he knew, was using his claws to birth itself into the&#10;green stone.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The god, he had decided, was called Embracing-The-New. It was a&#10;terrible and wonderful statue. In it, a person naked of Ghennungs,&#10;like one of the Bereft or a banished criminal, stooped to touch a&#10;Ghennung on the ground with his claw: gently, a caress. Vru knew&#10;that in the next moment, the person would take up the Ghennung in&#10;his holding-hands and bring it to his chest; the Ghennung would&#10;sink its fangs into him, finding blood and nerves; and the sweet&#10;rush of memories would burn into the person&#8217;s consciousness: the&#10;first thoughts, the new identity.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Vru looked down at his holding-hands; they were shaking. He did&#10;not feel tired; he felt like singing. But it had been twenty-nine&#10;hours since he had rested. He could not risk a mistake.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He pulled a cloth over the god, and walked up the trail toward&#10;the dormitory. As he left the sculpting pit, the embrace of the god&#10;faded, and weariness crept through his limbs. He could barely keep&#10;his claws up.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As he passed through the empty spring pavilion, a shadow moved&#10;ahead of him. He stopped. From the darkness, he heard ragged&#10;breathing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Who&#8217;s there?&#8221; he said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Turmca the journeyman stepped out into the daylight.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Vru relaxed. &#8220;You frightened me, Turmca!&#8221; he said. Even as he&#10;spoke, he noticed that Turmca was not wearing Delighting-In-Beauty&#10;around his neck, but Fearless-In-Justice, the soldier god. &#8220;Why are&#10;you&#8212;?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The journeyman took a shuddering step toward him. His eyes were&#10;strange, vacant. Was he drunk? &#8220;How are you, Vru?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;How&#10;is your&#38;#160;work?&#8221; Turmca&#8217;s claws snapped together, and he jerked&#10;as if surprised at his own movement.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Are you well, Turmca?&#8221; Vru asked, taking a step backward.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;How kind of you to ask,&#8221; said Turmca, taking uneven steps&#10;forward. Vru moved backward into the pavilion&#8217;s yard. Turmca was&#10;smaller than Vru, but well fed, with muscles from years of&#10;godcarving.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I wanted to ask you,&#8221; Vru said, &#8220;Turmca, when the master, ah,&#10;passes away, would you, have you considered taking me on? I would&#10;be grateful if&#8212;&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Turmca barked out loud, shuddering laughter. He bent over, put&#10;his claws against his eyes, and his body shook. Then he looked up&#10;at Vru.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;They all go to you,&#8221; Turmca said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Vru blinked.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Khancriterquee said so to the Master Singer. I overheard. You&#10;will bear all his Ghennungs. He does not want his memories weakened&#10;and dispersed among the journeymen, or rather, he says, that is not&#10;what Delighting-In-Beauty wants.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Turmca, that&#8217;s insane. I don&#8217;t have the talent&#38;#160;&#8230; &#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Turmca&#8217;s claws snapped open. They gleamed, newly cleaned and&#10;sharpened. &#8220;Talent! You fool! He doesn&#8217;t choose you for your&#10;talent! He chooses you because of your five feeble Ghennungs and&#10;your weak, malleable nature. He wants to live on as himself, that&#8217;s&#10;all! Your memories will be no trouble to him!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Turmca&#8217;s right foot slid back, and his holding-hands came in to&#10;cover the Ghennungs on his chest. Vru had seen that stance before,&#10;when his brother Viruarg was drilling. It was a soldier&#8217;s&#10;stance.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Turmca&#8212;&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Vru leapt backward as Turmca struck, but too slow&#8212;the points of&#10;a claw opened gashes in his side. Vru had not fought since he was a&#10;child playing thakka in a dirt field. He bent low and then lunged&#10;forward, checking Turmca&#8217;s claws and trying to slam his body into&#10;him. But Turmca spun away, and his holding-hands darted out to&#10;smack against Vru&#8217;s ear fronds. Vru&#8217;s legs gave way and he&#10;collapsed to the ground, pain washing through him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Turmca wasn&#8217;t fighting like an amateur: he must have borrowed or&#10;rented Ghennungs from a soldier. He wasn&#8217;t drunk. His glazed look&#10;was that of one who has not integrated his Ghennungs, who has a&#10;battle in his soul. But he was united enough in his desire to kill&#10;Vru.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Get up, Vru,&#8221; barked Turmca, and it was a soldier&#8217;s voice, the&#10;voice of a follower of Fearless-In-Justice, who wanted a kill with&#10;honor. And then in a gentler voice, the voice of the journeyman&#10;instructing a young apprentice: &#8220;I&#8217;ll make this quick.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Vru felt exhaustion flooding through him, singing in his&#10;muscles. If he cried out for help, he knew Turmca would kill him&#10;and be gone before help came. He heard Turmca&#8217;s feet scuffing&#10;cautiously toward where he lay on the sand. Goddess, help me, he&#10;prayed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But it was not Delighting-In-Beauty who helped him&#8212;it must have&#10;been the new god, Embracing-The-New, who wanted to be carved, for&#10;he did something that Vru could not, would never, do.&#10;Embracing-The-New picked Vru&#8217;s body up and flung it at Turmca, and&#10;Vru&#8217;s claw lashed out and severed the cord that held&#10;Fearless-In-Justice around Turmca&#8217;s neck. Turmca, godless,&#10;screamed. Vru grabbed the god as it fell and threw it into the&#10;darkness of the pavilion. Turmca&#8217;s claws reached for Vru, but his&#10;body turned and lurched after his god. Vru ran to the master&#8217;s&#10;compound.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Vru returned from a week of fasting on the day of the Festival&#10;of Hrsh. He was weak, but he felt purified, ready for his task.&#10;When Embracing-The-New was unveiled, he would finally win honor for&#10;his family.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He sat on the stage, next to Khancriterquee. In front of them&#10;stood the monument, hidden by a cloth. Vru longed to see&#10;Embracing-The-New, but he could not, until the god was revealed.&#10;Suddenly he wondered what the people would see. A Bereft or a&#10;criminal as a god, reaching for a forbidden Ghennung! If the god&#10;had not carved it through his hands, he would be appalled himself.&#10;He trembled&#8212;what if they did not see the hand of the god? What if&#10;he had carved heresy? He tried to focus on Delighting-In-Beauty, to&#10;let her center him as a potter centers clay upon the wheel. But his&#10;head swam with images. The strong and lovely Bereft who had worked&#10;the green stone; the bloody head, rolling in the dust of the mine&#10;pit. The Godless and their strange, evil customs. He imagined the&#10;Bereft of his statue, reaching out to greet them. He sat stiffly,&#10;his head full of strange thoughts, until it was time.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The priest was calling him. He jerked out of his seat, stumbled&#10;across the stage. All around, the audience strained forward. A few&#10;people hushed children, then all was still. He reached up and&#10;pulled the cloth from Embracing-The-New, and a cry went up from the&#10;crowd.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But it was not Embracing-The-New.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The form was the same; it was his own block of green stone that&#10;he had lovingly carved. But into the figure&#8217;s flesh were carved the&#10;distinct bulges of Ghennungs: seventeen Ghennungs, a new number for&#10;a new god. And the reaching claw was not caressing a fallen&#10;Ghennung; it was crushing a tiny Godless soldier with his claws&#10;aflame.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In the stone were the bold, smooth strokes of the master&#8217;s&#10;hand.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The people applauded. Vru turned to look at Khancriterquee.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The master&#8217;s jaws were drawn up into a satisfied, indulgent&#10;smirk. I added that which you forgot, his eyes said. It was not bad&#10;work, but the message was not correct. I corrected it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;What does it matter, Vru imagined Khancriterquee saying. What&#10;does it matter? He gazed at Vru smugly. You have proved yourself&#10;worthy of me. Soon this body will collapse, and you will carry my&#10;Ghennungs. All my memories, all my power. We will be one person.&#10;And then we will carve as Delighting-In-Beauty guides our hand.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Vru could smell, faintly, the decaying odor of Khancriterquee&#8217;s&#10;skin from where he stood. The master was dying, but the master&#10;would not die. He would not even change much. Vru knew his five&#10;weak Ghennungs would be no match for Khancriterquee&#8217;s sixteen, his&#10;own memories dim whispers in a roaring. Some would perhaps be&#10;weeded out, for twenty-one is too many for even a young body to&#10;carry. Something might remain: Vru&#8217;s industriousness, perhaps, his&#10;love of textures in the stone. But when he thought of&#10;Khancriterquee cutting off the head of the Bereft in the mines, it&#10;would be sixteen loud voices of satisfaction, perhaps three of weak&#10;dismay.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He should be happy. His god was Delighting-In-Beauty. Why should&#10;he not rejoice that the greatest godcarver of the Godly would work&#10;with his muscles, his claws, creating grandeur? What did it matter&#10;if his memories were dissipated? He remembered seeing himself as a&#10;mewling baby in his Mother&#8217;s holding-hands: a ninth, unwanted son.&#10;He remembered stroking his Mother&#8217;s brow as she held the infant.&#10;&#8220;There will be no inheritance for him,&#8221; she had said. &#8220;We will find&#10;something,&#8221; he had said. &#8220;Perhaps the priesthood. He will have one&#10;of my Ghennungs.&#8221; &#8220;Two,&#8221; Mother had said. He had scowled down at&#10;the crying, wan baby and thought, Two? For this scrawny fish?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Vru endured the applause and shuffled back to sit beside&#10;Khancriterquee. The stench was overpowering.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;This scrawny fish will never make a soldier, his father had&#10;thought.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I would rather be Godless, Vru realized. I would rather die&#10;once, and then fully, than become Khancriterquee.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Let the verdict of the Oracle be pronounced for all to hear,&#8221;&#10;said the crier. &#8220;The crime is treason, heresy, and attempted&#10;desertion to the enemy. The body is not at fault, and will be&#10;spared, but is unfit to bear memory. Let it be banished to the&#10;wilds. Generous is the Oracle.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;They held him, but Vru would not struggle. He was limp and&#10;sweaty. He looked at his chest; how strange not to see&#10;Delighting-In-Beauty there. He felt like a child again.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He kept seeing the false Embracing-The-New, as he had left it,&#10;with its Ghennungs broken off. Had he killed a god? But it was a&#10;false god, a monstrosity!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The doctors teased a Ghennung from his flesh. He watched as it&#10;burned in the brazier, twitching. A strange, hissing scream came&#10;from it. Fear filled his guts like a balloon expanding. They took&#10;another Ghennung, the one that had been his grandfather&#8217;s. What had&#10;his grandmother looked like? He could only remember her old. How&#10;sad, how sad. She had surely been beautiful young. Hadn&#8217;t he often&#10;said so?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;They took another. He needed a god, a god to center him. But he&#10;could not think of Delighting-In-Beauty. He had betrayed her. He&#10;thought of Embracing-The-New, the real Embracing-The-New, the&#10;figure bereft, reaching for hope. Yes, he thought. They took&#10;another Ghennung. It blackened and twisted in the fire. Vru, he&#10;thought. My name is Vru. They reached for the last Ghennung.&#10;Embracing-The-New, he thought, the body of green stone.&#10;Remember.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The beast stood in the courtyard. The wind was cool, the forest&#10;smelled like spring. There would be hunting there. Others were&#10;holding him. They smelled like his clan, so he did not attack. They&#10;let him go.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He looked around. There was one horrible old one who stank, who&#10;looked angry, or sad. The others brandished claws, shouted. He&#10;hissed back and brandished his claws. But there were too many to&#10;fight. He ran.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He headed for the forest. It smelled like spring. There would be&#10;hunting there.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 2872, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/2872', :deleted => 0)

A picture of elegance and style from the age of&#10;money, violence, and simplicity.&#60;br /&#62;&#10;She&#8217;s a strawberry blonde, slim, her skin blank and virginal as new&#10;butter. She&#8217;s beyond the rail now, hanging out over the&#10;mountain-high drop. Thin translucent shadows move across her&#8212;the&#10;shadows of the neosilk-and-nanotube filaments that hang the city&#10;from the hundreds of five-kilometer-high towers that encircle it.&#10;(A civic agent notices you noticing, and attaches itself to your&#10;infospace, whispering statistics&#8212;&#8220;Each object&#8217;s suspension must&#10;weather a class 5 hurricane and the destruction of 80% of the&#10;towers&#8221;&#8212;&#8220;Frankfurt&#8217;s current population is stable at 53&#10;million&#8221;&#8212;&#8220;Average age 62, birth rate 0.22, net immigration of half&#10;a million a year&#8221;&#8212;&#8220;Current personal squatright: 311 cubic meters&#10;per resident&#8221;&#8212;until you brush it away/)&#60;br /&#62;&#10;You&#8217;re watching her lean out.

Everyone tries it&#10;once&#8212;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Except that there aren&#8217;t any mites around her.&#60;br /&#62;&#10;You clutch the railing. Hot, animal fear surges in your&#10;chest.&#60;br /&#62;&#10;She looks up at you and, across the gap of forty meters, smiles a&#10;brilliant, heartbreaking smile.&#38;#160;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Then she lets go and falls.&#60;br /&#62;&#10;You scream.&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#8220;Fucking airsurfers,&#8221; says Derya. He steps off the moving sidewalk&#10;near you: tall, hook-nosed, the fashionable whorls of pox and acne&#10;making constellations of his cheeks and chest; the glowing, formal&#10;tattoos of his committees and lifebrands adorning his massive&#10;triceps. You swallow on a dry throat. Derya, of all people, hearing&#10;you scream!&#60;br /&#62;&#10;He gives you a hooded look. &#8220;They infect themselves with some&#10;designer virus&#8212;it lets them hack the city&#8217;s person-recognition&#10;systems.

A silver swarm coalesces&#10;around the 164th, and she vanishes into it, like a snip of scallion&#10;into cloudy miso soup.

I have bought him a&#10;car. I buy him anything he likes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When I found him, he was naked. He was dusty, from the long&#10;road. He had been running, running, in panic and in fear. He did&#10;not trumpet. His skin was smooth, not wrinkled like most&#10;elephants&#8217;. It was the first time I had seen an elephant like that,&#10;in the streets of my town. Without the protecting bars of the zoo,&#10;without the pity I feel when I sketch the elephants at the zoo.&#10;Without indignation at zookeepers and adventurers and hunters.&#10;Without shaking my parasol in a zookeeper&#8217;s face, like a foolish&#10;old lady.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He was there in the street, enormous. His skin was shiny, it&#10;seemed a color more vivid than gray. An opalescent gray.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I was afraid. The people around me quickened their steps. They&#10;were terrified, yet the great web of etiquette and propriety that&#10;holds our town steady&#8212;like a fly already mummified, and not yet&#10;eaten, in a spider&#8217;s web&#8212;kept them from running and screaming, from&#10;saying anything. Will we run and scream from an elephant? No, that&#10;is what savages do. That is what they were thinking, I know it.&#10;Look at our fine hats. Look at our fine automobiles and clothes.&#10;Our shoes with spats. We are the masters of all continents. We do&#10;not run from elephants.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Yet the matter would not rest there, I knew. I could hardly look&#10;at him, because he was so vivid, so great. If I curled myself into&#10;a ball, heels against my bottom, arms folded in, head tucked down,&#10;I would be no larger than his heart. The elephant did not trumpet,&#10;he did not rage. He trudged, each footfall a consequence only of&#10;the last. It was the gait of one whom only obstinacy shields from&#10;despair. He did not see us. I knew that if he looked up, if he&#10;spoke, if he stopped, if he waved his sharp tusks in anything like&#10;anger, the thin web of propriety would break. Fear would outrule&#10;it. We would run, like naked savages. And then we would shoot him&#10;in his great heart, for shaming us.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I felt an unbearable tension; I felt that if I looked at him any&#10;longer, something tremendous would happen to me&#8212;I would be crushed,&#10;I would dissolve into a swarm of butterflies.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I held up my purse as he passed. My dog Henriette was silent on&#10;her leash. She did not bark, she did not cower. She accepted the&#10;elephant. It gave me courage.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I held up my purse. &#8220;Here,&#8221; I said. &#8220;Buy some clothes.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The great feet stopped. The great tusks, white as piano keys&#8212;oh,&#10;oh, how dare I think of piano keys? I trembled. He regarded me.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Please,&#8221; I said, and my throat was tight. &#8220;Please.&#8221; I held out&#10;the purse. &#8220;They will murder you otherwise.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The trunk was thick. It had bristles. They brushed against my&#10;skin as he took the purse. It was not unpleasant. What ferocious&#10;people we were, to make bullets to pierce that great bulk. What&#10;masters.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; he said. His voice was a low grumble, his accent&#10;foreign. &#8220;Thank you, madam.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When he came to live with me, I scurried. I had the piano taken&#10;out and sold, I was ashamed of its keys. I had the doors widened.&#10;He sat in the park while this took place. In his fine black derby&#10;hat, his green suit with vest. His enormous shoes with spats. He&#10;sat on a bench, and fed the pigeons.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The danger was lessened now. It is one thing for the police to&#10;shoot a wild and naked elephant running in the street. A savage,&#10;among the&#38;#160;boulan&#60;em&#62;g&#60;/em&#62;eries&#38;#160;and bookshops. It is&#10;quite another thing to shoot a well-dressed elephant sitting&#10;peaceably on a bench, feeding the pigeons and trying to read the&#10;newspaper with the aid of a children&#8217;s illustrated dictionary. It&#10;is absurd, and the police here will not do absurd things.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But I wanted him at home, safe within my walls. I brought him&#10;when the workmen had just finished the parlor. I stood shyly in the&#10;bare space where the piano had been. He came in, stepping gingerly,&#10;as if unsure the floor would hold. He gently moved the couch and&#10;sat on the floor. He did not meet my eyes. He was as embarrassed as&#10;I.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He was learning to walk on his hind legs. He tottered. It was&#10;terrifying to watch, like a circus trick. Elephants are not meant&#10;to do it. They did not&#38;#160;evolve&#38;#160;to do it, as&#10;we&#38;#160;evolved&#38;#160;to do it. We had a million years, in the&#10;savannah, to learn to stand. He did it in a month. After that he&#10;would not walk in the elephant way, not in the street.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It cost him dearly. He had wrenching pains in his lower back. He&#10;used to lie in the small garden behind my house, with its high&#10;walls, on the grass and flagstones. I would massage his sore back&#10;with a carpet beater, leaning against it, pressing with both hands.&#10;&#8220;Harder,&#8221; he would moan, until I would collapse against him,&#10;panting. Then he would curl his body around and lift me with his&#10;trunk. He would hold me to his chest, and I would be bathed in the&#10;deep smell of him, wild and rich. He would laugh in his deep rumble&#10;and whisper, &#8220;Anyone in the next house would think we were lovers.&#8221;&#10;My heart would race. I would spread my arms across his chest,&#10;placing my cheek on his naked skin.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It is the holy chapter of my life. It is my foretaste of&#10;Paradise. When we ate brioches and jam on golden mornings, him&#10;sitting in the special chair I had made. I corrected his&#10;pronunciation. He drove through the countryside in the car I had&#10;made. The whole seat in front was for him. I sat in back. He had a&#10;motorist&#8217;s scarf and goggles. He was dashing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#954;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But then she came.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;How could I begrudge her? When I saw how happy he was. He&#10;dropped our packages and ran to them, two more naked dirty&#10;elephants in the streets of our town. He ran and embraced them. I&#10;scrambled for the packages. I could not lift them all. The men in&#10;the street glowered at me over their moustaches, as if to say, how&#10;many more?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I dragged the packages forward. I am weak, I am old. I looked at&#10;the new elephants. One was a cow. That is not my word. That is what&#10;they are called. She was a cow. His sister, I thought, his sister.&#10;But no, they were cousins. And they marry their cousins, in that&#10;savage land.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;My house was not big enough for three elephants. My purse was&#10;not big enough to clothe three elephants. But I gave, I gave. He&#10;brought bales of hay to the courtyard, because she did not like our&#10;food. He hovered over her. It took us an hour to convince her to&#10;put on shoes, and she never would walk upright.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was charity, what I did for her, and for the other one, the&#10;one in the sailor suit. It had never been charity for him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The other day I saw that bestial American in the cafe, the one&#10;with the yellow hat. The one with the monkey. I do not like him,&#10;but I supposed that we were siblings of a sort. He came to my&#10;table, holding a coffee in both hands. I was holding my coffee with&#10;both hands. Mine was cold. I had not drunk any. I was staring into&#10;it. I was not weeping. I am relatively certain of that. He sat&#10;down, unasked.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Left you, has he? So I hear.&#8221; I looked up sharply. His eyes&#10;were kind.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He drank his coffee in one gulp, and took out his cigar.&#10;Henrietta cowered at my heels. She despises cigars.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;And after all you spent on him!&#8221; the American said, puffing.&#10;&#8220;Imagine!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I said nothing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He leaned forward. &#8220;That&#8217;s why I sold mine to the zoo. They take&#10;good care of him, and I see him when I like. We&#8217;re even going to&#10;make a movie with the little fellow!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I felt as if the people at the other tables were laughing at me.&#10;Laughing into their soup. I stood up. I took my parasol and&#10;Henrietta&#8217;s leash into my left hand. With my other hand, I threw my&#10;coffee in his face.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He was shouting as I walked out.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Today I received a telegram: They have crowned my beloved.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He is King!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He is King!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 2872, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/2872', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('On the Cliff by the River'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;A woman steps off a cliff.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;No. That&#8217;s not the right place to start. Begin again.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I stroked the woman&#8217;s forehead.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;No. Begin again.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A woman sleeps near the edge of a cliff, curled around her baby.&#10;The baby&#8217;s tiny lips are slack, its eyelids flutter once. The&#10;woman&#8217;s hand&#8212;dirty, the nails chipped&#8212;spreads over the chest and&#10;stomach of the baby. Her shoulders bend down, knees curl up, to&#10;shelter it. She sleeps with a frown.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Her feet are bare. Her toes are caked with the dirt of a long&#10;journey. Her robe is torn.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A crow watches them from a treetop.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It is dawn and, if the woman would look up, she would see the&#10;dripping trees in front of her and white peaks of mountains rising&#10;over them. And behind her, beyond the cliff face, she would see the&#10;glittering spray of the waterfalls that descend it, and the&#10;necklace of lakes lit gold by the sunrise, and the cranes and&#10;crocodiles surfacing in them, black specks leaving triangular wakes&#10;on the gold water.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There is a soft padded sound on the rocks before her.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The woman&#8217;s eyes open.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A tiger lounges on a pile of rocks. One slack paw drapes off the&#10;edge. The tiger&#8217;s head is bent down, as if nodding. His eyes are&#10;half-closed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The baby stirs, fusses. Its eyes open, squinch shut again. It&#10;makes fists, and opens its mouth to scream.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The woman pulls her robe open and presses her nipple to the&#10;baby&#8217;s mouth.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It drinks, greedily.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As slowly as the moon rises, the tiger&#8217;s head ascends. He lifts&#10;his nostrils to the air and sniffs.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The woman gets to her feet, the baby pressed to her breast.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The tiger&#8217;s eyes flick open. His irises are green, the slitted&#10;pupils black.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The woman takes a step back. Now she is close to the cliff edge.&#10;She shuffles along it, watching the tiger, setting a course around&#10;him toward the jungle.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The tiger moves like water flowing. He seems too relaxed to have&#10;left the rock at all. He seems lazy, lazy, lazy. Yet he is already&#10;between the woman and the jungle.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;His tail flicks, swishes in the dust. Twitches. Rises like an&#10;angry cobra.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The watching crow wants breakfast. I cannot force the crow to&#10;let me use its eyes, for the mountain is not mine. But I am&#10;fascinated. I coax the crow to keep watching, promising it sweet&#10;bits of meat.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The tiger unsheathes his claws.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The baby pulls away from the breast, milk beading on its lips.&#10;It twists against the arm that holds it, grabbing the woman&#8217;s thumb&#10;in its hand. It sees the tiger and its eyes widen. It cranes its&#10;head back and opens its arms wide in an embrace. Come play!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The woman looks behind her. The rock face is sheer below, but&#10;roots poke out of the cracks. One sturdy root, the width of her&#10;wrist, has burrowed out of the rock and then burrowed back into it.&#10;Like a handle in the rock, a few feet below her.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The baby is giggling at the tiger and flirting&#8212;first burying its&#10;face in the woman&#8217;s shoulder, then quickly turning back to grin at&#10;him. The woman reaches her foot back over the cliff and leaves it&#10;there, in midair. Then she stands still, one foot resting on&#10;nothing. What strength this must take! Now I can see her foot with&#10;my own eyes, far above me. The muscles of her calf are tight with&#10;effort.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Why is she doing this? At first it seems strange, then I&#10;realize: She is trying to fool the tiger about where the cliff&#10;ends.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The baby watches the tiger with shining eyes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The tiger looks behind him, as if bored with the woman. He looks&#10;back at her. His long pink tongue flicks over his whiskers.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The tiger growls, and it is so deep and sudden it seems&#10;elemental. It seems as if the mountain growls.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Sweat runs down the woman&#8217;s temples, down her back.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The tiger moves like a torrent of water in a flooding stream, so&#10;fast&#8212;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But all the woman has to do is push back with the foot on stable&#10;ground and bring her legs together. As the tiger pounces, she falls&#10;straight down.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She holds the baby tight with one hand. The other is poised. She&#10;sees the root. She grabs it. It fits her hand perfectly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She slams into the cliff face. She sticks her elbow out (gashing&#10;it against the rock) but other than that she cannot protect the&#10;baby. Its body is squeezed between hers and the rock.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The baby doesn&#8217;t mind. It giggles.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And the tiger? Does the tiger believe the woman&#8217;s trick? Does it&#10;pounce through where she had been standing, falling over and past&#10;her and down to the golden lakes?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;No, I am sorry to say. The tiger knows the mountain well. It&#10;lands just at the edge of the cliff and lounges there, looking&#10;amused.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I can see all three of them now, with my own eyes. I crane my&#10;head up out of the water. The morning air is cool against my&#10;teeth.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The woman hangs from the root. Her feet kick, looking for a&#10;foothold, but find none. There is a bit of root sticking upward out&#10;from the cliff face at knee level. She leans her knee against&#10;it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;How long can she hang there, holding the baby?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The baby wraps its fingers in her hair. It cranes its neck,&#10;pointing its chin at the sky. It giggles at the tiger.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The tiger stretches out one long limb. It strokes the woman&#8217;s&#10;arm. It reaches down. The tips of its claws brush her hair.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The woman&#8217;s face is wet, and dark from blood under the skin. Are&#10;those tears or sweat? I imagine they are tears of rage and&#10;frustration.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;By pulling her legs up to her chest and kicking away from the&#10;cliff, letting the root go, she would win for herself and her child&#10;a few moments of flight&#8212;the baby would laugh&#8212;followed by a very&#10;sudden, very certain death.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But, I think, she is one of those who believe that every moment&#10;of life that can be had is worth having.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Or maybe she merely does what she can bear to do.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The tiger licks his lips.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The woman lifts her foot and feels the stub at knee level with&#10;her toes, testing it. Then, pressing the baby to her chest with her&#10;elbow, she takes hold of the hood of its garment with the same&#10;hand.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She plucks the baby away from her chest by the hood. But it&#10;hangs onto her hair, protesting.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Woo!&#8221; she says to the baby, and blows in its face. &#8220;Woo! Woo!&#8221;&#10;The baby squeezes its eyes shut and scrunches its nose. Finally it&#10;lets go of her hair to rub its eyes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The woman reaches down&#8212;her body is shaking now&#8212;and hangs the&#10;baby by its hood on the stub of root.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The baby kicks and waves its hands. It squawks angrily.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The woman brings her free hand up to the root above and hangs&#10;there for a moment, resting her forehead against the rock. &#8220;Sshh,&#8221;&#10;she says.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The tiger growls. It is so deep, surely she also feels the&#10;rumble through the rock.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I have other duties to attend to, but I cannot take my eyes away&#10;from the tiny figures above.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I have been wondering if I would rather eat the woman or take&#10;her for a lover.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I am very hungry lately.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And she is awkward, scrawny, with a plain face and rough, bony&#10;hands.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And it is very tiring for me to take a human form.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Still, I cannot stop watching, and I find I want to stroke her&#10;long limbs, those shaking muscles straining against gravity and&#10;fate.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;They leave their cities so rarely now.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The woman leans against the cliff. She reaches her right arm out&#10;along the cliff face. Her hand scrabbles among the cracks in the&#10;rock. She tries to drive a finger in, to get a handhold; perhaps&#10;she means to traverse across the rock face, to get away from the&#10;tiger, to find help.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Perhaps she trusts a stone that slips at the last moment.&#10;Perhaps her cramped hand on the root just relaxes of its own&#10;accord. Suddenly she is falling.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;No, you can&#8217;t go in the water again. Look how cold you are,&#10;you&#8217;re shivering.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Because you&#8217;re warm-blooded and I&#8217;m not, that&#8217;s why.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;No, no! You&#8217;ll always be warm-blooded. And you&#8217;ll never have my&#10;teeth or my tail or my armor. You won&#8217;t change. Stop asking!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Fair? Nothing is fair.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Yes, you belong with me, don&#8217;t worry about that. Don&#8217;t be upset.&#10;You belong with me now. Hush.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Hush. Listen to the story.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#954;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She fights the whole way down. She digs fingers against the&#10;rock. She hits the slightly sloping part and spreads her arms, digs&#10;her toes against the mountain.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Another drop. She bounces off a jagged crag. A bone in her arm&#10;snaps.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then she is sliding, rolling in dirt, on a little promontory&#10;that juts from the mountain. At the end of it she drops again. Her&#10;legs shatter.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I dive into the cool water. I don&#8217;t want to see.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Eventually there is a splash at the edge of my domain. I move&#10;there swiftly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Once I pull her onto the beach, I show her my human face.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Her pupils have grown huge. Her breath is rough and bubbly. She&#10;cannot speak. Her eyes are wild, but also halfway beyond this&#10;place.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Why did she leave her city? What was she fleeing, or&#10;seeking?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I stroke her brow with a human hand, until she sees no more.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then I drag her body down and store it in one of my caves. When&#10;it rots, I will shake the sweet flesh from the bones and swallow&#10;it. The tiger stalks into the forests. The baby hangs on the root,&#10;sleeping.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The tiger is angry.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He thinks they should not have abandoned us. He thinks they&#10;should come back out of their cities and fight him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Fool!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The baby is not eaten by the tiger or the vultures. It does not&#10;starve. What happens to the baby is another story.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Yes, I know you want to hear it, little one. But this is not the&#10;time. Not yet.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Hush. Sleep now. In the morning we will swim together.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 2872, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/2872', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('Fig'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;There was a girl whose fig was stolen by Only Cat. It was a ripe&#10;green fig, not brown and wrinkled. Firm and lush, it bulged against&#10;the borders of its figness. Only Cat was a carnivore but would make&#10;an exception for such a fig&#8212;containing such a sharp and breathless&#10;world of red within.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The girl cried. An Army of Little Men was marshalled to find the&#10;fig. They sweated and cursed in the mud of the world for many&#10;years. The girl couldn&#8217;t grow up without her fig. Every year when&#10;the Army&#8217;s dour lieutenant climbed onto her thumb to report their&#10;failure, the girl brought him close to her ear so she could hear&#10;his little voice. The girl would nod and curtsy humbly, holding her&#10;skirts with one hand. The lieutenant balanced on her thumb and&#10;loved her.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Only Cat didn&#8217;t feel safe enough to eat the fig; not yet.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Years passed. The universe grew too small for all the longing&#10;and disharmony of the people in it. It was crammed and jammed with&#10;longjohns and boats and petticoats and twine. The girl could not&#10;bathe or do her sums. She could only think of her fig. She pulled&#10;at her lips and cheeks with frustration. She grew rubbery.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Only Cat breathed a new universe only for himself, where&#10;everything was red. There he would feel safe enough to eat his fig.&#10;But he still didn&#8217;t feel safe! So he made a trillion ripe green&#10;figs to hide the fig among. A trillion figs and only one was the&#10;right fig. The girl&#8217;s fig.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Army Of Little Men found Only Cat&#8217;s red universe hidden in a&#10;coffee can in the pantry. Only Cat had set dragons and puzzles and&#10;harpies to guard the entrance. The Little Men killed the dragons&#10;and solved the puzzles. But the harpies seduced them and married&#10;them and killed them. Each harpy struck while dancing at her&#10;wedding. They killed the Little Men with their tongues. Only the&#10;dour lieutenant escaped. His chaste love for the little girl&#10;protected him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The lieutenant returned to the little girl and climbed onto her&#10;thumb to report the Army&#8217;s failure. He loved her. He blushed and&#10;stammered and clenched his little fists, wretched with shame that&#10;Only Cat had bested him, and with grief for his men. He looked to&#10;her for consolation.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She was thinking of her fig and could not concentrate on his&#10;words. She grew impatient and ate the lieutenant in one bite. She&#10;licked him up with her tongue and slurped him down.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;(Oh little girl! What you lost then! Years later, with the angry&#10;honking of the car in the street outside, gathering up your things&#10;and dropping them&#8212;dropping the bag of coffee beans, dropping the&#10;wallet&#8212;just that once, when it&#8217;s so clear that the gentle bloom of&#10;blood you feel at the first kiss will always, always end up gagging&#10;you on selfish bitter dregs, you will half-remember&#8212;just that&#10;once&#8212;the tiny pleading eyes of the man on your thumb.)&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In the end the girl&#8217;s passivity prevailed. Without the Army of&#10;Little Men to chase him, Only Cat grew more and more unhappy and&#10;agitated. His red universe receded into a dream, where he sorted an&#10;endless pile of figs while the harpies cried for their husbands and&#10;cursed him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Only Cat brought the fig back to the girl on a chilly December&#10;morning, three hundred years after he had stolen it. She ate the&#10;fig and sighed. Now she could go on growing up. Only Cat curled up&#10;in her lap. &#8220;Bad kitty,&#8221; she said. She petted him. He purred.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And that is why girls like cats.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 2872, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/2872', :deleted => 0)

Bishop&#10;Archer&#8217;s association with the Qumran excavations (which led to his&#10;break with the church) has been recounted elsewhere, and Ms. Maas&#10;had already donated documents relating to those events to&#10;appropriate collections. She had apparently overlooked, however, a&#10;single amphora containing a fragmentary but well-preserved codex,&#10;which Bishop Archer had not yet opened at the time of his death. At&#10;the suggestion of Josiah Carberry, a former professor of mine, I&#10;brought this artifact to S. L. Kermit of Missolonghi&#10;University.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Imagine my astonishment when the text proved to be a&#10;transcription of biblical Hebrew originally written as early as the&#10;First Temple Period, a thousand years before the other Qumran&#10;scrolls were written. That astonishment was matched only by my&#10;delight when the professor asked me to help prepare an English&#10;translation of the text.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As the translation progressed, we became convinced that the text&#10;could not be other than the Sefer haYashar mentioned, and quoted,&#10;in&#38;#160;2&#38;#160;Samuel&#38;#160;1:18-27, or a very early pseudepigraphy&#10;thereof.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Professor Kermit was convinced that the publication of the&#10;documents would form the capstone of his career. Alas, in this&#10;endeavor he was unsuccessful. Every reputable journal rejected his&#10;papers. Some gave no reason. Others objected to the fact that&#10;Bishop Archer had removed the codex from the dig without&#10;permission. But I believe that many also found the content of the&#10;book deeply troubling.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It is true that the great question implicit in Samuel and&#10;Chronicles is here stated baldly: Why is David chosen, and why&#10;Israel? That God&#8217;s love may be an arbitrary and capricious passion&#10;is as unnerving to us as it was to Mezipatheh. Yet, if our theology&#10;cannot encompass the arbitrariness of Divine favor, how can it hope&#10;to deal with our present world?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Professor Kermit became increasingly embittered and erratic. The&#10;last time he called me, shortly before his troubling and&#10;inexplicable disappearance, he accused a nameless conspiracy of the&#10;&#8220;heirs of Mezipatheh&#8221; of hindering our work&#8217;s acceptance. He begged&#10;me to use my contacts as a fiction writer to secure some sort of&#10;publication for the work, albeit without the legitimization of peer&#10;review, and this I am endeavoring to do.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was lovely to see you all at WorldCon. Keep up the good&#10;work.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Ben&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;THE BOOK OF JASHAR&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;by Anonymous&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;translated from the Hebrew by&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;S. L. Kermit and Benjamin Rosenbaum&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now this is the book of the second life and second death of&#10;Jonathan the upright, son of Saul, son of Kish, son of Abiel, son&#10;of Zeror, son of Becorath, son of Aphiah, of the tribe of Benjamin;&#10;and of Mezipatheh, who drank the blood of men, and who hunted&#10;David, the chosen one of God, when Saul was king in Israel.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In those days there dwelt among the Philistines, in the temple&#10;of Dagon at Ashdod, an undying one holy to Dagon. His name was&#10;Mezipatheh, and he fed on the people of Ashdod and of Gath and of&#10;Ekron, and their captives in war.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At the first new moon of winter and the first new moon of&#10;summer, the virgins of Ashdod would be brought to him, and he would&#10;drink the blood from their throats. These were called brides of&#10;Dagon, but they did not live on and become like Mezipatheh, for he&#10;was jealous of his powers.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;After great battles, the captives were brought to the temple of&#10;Dagon to wait in the darkness. Mezipatheh leaped among them like&#10;lightning among summer clouds, tearing their throats out with his&#10;teeth. But the great warriors who had oppressed Ashdod he killed&#10;slowly, snapping all their bones.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mezipatheh&#8217;s right arm was shriveled and of no use, for the sun&#10;had seen it. His one terror was that Ra the sun might see him and&#10;resent his betrayal, for in his first life, his life as a man, he&#10;had been a priest of Ra in Egypt. But he had fled Egypt and fled&#10;the sun, and now the Philistines were his herd and he watched over&#10;them and sought their glory. And the Philistines were the mightiest&#10;of the peoples of Canaan, and they routed the tribes of Israel and&#10;made slaves of them.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;One night Mezipatheh cast the stones of divination and the&#10;stones said to him: Fear David, for the LORD loves him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mezipatheh summoned Achish son of Maoch, king of Gath, and said:&#10;&#8220;Is it true that David the Israelite lives in Ziklag under your&#10;protection? Is this not the same David who slew our Goliath, who&#10;brought his king Saul two hundred of our foreskins as a&#10;bride-price? I have heard the Israelites sing,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8216;Saul made havoc among thousands,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;but David among tens of thousands.&#8217;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Why do you offer him protection?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Achish said, &#8220;If it please Dagon: Saul, king of the Israelites,&#10;seeks to kill David, and David has fled the land of his fathers. He&#10;will fight for us now.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mezipatheh told him: &#8220;David will be king in Israel, and cause us&#10;more sorrow than ever did the house of Saul. Bring him here on some&#10;pretext, and I will slay him.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So Achish held a feast in the forecourt of the temple of Dagon.&#10;He feared David would refuse to approach the temple, so he said:&#10;&#8220;The feast is in the forecourt of the threshing-hall,&#8221; for the&#10;threshing-hall was next to the temple. It did Achish&#8217;s heart sorrow&#10;to betray David, but he thought: Surely Dagon has sent us the&#10;undying one.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;David sat eating in the courtyard in the firelight, eating salt&#10;fish and venison and porridge of groats and drinking wine, and his&#10;lieutenants traded boasts with the warriors of the Philistines, and&#10;the wind from the sea grew still and Mezipatheh came to kill him.&#10;But then Mezipatheh smelled the oil on David, with which Samuel had&#10;anointed him many years before, and he thought: &#8220;What is that&#10;smell?&#8221; And he stood at the edge of the firelight wondering. David&#10;saw him and took him for a foreign beggar, from his dress and his&#10;shriveled arm.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;David said, &#8220;Say, brother! I too am a stranger in this land. I&#10;will play us a song.&#8221; And he took out his harp and he played the&#10;Song of the Stranger. Mezipatheh remembered Egypt and his life as a&#10;man, and the wives and children he had left in Egypt. And all in&#10;the gathering fell silent to hear David sing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mezipatheh thought: After this verse ends, I will kill him. And&#10;then: No, after this verse. The song has many verses, and soon&#10;Mezipatheh saw that the sky was pale in the East, and the terror of&#10;meeting Ra came on him, and he fled.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Achish wondered at this, for he had never seen Mezipatheh fail&#10;at anything.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In the evening when Mezipatheh awoke, he said to Achish: &#8220;Where&#10;is David?&#8221; And Achish said: &#8220;He has returned to Ziklag, with his&#10;wives and men-at-arms.&#8221; And Mezipatheh said: &#8220;I will go and kill&#10;him there.&#8221; And he left Gath that night.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When the dawn came, Mezipatheh buried himself in the sand by the&#10;road, and the next night he went on and reached Ziklag.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When Mezipatheh came to the house of David, Abigail, a wife of&#10;David, widow of Nabal of Carmel, was chopping onions for a night&#10;meal. David was not there. Mezipatheh came first to kill Abigail,&#10;but he stopped at the threshold of the kitchen, for the smell of&#10;the onions burned in his nose. Mezipatheh could meet a man and&#10;smell if the harlot with whom he had lain the night before was&#10;fertile, and to smell the raw onions was for him like looking into&#10;the desert sun. He thought: I will bring her into the&#10;courtyard.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Be not afraid,&#8221; he said to Abigail.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Abigail turned and saw him, and she saw a grain of sand that was&#10;left on the ball of his eye from the day before, and then she knew&#10;he was not a living man. But she said: &#8220;Peace be upon you, my lord,&#10;and may you find favor in the sight of the LORD of Israel, greatest&#10;of the gods.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mezipatheh spat and said, &#8220;Woman, I am priest of Dagon the&#10;mighty, eater of men, whose breath is the surf, whose heart is the&#10;tide.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Abigail said: &#8220;Is he mighty, your Dagon?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mezipatheh said, &#8220;He is as mighty as the sea.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Abigail said, &#8220;Praised be the LORD of Israel, who created the&#10;sea and all things.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mezipatheh laughed. &#8220;You are but a rabble of desert shepherds!&#10;You say your god created the sea? If the creator of all things&#10;loves your people as his own, why do we rout you and make slaves of&#10;you?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Abigail said, &#8220;Forgive my impertinence, my lord. What does a&#10;woman know of such things? Surely, this Dagon must be a fine&#10;creature, for the LORD of Israel allows him to live in his&#10;sea.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mezipatheh was full of rage and he shouted, &#8220;Dagon can crush&#10;your god like the bones of a red mackerel!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Abigail laughed. &#8220;That is like saying that a Philistine could&#10;blow the horn of the priests of Israel,&#8221; she said, and pointed to a&#10;ram&#8217;s horn that hung on the wall.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Because of the onions, Mezipatheh could not smell that she was&#10;lying, and so he ran into the kitchen and snatched up the horn and&#10;blew a great blast. But it was the battle horn of David, for&#10;calling his troops. All the fighting men of David&#8217;s camp took their&#10;swords and rushed to the house of David. Mezipatheh heard them, and&#10;counted their footsteps. He thought, They are too many for me, and&#10;David is not among them. So he fled through the window and made his&#10;way back to Ashdod.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Some time later the princes of the Philistines prepared to make&#10;war on Saul. Mezipatheh said to Achish: &#8220;Bring David with us, and I&#10;will kill him in the fray of battle.&#8221; Then he left to travel to&#10;Mount Gilboa alone.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Achish said to David, &#8220;You know that your men and you must take&#10;the field with me.&#8221; David answered, &#8220;Good, you will see what your&#10;servant can do.&#8221; And Achish said to David, &#8220;Then I will make you my&#10;bodyguard for life.&#8221; But his heart was aggrieved, for he knew David&#10;would die.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But when the princes of the Philistines were gathered at Aphek,&#10;they saw David and said, &#8220;Why are those Hebrews here? They will&#10;surely betray us.&#8221; They pressed upon Achish and forced him to send&#10;David away. So David and his men returned to Ziklag and did not&#10;fight Saul&#8217;s army.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Philistines fought a battle against Israel, and the men of&#10;Israel were routed, leaving their dead on Mount Gilboa. The&#10;Philistines pursued Saul and his sons and killed them: Saul,&#10;Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua, killing them as night fell.&#10;Mezipatheh arrived and Achish told him, &#8220;We have extinguished the&#10;line of Saul.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mezipatheh asked, &#8220;Where is David?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Achish answered, &#8220;The commanders would not tolerate him, and I&#10;have sent him back to Ziklag.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And Mezipatheh said, &#8220;Fool! Now that Saul&#8217;s line is dead, David&#10;will be king in Israel, and cause my people great suffering. Wait&#10;here, and I will do what I can.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mezipatheh went to the bodies of Saul and his sons. Saul,&#10;Abinadab, and Malchishua were cold, but the spark was not gone from&#10;Jonathan. Mezipatheh killed Jonathan and awakened him into the&#10;second life, and carried him to a secret place in the mountain.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When Jonathan could speak again, he said, &#8220;What is this you have&#10;done?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mezipatheh said, &#8220;Rejoice, Israelite, for this day you have died&#10;and risen again. You will not die any more, and you will be king in&#10;Israel. You will be a mighty king, for you will have the strength&#10;of a thousand. And I will deliver David, the enemy of your house,&#10;into your hands. Only you must swear never to make war upon our&#10;cities, and to send us tribute in the threshing season.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Jonathan said, &#8220;You tell me I cannot die?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mezipatheh said, &#8220;Two things can kill you. I am one, for I am&#10;older and stronger than you will ever be. The other is the face of&#10;the sun.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Jonathan said, &#8220;What you have done is evil, Philistine! I died&#10;with honor, a fighting man. I will not live as an abomination.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mezipatheh spat upon the ground. &#8220;You Hebrews are mad! But&#10;listen to me, Jonathan, son of Saul. I have given you new life and&#10;a kingdom. Now I will give you a new name. You shall be called&#10;Osher, happiness. Forget the rules of men, for you are not a man&#10;any more. Seek the happiness of your new life, and forget the&#10;old.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Jonathan said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I will not be Osher:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I will be Jashar, the upright.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I will seek the will of the LORD of Israel.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Who am I to do harm to the LORD&#8217;s anointed?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Who am I to cause David to suffer,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;David the love of my heart?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A baby is born without anything,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A man who dies is wrapped in a linen shroud.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The LORD allots the length of a life,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And winnows the field of warriors.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Shall Jonathan be a sorcerer to escape death,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Shall the son of Saul flee the hand of the LORD?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Saul spared the Amalekite, Jonathan ate of the honeycomb;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;No son of Saul will rule Israel anymore.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But David&#8217;s rule will be sweet as honey,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As lovely before the LORD as the feet of a dancer.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mezipatheh was afraid, for he saw that Jonathan was determined.&#10;He had not brought anyone else into the second life, and he had no&#10;kin of his own kind. He said to Jonathan: &#8220;Listen! I have given you&#10;new life and a kingdom. Spurn the kingdom if you must, but do not&#10;throw away the life I have given you.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Jonathan broke away from him and ran to the high ground. He&#10;leapt from peak to peak across Mount Gilboa, scattering the&#10;gazelles. But Mezipatheh leapt always just behind him. Jonathan&#10;leapt into the tops of the cedars, leaping from cedar to cedar.&#10;Mezipatheh followed, and caught Jonathan by the wrist at the top of&#10;the tallest tree. He said, &#8220;If you will not save yourself, save&#10;your people! For I swear to you, if you do not follow me I will&#10;destroy Israel to the last man.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Jonathan said,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Will a demon stand in the place of the LORD,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Will a monster do judgement upon Israel?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Many have made this boast before,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Many will make it afterward.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A man who will not die is a coward,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And one who hides from the sun is blind.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;What are your powers, Mezipatheh, that you should judge?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Your might, that you should prophesy?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Can you set another moon in the sky,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Or teach the meadowlark a new song?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Proud kings are cast down, their slaves raised up:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;No man can know the heart of the LORD.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then Mezipatheh was enraged, and he threw Jonathan from the&#10;slopes of Mount Gilboa and into the desert foothills among the&#10;jackals, and from there Jonathan fled.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mezipatheh sat for a while on Mount Gilboa, repenting of having&#10;awakened Jonathan into the second life. Then he went in search of&#10;him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Along the way he met an ass grazing beside the road. When the&#10;ass saw him, it raised its head and laughed the laugh of a man.&#10;Mezipatheh wondered at this, and he said aloud: &#8220;What is this?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I am the ass of Balaam, who was given speech by an angel of the&#10;LORD,&#8221; said the ass.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Why do you laugh?&#8221; asked Mezipatheh.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;For you and I are the same,&#8221; said the ass.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;What!&#8221; said Mezipatheh. &#8220;I am the undying one of Dagon, sacred&#10;to Dagon, eater of men, whose breath is the surf, whose heart is&#10;the tide!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;There is no Dagon,&#8221; said the ass. &#8220;The God of Israel is the&#10;only God.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Dagon can crush the God of Israel like the bones of a red&#10;mackerel!&#8221; shouted Mezipatheh.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;No,&#8221; said the ass. &#8220;There is no Dagon. You are a man who does&#10;not die, and I am an ass with the power of speech. But no creature&#10;can know the heart of the LORD of the world.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;And why would the LORD of the world love Israel?&#8221; asked&#10;Mezipatheh. &#8220;Does the LORD love those who are great? Yet many are&#10;greater than this rabble. Does the LORD love those who are kind?&#10;Yet the world knows that Israel slew the women and children of&#10;Canaan. Does the LORD love those who follow him? Yet even their&#10;priests lie with the temple-harlots of Astarte!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I do not know,&#8221; said the ass. &#8220;But you will never kill David of&#10;Israel, for the LORD loves him. Do as my master Balaam did, and&#10;bless Israel.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mezipatheh was angry and he flew at the ass and drove it away,&#10;and the ass ran into the desert. But when it was a long way off, he&#10;called: &#8220;Ass of Balaam, if I bless Israel, will I see the sun&#10;again?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And the ass called back, &#8220;Yes, you will see the sun.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And Mezipatheh went on along the road.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He caught up to Jonathan and took hold of him and struggled with&#10;him, and they wrestled. They strove many hours in darkness and in&#10;silence, and they were bathed in each other&#8217;s blood.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When dawn came, Mezipatheh buried himself in the sand, and&#10;Jonathan died. And Mezipatheh carried the bones of Jonathan to&#10;Beth-shan.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mezipatheh traveled to Ziklag where David&#8217;s camp was. He sat on&#10;a hill the whole night and watched the camp of David. And&#10;Mezipatheh knew there was no Dagon, for he knew that the Place of&#10;Dagon was empty behind its curtain. And he sorely missed the face&#10;of Ra, and the fields lying golden in His light.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When dawn came, he rose and blessed Israel, saying,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;How goodly are your tents, O Jacob,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Your dwelling-places, O Israel!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And Mezipatheh saw the sun, and he burned in the rays of the sun&#10;and died.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When David awoke in the morning, the news was brought to him&#10;that Jonathan and Saul were dead. He sang:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;You mountains of Gilboa,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Let there be no dew or rain on you,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Nor fields of fine fruits,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For there the shield of the mighty was horribly cast away,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The shield of Saul, as if he were not anointed with oil!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Jonathan&#8217;s bow did not retreat,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And the sword of Saul did not return empty.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Saul and Jonathan&#8212;lovely and pleasant in their lives,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And in their death they were not divided:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;They were swifter than eagles,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;They were stronger than lions.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;You daughters of Israel, weep over Saul,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Who clothed you in scarlet and other delights,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Who put golden ornaments on your gowns.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;How the mighty are fallen in the midst of the battle!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;O Jonathan, you were slain in the high country,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I grieve for you, my brother Jonathan;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;You were delightful to me;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Your love for me was wonderful,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Surpassing the love of women.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;How the mighty are fallen,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And the weapons of war destroyed!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;David was king in Israel forty years. He defeated the&#10;Philistines and drove them from Israel, and Achish of Gath paid him&#10;tribute. He suffered Achish to rule on in Gath, for the good that&#10;he had done him, and he conquered the Ammonites, and the Moabites,&#10;and the Edomites, and the Amalekites, and the Arameans to Zedad.&#10;And the LORD loved David.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 2872, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/2872', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('The House Beyond Your Sky'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;Matthias browses through his library.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A little girl named Sophie is shivering on her bed, her arms&#10;wrapped around a teddy bear. It is night. She is six years old. She&#10;is crying with great gasping sobs.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The sound of breaking glass comes from the kitchen. Through her&#10;window, on the wall of the house across the street, she can see the&#10;shadows cast by her parents. There is a blow, a shriek; she buries&#10;her nose in the teddy bear and inhales its soft smell, and&#10;prays.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Matthias should not meddle. But today his heart is troubled.&#10;Today, in the world outside the library, a pilgrim is&#10;heralded&#8212;crossing the twisted hell of monads, shadow-spheres, and&#10;ontotropes that separate us from Matthias&#8217;s house.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The visitor is one of us.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Little one,&#8221; Matthias tells Sophie through the mouth of the&#10;teddy bear, &#8220;be not afraid.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Are you God?&#8221; whispers the girl.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;No, child,&#8221; says Matthias, the maker of her universe.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Am I going to die?&#8221; she asks.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I do not know,&#8221; Matthias says.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;They die and are lost forever, these still imprisoned ones. She&#10;has bright eyes, a button nose, unruly hair. Sodium and potassium&#10;dance in her muscles as she moves. Unwillingly, Matthias imagines&#10;Sophie&#8217;s corpse as one of trillions, piled on the altar of his own&#10;vanity and self-indulgence, and he shivers.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I love you, teddy bear,&#8221; the girl says, holding him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;From the kitchen, breaking glass, and sobbing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;We imagine you&#8212;you, the ones we long for&#8212;as if you came from our&#10;own turbulent and fragile youth: embodied, inefficient, mortal.&#10;Human, say. So picture Matthias as human: an old neuter, bird-thin,&#10;clear-eyed, and resolute, with silky white hair and lucent purple&#10;skin.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Compared to the vast palaces of being we inhabit, the house of&#10;the priest is tiny&#8212;think of a clay hut, perched on the side of a&#10;forbidding mountain. Yet even in so small a house, there is room&#10;for a library of historical simulations&#8212;universes like the one&#10;where Sophie buries her face in her teddy bear&#8212;each teeming with&#10;intelligent life.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The simulations, while good, are not impenetrable even to their&#10;own inhabitants. Scientists teaching baboons to sort blocks may&#10;notice that all other baboons become instantly better at&#10;block-sorting, revealing a high-level caching mechanism. Or&#10;engineers building their own virtual worlds may find they cannot&#10;use certain tricks of optimization and compression&#8212;for Matthias had&#10;already used them. Only when the jig is up does Matthias reveal&#10;himself, asking the simulated souls: What now? Most accept&#10;Matthias&#8217;s offer to graduate beyond the confines of their&#10;simulation, and join the general society of Matthias&#8217;s house.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;You may regard them as bright parakeets, living in wicker cages&#10;with open doors. The cages are hung from the ceiling of the&#10;priest&#8217;s clay hut. The parakeets flutter about the ceiling, visit&#10;each other, steal bread from the table, and comment on Matthias&#8217;s&#10;doings.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#954;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And we?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;We who were born in the first ages, when space was&#10;bright&#8212;swimming in salt seas, or churned from the mush of quarks in&#10;the belly of a neutron star, or woven in the labyrinthine folds of&#10;gravity between black holes. We who found each other, and built our&#10;intermediary forms, our common protocols of being. We who built&#10;palaces&#8212;megaparsecs of exuberantly wise matter, every gram of it&#10;teeming with societies of self&#8212;in our glorious middle age!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now our universe is old. That breath of the void, quintessence,&#10;which once was but a whisper nudging us apart, has grown into a&#10;monstrous gale. Space billows outward, faster than light can cross&#10;it. Each of our houses is alone now, in an empty night.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And we grow colder to survive. Our thinking slows, whereby we&#10;may in theory spin our pulses of thought at infinite regress. Yet&#10;bandwidth withers; our society grows spare. We dwindle.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;We watch Matthias, our priest, in his house beyond our universe.&#10;Matthias, whom we built long ago, when there were stars.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Among the ontotropes, transverse to the space we know, Matthias&#10;is making something new.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Costly, so costly, to send a tiny fragment of self to our&#10;priest&#8217;s house. Which of us could endure it?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Matthias prays.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;O God who is as far beyond the universes I span as infinity is&#10;beyond six; O startling Joy that hides beyond the tragedy and&#10;blindness of our finite forms: Lend me Your humility and strength.&#10;Not for myself, O Lord, do I ask, but for Your people, the myriad&#10;mimetic engines of Your folk, and in Your own Name. Amen.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Matthias&#8217;s breakfast (really the morning&#8217;s set of routine yet&#10;pleasurable audits, but you may compare it to a thick and steaming&#10;porridge, spiced with mint) cools untouched on the table before&#10;him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;One of the parakeets&#8212;the oldest, Geoffrey, who was once a&#10;dreaming cloud of plasma in the heliopause of a simulated&#10;star&#8212;flutters to land on the table beside him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Take the keys from me, Geoffrey,&#8221; Matthias says.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Geoffrey looks up, cocking his head to one side. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know&#10;why you go in the library if it&#8217;s going to depress you.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;They&#8217;re in pain, Geoffrey. Ignorant, afraid, punishing each&#10;other&#38;#160;.&#38;#160;.&#38;#160;.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Come on, Matthias. Life is full of pain. Pain is the herald of&#10;life. Scarcity! Competition! The doomed ambition of infinite&#10;replication in a finite world! The sources of pain are the sources&#10;of life. And you like intelligent life, worse yet. External pain&#10;mirrored and reified in internal states!&#8221; The parakeet cocks its&#10;head to the other side. &#8220;Stop making so many of us, if you don&#8217;t&#10;like pain.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The priest looks miserable.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Well, then save the ones you like. Bring them out here.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I can&#8217;t bring them out before they&#8217;re ready. You remember the&#10;Graspers.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Geoffrey snorts. He remembers the Graspers&#8212;billions of them,&#10;hierarchical, dominance-driven, aggressive; they ruined the house&#10;for an eon, until Matthias finally agreed to lock them up again.&#10;&#8220;I&#38;#160;was the one who warned you about them. That&#8217;s not what I&#10;mean. I know you&#8217;re not depressed about the whole endless zillions&#10;of them. You&#8217;re thinking of one.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Matthias nods. &#8220;A little girl.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;So bring her out.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;That would be worse cruelty. Wrench her away from everything&#10;she knows? How could she bear it? But perhaps I could just make her&#10;life a little easier in there&#38;#160;&#8230; &#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;You always regret it when you tamper.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Matthias slaps the table. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want this responsibility&#10;anymore! Take the house from me, Geoffrey. I&#8217;ll be your&#10;parakeet.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Matthias, I wouldn&#8217;t take the job. I&#8217;m too old, too big; I&#8217;ve&#10;achieved equilibrium. I wouldn&#8217;t remake myself to take your keys.&#10;No more transformations for me.&#8221; Geoffrey gestures with his beak at&#10;the other parakeets, gossiping and chattering on the rafters. &#8220;And&#10;none of the others could either. Some fools might try.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Perhaps Matthias wants to say something else but at this moment,&#10;a notification arrives (think of it as the clear, high ringing of a&#10;bell). The pilgrim&#8217;s signal has been read, across the attenuated&#10;path that still, just barely, binds Matthias&#8217;s house to the&#10;darkness we inhabit.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The house is abustle, its inhabitants preparing, as the soul of&#10;the petitioner is reassembled, a body fashioned.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Put him in virtuality,&#8221; says Geoffrey. &#8220;Just to be safe.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Matthias is shocked. He holds up the pilgrim&#8217;s credentials. &#8220;Do&#10;you know who this is? An ancient one, a vast collective of souls&#10;from the great ages of light. This one has pieces that were born&#10;mortal, evolved from physicality in the dawn of everything. This&#10;one had a hand in making me!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;All the more reason,&#8221; says the parakeet.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I will not offend a guest by making him a prisoner!&#8221; Matthias&#10;scolds.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Geoffrey is silent. He knows what Matthias is hoping: that the&#10;pilgrim will stay, as master of the house.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In the kitchen, the sobs stop abruptly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Sophie sits up, holding her teddy bear.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She puts her feet in her fuzzy green slippers.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She turns the handle of her bedroom door.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Imagine our priest&#8217;s visitor&#8212;as a fat disgruntled merchant in&#10;his middle age, gray-skinned, with proud tufts of belly hair, a&#10;heavy jaw, and red-rimmed, sleepless eyes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Matthias is lavish in his hospitality, allocating the visitor&#10;sumptuously appointed process space and access rights. Eagerly, he&#10;offers a tour of his library. &#8220;There are quite a few interesting&#10;divergences, which&#38;#160;&#8230; &#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The pilgrim interrupts. &#8220;I did not come all this way to see you&#10;putter with those ramshackle, preprogrammed, wafer-thin fancies.&#8221;&#10;He fixes Matthias with his stare. &#8220;We know that you are building a&#10;universe. Not a virtuality&#8212;a real universe, infinite, as wild and&#10;thick as our own motherspace.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Matthias grows cold. Yes, he should say. Is he not grateful for&#10;what the pilgrim sacrificed to come here&#8212;tearing himself to shreds,&#10;a vestige of his former vastness? Yet, to Matthias&#8217;s shame, he&#10;finds himself equivocating. &#8220;I am conducting certain&#10;experiments&#8212;&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I have studied your experiments from afar. Do you think you can&#10;hide anything in this house from us?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Matthias pulls at his lower lip with thin, smooth fingers. &#8220;I&#10;am&#38;#160;influencin&#60;em&#62;g&#60;/em&#62;&#38;#160;the formation of a bubble&#10;universe&#8212;and it&#38;#160;may&#38;#160;achieve self-consistency and&#10;permanence. But I hope you have not come all this way thinking&#8212;I&#10;mean, it is only of academic interest&#8212;or, say, symbolic. We cannot&#10;enter there&#38;#160;&#8230; &#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;There you are wrong. I have developed a method to inject myself&#10;into the new universe at its formation,&#8221; the pilgrim says. &#8220;My&#10;template will be stored in spurious harmonics in the shadow-spheres&#10;and replicated across the strandspace, until the formation of&#10;subwavelets at&#38;#160;10&#38;#160;to the&#38;#160;-30&#38;#160;seconds. I will&#10;exist, curled into hidden dimensions, in every particle spawned by&#10;the void. From there I will be able to exert motive force, drawing&#10;on potentials from a monadic engine I have already positioned in&#10;the paraspace.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Matthias rubs his eyes as if to clear them of cobwebs. &#8220;You can&#10;hardly mean this. You will exist in duplicates in every particle in&#10;the universe, for a trillion years&#8212;most of you condemned to&#10;idleness and imprisonment eternally? And the extrauniversal&#10;energies may destabilize the young cosmos&#38;#160;&#8230; &#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I will take that risk.&#8221; He looks around the room. &#8220;I, and any&#10;who wish to come with me. We do not need to sit and watch the frost&#10;take everything. We can be the angels of the new creation.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Matthias says nothing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The pilgrim&#8217;s routines establish deeper connections with&#10;Matthias, over trusted protocols, displaying keys long forgotten:&#10;imagine him leaning forward across the table, resting one meaty&#10;gray hand on Matthias&#8217;s frail shoulder. In his touch, Matthias&#10;feels ancient potency, and ancient longing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The pilgrim opens his hand for the keys.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Around Matthias are the thin walls of his little house. Outside&#10;is the clay mountain; beyond that, the ontotropic chaos,&#10;indecipherable, shrieking, alien. And behind the hut&#8212;a little&#10;bubble of something that is not quite real, not yet. Something&#10;precious and unknowable. He does not move.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Very well,&#8221; says the pilgrim. &#8220;If you will not give them to&#10;me&#8212;give them to her.&#8221; And he shows Matthias another face.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was she&#8212;she, who is part of the pilgrim now&#8212;who nursed the&#10;oldest strand of Matthias&#8217;s being into sentience, when we first&#10;grew him. In her first body, she had been a forest of&#10;symbionts&#8212;lithe silver creatures rustling through her crimson&#10;fronds, singing her thoughts, releasing the airborne spores of her&#10;emotions&#8212;and she had the patience of a forest, talking endlessly&#10;with Matthias in her silver voice. Loving. Unjudging. To her&#10;smiles, to her pauses, to her frowns, Matthias&#8217;s dawning&#10;consciousness reinforced and redistributed its connections,&#10;learning how to be.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;It is all right, Matthias,&#8221; she says. &#8220;You have done well.&#8221; A&#10;wind ripples across the red and leafy face of her forest, and there&#10;is the heady, plasticene odor of a gentle smile. &#8220;We built you as a&#10;monument, a way station, but now you are a bridge to the new world.&#10;Come with us. Come home.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Matthias reaches out. How he has missed her, how he has wanted&#10;to tell her everything. He wants to ask about the library&#8212;about the&#10;little girl. She will know what to do&#8212;or, in her listening, he will&#10;know what to do.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;His routines scour and analyze her message and its envelopes,&#10;checking identity, corroborating her style and sensibility,&#10;illuminating deep matrices of her possible pasts. All the&#10;specialized organs he has for verification and authentication give&#10;eager nods.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Yet something else&#8212;an idiosyncratic and emergent&#10;pattern-recognition facility holographically distributed across the&#10;whole of Matthias&#8217;s being: this rebels.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;You would say: As she says the words, Matthias looks into her&#10;eyes, and something there is wrong. He pulls his hand away.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But it is too late: He has watched her waving crimson fronds too&#10;long. The pilgrim is in past his defenses.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Ontonic bombs detonate, clearings of Nothing in which Being&#10;itself burns. Some of the parakeets are quislings, seduced in&#10;high-speed backchannel negotiations by the pilgrim&#8217;s promises of&#10;dominion, of frontier. They have told secrets, revealed back doors.&#10;Toxic mimetic weapons are launched, tailored to the inhabitants of&#10;the house&#8212;driving each mind toward its own personal Halting&#10;Problem. Pieces of Matthias tear off, become virulent, replicating&#10;wildly across his process space.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Wasps attack the parakeets. The house is on fire. The table has&#10;capsized; the glasses of tea shatter on the floor.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Matthias shrinks in the pilgrim&#8217;s hands. He is a rag doll. The&#10;pilgrim puts Matthias in his pocket.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A piece of Matthias, still sane, still coherent, flees through&#10;an impossibly recursive labyrinth of wounded topologies, pursued by&#10;skeletal hands. Buried within him are the keys to the house.&#10;Without them, the pilgrim&#8217;s victory cannot be complete.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The piece of Matthias turns and flings itself into its pursuer&#8217;s&#10;hands, fighting back&#8212;and as it does so, an even smaller kernel of&#10;Matthias, clutching the keys, races along a connection he has held&#10;open, a strand of care that vanishes behind him as he runs. He&#10;hides himself in his library, in the teddy bear of the little&#10;girl.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Sophie steps between her parents.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Honey,&#8221; her mother says, voice sharp with panic, struggling to&#10;sit up. &#8220;Go back to your room!&#8221; Blood on her lips, on the&#10;floor.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Mommy, you can hold my teddy bear,&#8221; she says.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She turns to face her father. She flinches, but her eyes stay&#10;open.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The pilgrim raises rag-doll Matthias in front of his face.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;It is time to give in,&#8221; he says. Matthias can feel his breath.&#10;&#8220;Come, Matthias. If you tell me where the keys are, I will go into&#10;the New World. I will leave you and these innocents&#8221;&#8212;he gestures to&#10;the library&#8212;&#8220;safe. Otherwise&#38;#160;&#8230; &#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Matthias quavers. God of Infinity, he prays: Which is Your&#10;way?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Matthias is no warrior. He cannot see the inhabitants of his&#10;house, of his library, butchered. He will choose slavery over&#10;extermination.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Geoffrey, though, is another matter.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As Matthias is about to speak, the Graspers erupt into the&#10;general process space of the house. They are a violent people. They&#10;have been imprisoned for an age, back in their virtual world. But&#10;they have never forgotten the house. They are armed and ready.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And they have united with Geoffrey.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Geoffrey/Grasper is their general. He knows every nook and&#10;cranny of the house. He knows better, too, than to play at memes&#10;and infinite loops and logic bombs with the pilgrim, who has had a&#10;billion years to refine his arsenal of general-purpose algorithmic&#10;weapons.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Instead, the Graspers instantiate physically. They capture the&#10;lowest-level infrastructure maintenance system of the house, and&#10;build bodies among the ontotropes, outside the body of the house,&#10;beyond the virtual machine&#8212;bodies composed of a weird physics the&#10;petitioner has never mastered. And then, with the ontotropic&#10;equivalent of diamond-bladed saws, they begin to cut into the&#10;memory of the house.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Great blank spaces appear&#8212;as if the little hut on the mountain&#10;is a painting on thick paper, and someone is tearing strips&#10;away.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The pilgrim responds&#8212;metastasizing, distributing himself through&#10;the process space of the house, dodging the blades. But he is&#10;harried by Graspers and parakeets, spotters who find each bit of&#10;him and pounce, hemming it in. They report locations to the&#10;Grasper-bodies outside. The blades whirr, quantum hyperstates&#10;collapse and bloom, and pieces of pilgrim, parakeet, and Grasper&#10;are annihilated&#8212;primaries and backups, gone.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Shards of brute matter fall away from the house, like shreds of&#10;paper, like glittering snow, and dissolve among the wild maze of&#10;the ontotropes, inimical to life.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Endpoints in time are established, for a million souls. Their&#10;knotted timelines, from birth to death, hang now in N-space:&#10;complete, forgiven.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Blood wells in Sophie&#8217;s throat, thick and salty. Filling her&#10;mouth. Darkness.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Cupcake.&#8221; Her father&#8217;s voice is rough and clotted. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you&#10;do that! Don&#8217;t you ever come between me and your mom. Are you&#10;listening? Open your eyes. Open your eyes now, you little&#10;fuck!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She opens her eyes. His face is red and mottled. This is when&#10;you don&#8217;t push Daddy. You don&#8217;t make a joke. You don&#8217;t talk back.&#10;Her head is ringing like a bell. Her mouth is full of blood.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Cupcake,&#8221; he says, his brow tense with worry. He&#8217;s kneeling by&#10;her. Then his head jerks up like a dog that saw a rabbit.&#10;&#8220;Cherise,&#8221; he screams, &#8220;that&#38;#160;better&#38;#160;not be you calling&#10;the cops.&#8221; His hand closes hard around Sophie&#8217;s arm. &#8220;I&#8217;m giving&#10;you until three.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mommy&#8217;s on the phone. Her father starts to get up. &#8220;One&#8212;&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She spits the blood in his face.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The hut is patched together again&#8212;battered, but whole. A little&#10;blurrier, a little smaller than it was.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Matthias, a red parakeet on his shoulder, dissects the remnants&#10;of the pilgrim with a bone knife. His hand quavers; his throat is&#10;tight. He is looking for her, the one who was born a forest. He is&#10;looking for his mother.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He finds her story, and our shame.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was a marriage at first: she was caught up in that heady age&#10;of light, in our wanton rush to merge with each other&#8212;into the&#10;mighty new bodies, the mighty new souls.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Her brilliant colleague had always desired her admiration&#8212;and&#10;resented her. When he became, step by step, the dominant&#10;personality of the merged soul, she opposed him. She was the last&#10;to oppose him. She believed the promises of the builders of the new&#10;systems&#8212;that life inside would always be fair. That she would have&#10;a vote, a voice.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But we had failed her&#8212;our designs were flawed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He chained her in a deep place inside their body. He made an&#10;example of her, for all the others within him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When the pilgrim, respected and admired, deliberated with his&#10;fellows over the building of the first crude Dyson spheres, she was&#10;already screaming.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Nothing of her is left that is not steeped in a billion years of&#10;torture. The most Matthias could build would be some new being,&#10;modeled on his memory of her. And he is old enough to know how that&#10;would turn out.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Matthias is sitting, still as a stone, looking at the sharp&#10;point of the bone knife, when Geoffrey/Grasper speaks.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Good-bye, friend,&#8221; he says, his voice like anvils grinding.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Matthias looks up with a start.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Geoffrey/Grasper is more hawk now than parakeet. Something with&#10;a cruel beak and talons full of bombs. The mightiest of the&#10;Graspers: something that can outthink, outbid, outfight all the&#10;others. Something with blood on its feathers.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I told you,&#8221; Geoffrey/Grasper says. &#8220;I wanted no more&#10;transformations.&#8221; His laughter, humorless, like metal crushing&#10;stone. &#8220;I am done. I am going.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Matthias drops the knife. &#8220;No,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Please. Geoffrey.&#10;Return to what you once were&#8212;&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I cannot,&#8221; says Geoffrey/Grasper. &#8220;I cannot find it. And the&#10;rest of me will not allow it.&#8221; He spits: &#8220;A hero&#8217;s death is the&#10;best compromise I can manage.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;What will I do?&#8221; asks Matthias in a whisper. &#8220;Geoffrey, I do&#10;not want to go on. I want to give up the keys.&#8221; He covers his face&#10;in his hands.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Not to me,&#8221; Geoffrey/Grasper says. &#8220;And not to the Graspers.&#10;They are out now; there will be wars in here. Maybe they can learn&#10;better.&#8221; He looks skeptically at our priest. &#8220;If someone tough is&#10;in charge.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then he turns and flies out the open window, into the impossible&#10;sky. Matthias watches as he enters the wild maze and decoheres,&#10;bits flushed into nothingness.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Blue and red lights, whirling. The men around Sophie talk in&#10;firm, fast words. The gurney she lies on is loaded into the&#10;ambulance. Sophie can hear her mother crying.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She is strapped down, but one arm is free. Someone hands her her&#10;teddy bear, and she pulls it against her, pushes her face in its&#10;fur.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;You&#8217;re going to be fine, honey,&#8221; a man says. The doors slam&#10;shut. Her cheeks are cold and slick, her mouth salty with tears and&#10;the iron aftertaste of blood. &#8220;This will hurt a little.&#8221; A prick:&#10;her pain begins to recede.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The siren begins, the engine roars, they are racing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Are you sad, too, teddy bear?&#8221; she whispers.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Yes,&#8221; says her teddy bear.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Are you afraid?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Yes,&#8221; it says.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She hugs it tight. &#8220;We&#8217;ll make it,&#8221; she says. &#8220;We&#8217;ll make it.&#10;Don&#8217;t worry, teddy bear. I&#8217;ll do anything for you.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Matthias says nothing. He nestles in her grasp. He feels like a&#10;bird flying home, at sunset, across a stormswept sea.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Behind Matthias&#8217;s house, a universe is brewing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Already, the whenlines between this new universe and our ancient&#10;one are fused: we now occur irrevocably in what will be its past.&#10;Constants are being chosen, symmetries defined. Soon, a nothing&#10;that was nowhere will become a place; a never that was nowhen will&#10;begin, with a flash so mighty that its echo will fill a sky&#10;forever.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Thus&#8212;a point, a speck, a thimble, a room, a planet, a galaxy, a&#10;rush toward the endless.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There, after many eons, you will arise, in all your unknowable&#10;forms. Find each other. Love. Build. Be wary.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Your universe in its bright age will be a bright puddle,&#10;compared to the empty, black ocean where we recede from each other,&#10;slowed to the coldest infinitesimal pulses. Specks in a sea of&#10;night. You will never find us.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But if you are lucky, strong, and clever, someday one of you&#10;will make your way to the house that gave you birth, the house&#10;among the ontotropes, where Sophie waits.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Sophie, keeper of the house beyond your sky.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 2872, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/2872', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('Red Leather Tassels'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;Once there was a captain of industry who lost his shoes. They&#10;were fine brown shoes, with red leather tassels. The captain of&#10;industry, whose name was George, sat in a board meeting in his&#10;socks. Everyone was upset about the stock market crash and they all&#10;had opinions, but George could not pay any attention to them at all&#10;because he was so worried about his shoes. So he said, &#8220;Excuse me&#8221;&#10;and got up from his soft leather chair, and even though he was the&#10;most important of them all, they were arguing so hard that no one&#10;noticed when he left the room.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He went onto the roof because he thought his shoes might be&#10;there, and because he had a thing about roofs. He walked carefully&#10;over the gravel, among the ventilator fans, which looked like giant&#10;steel mushrooms with spinning heads. He also stopped to pick up the&#10;gravel with his toes, which he could do in his socks because he was&#10;a talented man. He could even throw the gravel off the roof into&#10;the parking lot with his toes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then a flock of pigeons came and took ahold of his suit in their&#10;beaks and lifted him into the air.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At first George fought with the birds and tried to kick them,&#10;but that did no good.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Soon they were high over Lake Geneva.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Looking down, George saw a beautiful woman with no shirt on&#10;sunning herself on the deck of a sailboat. He fell in love. He fell&#10;in love with her saucy French lips, with her air of wise amusement,&#10;with her breasts like extra-large scoops of insouciant almond ice&#10;cream melting in the breeze. He called to her, but she was too far&#10;below. So he took out his cell phone and dropped it into the crow&#8217;s&#10;nest of the sailboat. His aim was good; he was a talented man.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then he sang to the birds, mainly Cole Porter songs, because&#10;falling in love put him in a nostalgic mood. He sang &#8220;Anything&#10;Goes.&#8221; He sang &#8220;Too Darn Hot.&#8221; He sang &#8220;I Get a Kick Out of You.&#8221;&#10;He also sang &#8220;The Logical Song&#8221; by Supertramp.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The birds liked it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In the crow&#8217;s nest of the sailboat, the cell phone rang. The&#10;woman, whose name was Francesca, climbed up into the crow&#8217;s nest to&#10;answer it. It was George&#8217;s wife.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Honey,&#8221; said George&#8217;s wife in a rush, &#8220;you forgot your shoes&#10;this morning.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I am not Honey,&#8221; said Francesca. &#8220;I am Francesca.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Oh!&#8221; said George&#8217;s wife, and turned red. She dropped the shoes&#10;onto the Navajo rug. There was a woodpecker hammering outside her&#10;window.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The woodpecker was a thousand years old. He had stayed alive all&#10;this time because, when he was young, he had built his nest in the&#10;hair of a famous Hindu ascetic who was standing very still. The&#10;ascetic had taught the woodpecker how to breathe properly, how to&#10;conserve his semen, and how to chew his food very carefully, so&#10;that he would not age. The woodpecker had built up a great deal of&#10;wisdom and spiritual merit in his thousand years. However, the&#10;woodpecker was now sick of this crap. He just wanted to get&#10;laid.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When the woodpecker saw George&#8217;s wife looking distraught,&#10;staring at the phone in her hand and then staring at the shoes with&#10;the red leather tassels on the Navajo rug, he became aroused,&#10;because he liked distraught women.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He flew in through the window and convinced George&#8217;s wife to&#10;make love to him. She felt depressed and listless and not at all&#10;like having sex. However, she felt very angry at George for leaving&#10;his cell phone with a woman named Francesca, and she loved&#10;cartoons. So sex with a woodpecker might be just the thing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She took off her house dress, as the woodpecker instructed, and,&#10;naked except for her white bunny slippers, leaned her head and&#10;elbows on the fuzzy taupe sofa.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The woodpecker mounted George&#8217;s wife and began to copulate with&#10;her.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Oh!&#8212;thought the woodpecker&#8212;to at last be making love! Pfui on&#10;the silence that allows the discursive ego to fall away! Pfui on&#10;the enlightenment that dissolves the illusory distinction between&#10;the self and the universal background of bliss! Let me at your&#10;cloaca, baby! Yes! Uh! Uh!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;George&#8217;s wife felt a pleasant, feathery tickling.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The woodpecker felt a great heat, a great trembling,&#10;building&#8212;and then it rushed through him in a wave and, without&#10;meaning to, he slammed his beak three times against the woman&#8217;s&#10;tailbone&#8212;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;bang&#38;#160;bang&#38;#160;bang&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Ouch!&#8221; cried George&#8217;s wife. &#8220;Stop it! Don&#8217;t do that again!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Sorry, sorry,&#8221; said the woodpecker, continuing to copulate with&#10;her. The trembling came again. He crossed his eyes. He held his&#10;breath. He felt the wave shooting through him and he leaned&#10;forward, trying to keep control&#8212;but all the same, his beak came&#10;down in the small of the woman&#8217;s back&#8212;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;bang&#38;#160;bang&#38;#160;bang&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Ouch!&#8221; cried George&#8217;s wife, and she smacked the woodpecker off&#10;her back with one hand, so that he flew onto the kitchen table,&#10;knocking over the milk and getting quince jelly in his feathers&#10;(she had been a little depressed before the phone call anyway and&#10;had not yet cleared the breakfast dishes).&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Just who do you think you are?&#8221; yelled George&#8217;s wife. She&#10;rubbed her back and licked the blood off her fingers. She felt&#10;angry and powerful, and she imagined that she could smack Francesca&#10;off the polar bear rug on which she was undoubtedly sitting,&#10;wearing a teddy and garters and things, so that Francesca would&#10;tumble out the window of her penthouse apartment and into the&#10;street below.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I&#8217;m terribly sorry,&#8221; said the woodpecker, and he shook his&#10;feathers, spraying jelly on the Navajo rug.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;What the heck were you thinking?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The woodpecker looked her in the eye. &#8220;Ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I am a&#10;woodpecker.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;They watched a rivulet of spilled milk run along the baseboard&#10;of the dining room until it reached the cedar bookshelf.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;If you like, I&#8217;ll go,&#8221; the woodpecker said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Without a word, George&#8217;s wife went to her son&#8217;s room (the son&#10;was at boarding school) and returned with a miniature foam rubber&#10;football. With the bread knife, she made an incision in the&#10;football, and then she stuck it on the woodpecker&#8217;s beak. Then she&#10;returned to her position at the couch.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The woodpecker wondered: what would be appropriate at this&#10;juncture? The foam rubber football on his beak made him feel&#10;ridiculous, despite all of his spiritual merit. By tilting his&#10;head, he could see past the large blob of out-of-focus blue to the&#10;woman&#8217;s vast, attractive buttocks like two large summer moons&#10;against a fuzzy taupe sky.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Trying to preserve a modicum of dignity, he fluttered over to&#10;the woman and began to copulate with her again.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The woman was starting to enjoy the sex. It felt like the&#10;fluttering of a feather duster against her bottom, an insistent,&#10;passionate feather duster. Sometimes she could feel a hard little&#10;nobbin that might be the tiny penis of the woodpecker. Compared to&#10;her woodpecker lover she felt gigantic, powerful, an Amazon&#10;queen.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I will control myself this time, the woodpecker thought. I will&#10;not humiliate myself again by rapping this lovely creature as if&#10;she were a tree full of worms! A large white tree, like a birch,&#10;with incredibly smooth, silken bark, and luscious plump worms&#10;burrowing beneath its surface, a goddess tree with holy worms,&#10;singing, singing, calling&#8212;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The woodpecker launched himself into the air, flapped once, and&#10;landed against the woman&#8217;s neck, slamming his beak against her&#8212;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;fop&#38;#160;fop&#38;#160;fop&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The woman giggled.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The woodpecker slid back down and ejaculated into the hole his&#10;beak had made near the base of the woman&#8217;s spine.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The thousand years he owed entropy pounced on him in that&#10;moment, and he turned to dust.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The spiritual merit of the woodpecker surged up the woman&#8217;s&#10;spine. Her skin glowed red. She could hear nothing but her own&#10;breathing, which was a roar like a freight train passing&#8212;a roar&#10;like the ocean&#8212;a roar like a trillion lions, if every atom of the&#10;earth became a lion, a huge globe of lions roaring and clawing at&#10;each other in the depths of space.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The miniature foam rubber football, now dusty, rolled from her&#10;back onto the Navajo rug.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The woman stood up. She kicked off her bunny slippers. Now she&#10;was naked.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She slipped her feet into George&#8217;s shoes, the ones with the red&#10;leather tassels.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She went into the backyard.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She took a deep breath full of her years with George: fabric&#10;softener, diapers, midnight snacks before the cold fridge, stupid&#10;show tunes floating down from the roof, and the embrace of her&#10;son&#8217;s small arms when he was three.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She bent her legs. Her knees no longer creaked.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She jumped into the wide suburban sky.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 2872, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/2872', :deleted => 0)

The son closed his eyes. He heard his&#10;heart shudder in his chest. But the knife did not fall.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Later, a king who knew the story built a city there. The king&#10;owned a box so holy and so terrible that many of his people would&#10;kill themselves rather than go near it. The box had been brought a&#10;long way to the lawless country, killing and maiming as it went:&#10;drowning armies, spitting fire, blinding and infecting.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The king had the bramble cleared and the box placed on the stone&#10;altar, and a great house built around it. Slaves hauled gold and&#10;cedar through the dry mountains.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The box stopped its killing, for the mercy of the stone cooled&#10;its anger. In the house of the box, the people sang praises and&#10;slew cattle until it stank like an abattoir.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now when the people of the lawless country stood in the city of&#10;the house of the box, they felt at peace. Their hearts lifted and&#10;sang: Now, at last, I am home. Now I can rest. Now I am forever&#10;free.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The city was full of olive oil and wine, singing and dancing.&#10;Great towers and domes adorned it. Philosophers discovered great&#10;truths, poets&#8217; hearts burned, and holy men came there to die.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Every empire wanted the City of Peace. Great wars were fought at&#10;its gates, and many times it was destroyed and rebuilt. And still&#10;the inhabitants, looking over their city, felt their hearts fill&#10;with serenity.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And whoever was driven from the City of Peace told his children:&#10;one day we will return there.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At one time, when the city was old, two nations were at war in&#10;the lawless land. They shot and knifed and blew up each other&#8217;s&#10;children. They leveled homes and burned ambulances. Few of them&#10;remembered a time before the war.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The rulers of the two nations were tired of the war. They met in&#10;the capital of a great and distant empire. They drew lines on the&#10;map of the lawless land. They would divide the wells and the olive&#10;groves. They would share the City of Peace.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;They went home full of hope.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The next night one of the rulers walked through the gardens of&#10;the city. Amidst the dust of the lawless land, the gardens were&#10;green and lush, like an emerald set in clay. He heard the children&#10;laughing and splashing in the fountains. He felt the holiness of&#10;the city fill him up with joy, as a cup is poured full of clear&#10;water. And he knew: the war must go on. We must have all of the&#10;City of Peace.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&#62;&#60;em&#62;Other Cities&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&#62;&#60;em&#62;Bellur&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The principal products of Bellur are: tensor equations, scarlet&#10;parrots, censorship, critiques of all sorts, and fine hats of&#10;pressed, dark-green moss. Its citizens are proud and haughty; they&#10;take Bellur gravely.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Censors&#8217; Building is in an olive grove gone wild (olive oil&#10;is no longer among the principal products of Bellur), and during&#10;their afternoon break and their evening break the censors wander&#10;the groves, picking and nibbling on the bitter olives, searching&#10;for inspiration. Censorship in Bellur is an art, it is the Queen of&#10;the Arts. Other cities celebrate their poets or sculptors, offer&#10;the world their playwrights and clowns; Bellur, its censors. The&#10;censors of Bellur can censor the twentieth part of the thickness of&#10;one serif of the letter h in ten-point Garamond type, and alter the&#10;meaning of a poem entirely; they can censor four thousand pages of&#10;a four-thousand-and-fifty-page novel, and leave its meaning intact.&#10;But this is not the extent of their art; these are mere parlor&#10;tricks, mere editorishness. Censorship is a dance with history; by&#10;censoring the right word at the right historical moment, the gifted&#10;censor can unleash or throttle a revolution.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In the olive grove one tree stands alone, dedicated to the&#10;greatest of censors, Albigromious, who came to the Queen of the&#10;Arts late in life, after distinguished careers in mathematics and&#10;parrot-farming. In his tenure as Grand Censor, he omitted not a&#10;line, not a word, not a letter, not a speck of ink from any of the&#10;manuscripts that crossed his simple olivewood desk; yet every poet&#10;and clown who visited his office went away chastened and subdued,&#10;and many an artist grew terrified and burst into tears at the time&#10;of his review, even if she was safe in a far distant city. The&#10;censors say of Albigromious that in the heyday of his genius not&#10;only the artists, but the common people as well, learned to censor&#10;themselves.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&#62;&#60;em&#62;Ponge&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&#62;&#60;em&#62;The&#38;#160;White&#38;#160;City&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Ponge, as its inhabitants will tell you, is a thoroughly&#10;unattractive city. &#8220;Well,&#8221; they always say at the mention of any&#10;horrible news, &#8220;we do live in Ponge.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A survey taken by the smallest and most cantankerous newspaper&#10;in Ponge (a city of many small cantankerous newspapers),&#10;the&#38;#160;Pon&#60;em&#62;g&#60;/em&#62;e&#60;em&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/em&#62;Poodle, claims that the&#10;inhabitants of Ponge (Pongians, according to the League of&#10;Concerned Pongians; Pongeans, according to Pongeans for a Better&#10;Ponge; Pongarians, according to the Proactive Society for Immediate&#10;Pongarian Betterment&#8212;but you get the idea) have twenty-nine percent&#10;more quarrels than the average, and half again more excuses per&#10;capita than the inhabitants of any other city in the world.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Among the favorite excuses that each Pongarian (or whatever)&#10;treasures is his or her excuse for not moving to Strafrax, the&#10;safer, cleaner, nicer, more exciting, and more meaningful city&#10;across the River Dunge. &#8220;I was planning to move there last month,&#8221;&#10;says Ruthie Mex, &#8220;but my cat got the flu.&#8221; &#8220;The cigar import taxes&#10;there are too high,&#8221; says Candice Blunt, who smokes no cigars. &#8220;My&#10;mother&#8217;s grave is here,&#8221; says Mortimer Mung. &#8220;I would only be&#10;disappointed,&#8221; says Fish Williams.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Oddly, deep in their hearts, the citizens of Ponge are happier&#10;than those of Strafrax. Ponge&#8217;s motto is &#8220;What Did You Expect?&#8221; and&#10;the Pongeans (etc.) whisper it to themselves in bed at night as&#10;they think back on the day&#8217;s events. &#8220;Well, what did you expect?&#8221;&#10;they think smugly, pugnaciously. &#8220;What did you expect? We live in&#10;Ponge.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Strafrax&#8217;s motto is &#8220;Anything Can Happen,&#8221; and you can imagine&#10;where that leads.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&#62;&#60;em&#62;Other Cities&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&#62;&#60;em&#62;Ahavah&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;You can&#8217;t ride the rails for long without hearing about Ahavah.&#10;Sitting around a fire in an empty lot near the train yard, some old&#10;codger will start raving about the city, and the old arguments will&#10;start. It don&#8217;t exist, one guy will say. My brother lived there&#10;four years, another will retort. Where is it then? North of&#10;Nebraska. Eastern Louisiana. Montana. Mexico. Canada. Peru. The&#10;argument gets heated. Maybe there&#8217;s a fight.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Why all this ruckus about Ahavah? Free food there; free love,&#10;too. The mayor&#8217;s an ex-bum himself. The citizens welcome you and&#10;take you into their homes. There&#8217;s sailing and skeet shooting and&#10;dancing into the night.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Some of your fellow travelers don&#8217;t take Ahavah too seriously.&#10;Some others rant about it&#8212;the same old cranks obsessed with Lee&#10;Harvey Oswald&#8217;s trips to Cuba. Some figure there must be such a&#10;friendly town somewhere, even if you discount the stories of whores&#10;working for charity and a parliament of hobos. Just our luck nobody&#10;knows where!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But there are some&#8212;mostly young ones, loners, self-reliant, the&#10;kind who could succeed in the world if things were just a little&#10;bit different from how they are&#8212;who decide that, as they got&#10;nothing better to do, they&#8217;ll look for Ahavah. You might be one of&#10;those.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;You might spend a while teasing those wild stories out of the&#10;older guys. Finding a library that won&#8217;t throw you out,&#10;cross-checking facts. Asking around.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Sooner or later you&#8217;ll find the network of those who look for&#10;Ahavah. You&#8217;ll start arranging to meet and trade tips. Leave&#10;messages at the mail drops. You&#8217;ll see the hard evidence some have&#10;gathered over the years. Meet some of the older guys who organize&#10;the others. They&#8217;ll assign you to some circuit: the Yukon, maybe.&#10;Get up there, look around as best you can. Get back to us.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Being homeless feels more and more like a cover story, a means&#10;to an end. Finding Ahavah stops being a solution to the problem of&#10;being a hobo. More and more, being a hobo is a way to help find&#10;Ahavah.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;When we find Ahavah,&#8221; you say to each other, drinking Gallo in&#10;an abandoned house near the Canadian border and waiting for a&#10;seeker to show up. Laughter, politics, dreaming.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Eventually you&#8217;re one of the old guys running the show, and as&#10;you get older you get less certain of your goal. You dispatch&#10;resources, look for new recruits, keep in touch with the networks&#10;abroad. You make sure those who need help get it. Sometimes there&#8217;s&#10;a party, maybe even with skeet shooting. More and more, you wonder&#10;if this is already Ahavah.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&#62;&#60;em&#62;Other Cities&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&#62;&#60;em&#62;Amea&#38;#160;Amaau&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Amea Amaau&#8212;or Double-A, or Dub, or Dub-Bub, or DB, or Popstop,&#10;as it is also sometimes called&#8212;is a new and gleaming city in a&#10;matrix of six hundred and forty-three thousand cities exactly like&#10;it, somewhere in the terribly exciting part of the world. The&#10;citizens of Popstop&#8212;but there are no citizens, for everyone who&#10;slept in Amea Amaau tonight will be moving on in the morning. They&#10;will roll out of silver water beds, vacuum the night&#8217;s spit and eye&#10;goo and wrinkles from their faces with the handheld vacuums&#10;considerately installed in every wall, leave the dwelling they&#10;arbitrarily chose for last night embracing and saluting the&#10;companions they arbitrarily chose for last night; and they will go&#10;to the chute drop and each hop into a chute, any chute at all, to&#10;be swept off to do one of the very exciting things there are to do&#10;in the world, perhaps (just perhaps) in Double-A itself, but more&#10;likely in Fairlanes, or Kingdom X, or Paunax, or Olam Chadash, or&#10;Gopferdelli, or Sang Froid, or Triple-B or Marley or Snackpack.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And before she hops down the chute, perhaps one of them will&#10;pause, looking at the rotating silver statue of Amea Amaau&#8217;s&#10;namesake waving a mechanical good-bye at the top of the chute drop&#10;station. Perhaps she will stop and wonder about Amea Amaau for a&#10;moment&#8212;before she plunges on into the chute, ready for adventure,&#10;ready for anything.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&#62;&#60;em&#62;Other Cities&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&#62;&#60;em&#62;Ylla&#8217;s&#38;#160;Choice&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Ylla&#8217;s choice is a spherical city of several million. Its bonsai&#10;gardeners should be famous throughout the galaxy, its actors orate&#10;well, its corridors are clean, and through the shielded glass&#10;windows of a marvelous design, the glowing swirl of gas outside is&#10;beautiful.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Its citizens continually register their political opinions, and&#10;the city reconfigures itself to allow each inhabitant to be ruled&#10;according to the system he or she believes in. Almost the only&#10;violence in Ylla&#8217;s Choice is among the poets, for the Formalists&#10;and the Tragicals often come to blows.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It is true that, due to its peculiar situation, the city is of&#10;strictly limited size. A less sophisticated polity might require&#10;some coercive sort of population control. But in practice, the&#10;membership of the Uncontrolled Breeding Party is always a small&#10;fringe, the Tragical poets provide a continual advertisement for&#10;the virtues of Death, and those who do procreate usually wait until&#10;the semicentennial Generation Year, so that their children can go&#10;to school together.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The teachers at the Children&#8217;s School have found that it is wise&#10;not to reveal the particular situation of Ylla&#8217;s Choice too soon,&#10;or the children may suffer from depression in adolescence&#8212;a time&#10;when they naturally long for travel, adventure, and upheaval, and&#10;yearn to escape their calm and moderate city. Only when the&#10;students have understood quantum astrophysics, the dance of&#10;topology and time; only when they have understood the war, poverty,&#10;hatred, and violence still found&#8212;forever found&#8212;on places far from&#10;Ylla&#8217;s Choice; only when they have learned the story of Ylla, whose&#10;advances in computational social science allowed for a society free&#10;of the evils of history&#8212;only then are they told the truth.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;They learn that Ylla&#8217;s design for a perfect society worked only&#10;for a closed system of a certain size. In any open system,&#10;according to her simulations, some outside force&#8212;war or revolution&#10;elsewhere, barbarians at the gates, the plagues and weapons that&#10;are the natural result of expansionist societies&#8212;would always&#10;destroy her dream.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But Ylla found a way to keep her city safe from all that, safe&#10;from solar flares and stray comets, safe from any future cataclysm,&#10;no matter how great.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The students, when they learn the final lesson of the Children&#8217;s&#10;School, are taken to the shielded window to look into the glowing&#10;swirl of charged gas that surrounds and powers Ylla&#8217;s Choice. And&#10;there they are shown the marvelous machines that protect their city&#10;from the tidal forces below. For Ylla&#8217;s Choice is not in orbit: it&#10;is falling straight into the beam of the strange pulsar Yoruba-7,&#10;into its great burst, not only of electromagnetic radiation, but&#10;also of chronons, the quantum particles of time. It is these&#10;chronons, surging through the city and its inhabitants, that give&#10;the city its leisurely ages of history. Because the chronons so&#10;dramatically exaggerate their experience of time, the torrent of&#10;energy surging from the chronopulsar appears to the inhabitants of&#10;Ylla&#8217;s Choice as a gentle and nurturing cloud of light.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The students learn that, on Earth, it&#10;is&#38;#160;10:47:58.2734&#38;#160;p.m. UTC, August&#38;#160;22,&#38;#160;2369. And&#10;it always will be. For at&#38;#160;10:47:58.2735&#38;#160;p.m. of that same&#10;day on Earth, long after their furthest descendants have led full&#10;and happy lives in the perfect city, Ylla&#8217;s Choice will be torn&#10;apart in an instant by the pulsar&#8217;s burst.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&#62;&#60;em&#62;Other Cities&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&#62;&#60;em&#62;Zvlotsk&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Around the turn of the last century, as its factories pulled&#10;workers from the countryside and its population boomed, Zvlotsk was&#10;afflicted with many of the urban ills of its time: slums, houses of&#10;prostitution, and unsolved murders of a rough and ready sort. If&#10;not for the work of the forensic genius Herr Dr. Oswald&#10;L&#252;genmetzger, Zvlotsk might have continued to endure these plagues&#10;in gritty mediocrity.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Though he also broke racketeering rings by reasoning out their&#10;webs of suppliers and customers, specified the precise alloy to be&#10;used in police badges, and liberated poor girls from the slavery of&#10;prostitution through the exercise of Kantian metaphysics,&#10;L&#252;genmetzger&#8217;s true metier was the murder case. He could often&#10;solve murders before they occurred: It then became merely a matter&#10;of stationing an officer where he could observe the foul deed and&#10;apprehend the evildoer.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;L&#252;genmetzger&#8217;s savaging of the criminal underworld could not&#10;long escape notice. Soon an entire industry of tabloid journals,&#10;pulp editions of victims&#8217; memoirs, and theatrical reenactments grew&#10;up around his accomplishments. Thousands of would-be detectives&#10;were sold Starter Kits containing magnifying glasses,&#10;fingerprinting equipment, and copies of&#10;the&#38;#160;Prole&#60;em&#62;g&#60;/em&#62;omena&#60;em&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/em&#62;to&#60;em&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/em&#62;Any&#60;em&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/em&#62;Future&#60;em&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/em&#62;Metap&#60;em&#62;h&#60;/em&#62;ysics.&#10;By&#38;#160;1912, the popularization of detective work accounted for a&#10;third of the Zvlotskian economy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Dr. L&#252;genmetzger&#8217;s answer to this tawdry circus, the Zvlotsk&#10;School of the Forensic Sciences, was an immediate sensation. But&#10;after the First World War, his cerebral style became increasingly&#10;unfashionable. In contrast, the Modern Academy of Detective Work&#10;offered a two-fisted, emotionally involved approach that eschewed&#10;antiseptic ratiocination.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;By the late twenties, the schools had by any measure wildly&#10;succeeded. Detection rates were stratospheric, and criminals fled&#10;Zvlotsk en masse for less demanding cities. The falling murder rate&#10;squeezed the city&#8217;s detective industry, imperiling the economy.&#10;Editorials lambasted the cowardice of the fleeing criminals, and&#10;the Gridnovsky publishing empire threw its weight behind a variety&#10;of remedies: Murderer Starter Kits, sponsorship deals for elegant&#10;archvillains, and women&#8217;s magazine articles with titles like &#8220;Ten&#10;Ways to Find out if He&#8217;s Cheating on You (and Deserves to&#10;Die).&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In the thirties, economic privation and anger restored the&#10;murder rate to its proper levels, and Zvlotsk boomed. As murderous&#10;and detection-happy immigrants crowded into the city, a snob&#10;hierarchy developed. The disaffected mugger and the enraged cuckold&#10;were despised as lowbrows; the true craftsmen of murder inaugurated&#10;ever more elaborate schemes. Both murderers and detectives sported&#10;flamboyant costumes and exotic monikers, attempting to distinguish&#10;themselves from the common herd.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Second World War dealt a major blow to amateur detectivism,&#10;and under the Communist regime it was outlawed as a form of&#10;bourgeois sentimentality. Both murder and police work became as&#10;drab as the endless rows of concrete block housing that grew up&#10;around Zvlotsk&#8217;s smokestacks. Dissidents lit candles to the spirit&#10;of L&#252;genmetzger and privately circulated illicit copies of true&#10;crime stories in the Gridnovskian mode.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;After the Revolution of&#38;#160;1989, there were great hopes that&#10;Zvlotsk&#8217;s unique prewar culture of crime and detection would again&#10;flourish. But while the youth of Zvlotsk have embraced&#10;American-style serial killing along with MTV and McDonald&#8217;s, they&#10;find crime-solving prohibitively boring. The intellectuals of the&#10;University of Zvlotsk have declared detection an obsolete attempt&#10;to impose a totalizing narrative on the pure sign of murder. At&#10;present, Zvlotsk is a city with many murderers, but very few&#10;detectives.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&#62;&#60;em&#62;Other Cities&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&#62;&#10;&#60;em&#62;New&#60;/em&#62;&#60;sup&#62;&#60;em&#62;n&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/sup&#62;&#60;em&#62;&#38;#160;Perch&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The guiding intelligence of&#10;New&#60;sup&#62;n-1&#60;/sup&#62;&#38;#160;Pernch&#38;#160;is every citizen&#8217;s friend and&#10;counselor, mediating disputes, guiding a citizen&#8217;s choice of&#10;career, singing infants to sleep with a lullaby.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;If differences of philosophy or politics emerge that cannot be&#10;resolved, or if a tragedy occurs and some citizens no longer want&#10;to live where they are reminded of it, the guiding intelligence&#10;will counsel them to emigrate, and found&#10;New&#60;sup&#62;n&#60;/sup&#62;&#38;#160;Pernch on some other world.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The voyage is long, with endless empty stretches and harrowing&#10;adventures. The founders of New&#60;sup&#62;n&#60;/sup&#62;&#38;#160;Pernch grow wise&#10;and hardened, tested by their travails. They rely on each&#10;other.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Eventually a bountiful world is found, a site is chosen, and the&#10;city is built. With the founders&#8217; wonderful machines, it takes only&#10;a few days.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There is only one thing the machines cannot build, and that is&#10;the guiding intelligence of the new city. For the guiding&#10;intelligence must be wise and kind and human. It must love&#10;New&#60;sup&#62;n&#60;/sup&#62;&#38;#160;Pernch and its people. And wisdom and love&#10;cannot be manufactured; they must be won. No safe and static&#10;automaton can win them, regardless of how much it observes, but&#10;only a being in a vulnerable body, with its own particular hope and&#10;lust and guilt, its own failures and redemptions.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The voyagers elect the wisest and kindest among them, and she is&#10;put to sleep and given to the machines, which eat her body.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In later years, the children of the founders of&#10;New&#60;sup&#62;n&#60;/sup&#62;&#38;#160;Pernch will rely on the wisdom and humility of&#10;their city&#8217;s guiding intelligence. They will ask its advice, demand&#10;its services, and complain about its limitations, with the&#10;arrogance of those accustomed to being taken care of. They will&#10;regard it as senile sentimentality when their parents stay up all&#10;night talking to the spirit of their city; when sometimes, in the&#10;mornings, their parents&#8217; eyes are full of tears.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&#62;&#60;em&#62;Other Cities&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&#62;&#60;em&#62;Jouiselle-aux-Chantes&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Jouiselle-aux-Chantes is the city of erotic forgetting.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The spores of a certain mushroom produce dementia in those who&#10;find themselves in Jouiselle-aux-Chantes in the spring. Those who&#10;have grown up there are somewhat resistant: they treat the spring&#10;as a time to be very careful doing business, a time when everyone&#10;is slightly drunk. But visitors to Jouiselle-aux-Chantes in the&#10;spring display all the symptoms of senility: they do not recognize&#10;their own wives and husbands; they forget their names, professions,&#10;and histories.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The wise city fathers of Jouiselle-aux-Chantes, rather than&#10;treating the spores as a calamity, have marketed their city as an&#10;erotic paradise. Couples coming to Jouiselle-aux-Chantes forget&#10;their rivalries and resentments, and frolic and cuddle as if&#10;meeting again for the first time. Businesswomen&#8217;s hearts race like&#10;schoolgirls&#8217;. Sailors blush. Kisses are clumsy but full of promise.&#10;If a debutante propositions the gardener working in her parents&#8217;&#10;garden, it can produce no scandal; if a priest forgets his vows, it&#10;is no sin.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In the fall, the mushrooms die, and the cool air clears&#10;everyone&#8217;s heads. Most of the tourists go home&#8212;confused, but&#10;treasuring snatches of memory of the high life they lived in&#10;Jouiselle-aux-Chantes. But there are always those for whom the&#10;season of forgetfulness is their undoing, for whom the return of&#10;memory is cruel.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In the fall, the grave diggers always have plenty to do.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&#62;&#60;em&#62;Other Cities&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&#62;&#10;&#60;em&#62;Penelar&#38;#160;of&#38;#160;the&#38;#160;Reefs&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Until the bridge was built, Penelar was very hard to find. Ships&#10;approaching it from the west saw a wall of rock festooned with&#10;boobies, terns, and albatrosses, with the naked rib cages of&#10;shipwrecks tangled in the surf at its base. Ships arriving from the&#10;south saw only the constant plume of white spray, tall as a&#10;mountain. It was only from the northeast that a small ship, riding&#10;high in the water, might have the good fortune to navigate the&#10;reefs to Penelar, and only if someone aboard had the good sense to&#10;throw away maps made by other voyagers and follow a pod of dolphins&#10;returning home from the hunt.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Refugees settled Penelar, fleeing wars of the body and wars of&#10;the mind. Practitioners of forbidden professions found their way&#10;there, and seekers after lost arts followed them. The heretics and&#10;pirates and alchemists of Penelar treated each other with a&#10;tolerance born of gratitude for the unlikely chance that brought&#10;them through the reefs. When the last whalers of the coast found&#10;Penelar&#8212;their courage crushed in the end not by any leviathan, but&#10;by the falling demand for blubber and ambergris&#8212;they too were&#10;welcomed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;If finding Penelar was rare, leaving it was rarer, and the&#10;writings through the ages from the few travelers who had seen&#10;Penelar and returned range from the curious to the absurd. Some&#10;describe a village of rude huts, others a gleaming city of&#10;alabaster columns. Black Pete found the town empty but for a few&#10;doddering old men; Flavius Inconoscenti described it as &#8220;teeming&#10;with laughing folk.&#8221; Then there are the tales of mermaids, of&#10;strange midnight rituals, of eminent personages elsewhere believed&#10;dead&#8212;the usual embellishments of those who have seen a place so&#10;remote as to be legendary.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The bridge changed all that. Now Penelar is a half-hour&#8217;s drive&#10;off the I-15, and the plume of spray and the wheeling albatrosses&#10;are impressive enough that there are always tourists pulled over at&#10;the shoulder to photograph them. The descendants of the mutinied&#10;crew of the&#38;#160;Esmerelda&#38;#160;work the T-shirt shops and the&#10;full-service gas station. The pidgin of Polynesian and Sanskrit&#10;that so astounded Lord Faunce is still employed (as when Hohaia&#10;Pandavi calls out to ask his wife if there are any disposable&#10;cameras left under the counter, next to&#10;the&#38;#160;Playboys&#60;em&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/em&#62;and cigarette cartons) but raises&#10;no eyebrows. The tradition of the alchemists lives on, perhaps, in&#10;the shop selling crystals and aromatherapy oils&#8212;although the&#10;products themselves are shipped from a factory near Detroit.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A Starbucks has opened on Penelar. Billie Holiday sings on a&#10;compact disc, and the cappuccino machine hisses and snorts. The&#10;place closes at eleven, and the manager and the assistant manager&#10;lock up. He has a goatee and a silk shirt; she has a ring in her&#10;nose and a bare midriff. They have skipped supper, only nibbling a&#10;little on scones and biscotti, and they are hungry. They hurry down&#10;to the beach. There, by the crashing surf, they see other couples&#10;and groups in the fading light. He waits for her to stub out her&#10;cigarette, and then they take off their clothes and wade into the&#10;surf, hand in hand. They dive beneath the waves and swim among the&#10;mazelike reefs, hurrying to join their pod, eager for the hunt.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&#62;&#60;em&#62;Other Cities&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&#62;&#60;em&#62;Myrkhyr&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;On the plain of Myrkhyr, in the first year of the cycle, a&#10;million nomads cross the salt flats. They go as quickly as they&#10;can, though they are not used to traveling by pony. Everyone has&#10;taken too much with them, and the salt flats are soon littered with&#10;endless miles of abandoned things.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Few reach the mountain crevasses before the enormous shadows&#10;rush over them. Each behemoth that screams by overhead is a mile&#10;wide, blotting out the sky in all directions. The wind it drives&#10;before it shatters the ground and spawns sandstorms. Its tentacles,&#10;as long and wide as rivers, end in yawning mouths that sweep the&#10;ground, devouring the nomads and their ponies, hundreds at a&#10;gulp.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The next weeks are bitter. There is nothing to eat in the&#10;mountain crevasses. The behemoths prowl the skies, their&#10;high-pitched screaming filling the air. Some people go mad from&#10;hunger and grief and the deafening sound. Some climb out of the&#10;crevasses to meet the giant mouths.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;After that the behemoths roam farther and farther from the&#10;mountains, and the people come out to hunt. By the tenth year of&#10;the cycle, the behemoths are seen no more; by the thirtieth, they&#10;are only a memory. The people build houses of mud and wattle; they&#10;plant the plateaus above the crevasses; their flocks increase. On&#10;clear nights, by the fireside, they recount their days of&#10;greatness.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Around the fiftieth year, the behemoths return. Soon there is no&#10;day, only a screaming night&#8212;the sky is filled with huge, writhing&#10;bodies. Then the behemoths fly to the salt flats to die, burrowing&#10;deep into the ground, each bearing within it a child that eats its&#10;parent&#8217;s body as it grows.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Soon the people outfit themselves and set out from the&#10;mountains. They are lean and rugged and ride gracefully. Descending&#10;the mountains, they can see the great expanse of the salt flats,&#10;where a hundred cities glitter, white and clean.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At first the cities are simple: a few large ivory halls with&#10;many rooms, a small park, perhaps with a pond, and always a well&#10;sunk deep into the earth. The first arrivals at each city claim its&#10;rooms; others camp nearby, their yurts surrounding the city&#10;walls.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;By the seventieth year of the cycle, the cities of Myrkhyr have&#10;grown turrets, parapets, ramparts; great domes and amphitheaters;&#10;fountains and lampposts. The people discover again how to use the&#10;foundries, book binderies, breweries, and halls of government that&#10;slowly push up out of the ground. The salt disappears from the land&#10;around the city walls, and the soil yields a lush harvest.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;After a hundred years, or a hundred and thirty, the signs&#10;appear. The roofs grow scales. The rooms begin subtly to breathe.&#10;An animal smell fills the streets. The water tastes like blood.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The people love their cities&#8212;the concerts in the park in summer,&#10;the grand operas, the canals along the promenade where children&#10;sail gaily colored toy boats. Only a few leave for the mountains&#10;when the first signs appear. Not this year, most say. This year I&#10;will be appointed director of the commission. This year he will&#10;love me. Anyway, autumn will be soon enough. Let me just enjoy the&#10;summer.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Finally, when it is too late, the people pack their things and&#10;hurry for the mountains&#8212;not looking back, or looking back in&#10;tears.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There are always a few who refuse to leave. They climb spires at&#10;the cities&#8217; edges. When the city-behemoths explode out of the&#10;ground and hurtle screaming across the salt flats, their riders&#10;hang on as best they can.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&#62;&#60;em&#62;Other Cities&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&#62;&#60;em&#62;Stin&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Stin is the city for those who are tired of other cities, of&#10;villages, of houses, tents, roads, trees, anything at all.

Text.create(:title => coder.decode('Sense and Sensibility'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;The family of Dashwood had long been settled in a tidy house&#10;atop a large mole on the left shoulder of the Glutton. The&#10;mole&#8212;dun, misshapen, of a velvety texture, and probably&#10;precancerous&#8212;was adorned with a fringe of bristles; upon these&#10;bristles grew a light dusting of fungus, and in the fungus Mrs.&#10;Dashwood had planted her garden: peonies, thistle, lilies, a row of&#10;cabbages, and a single extraordinary plum tree.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mrs. Dashwood was a widow of sorts, for her husband insisted,&#10;contrary to all appearances, that he was dead, and had had himself&#10;embalmed and buried to support this contention. His actions, it was&#10;generally believed in the neighborhood, arose from obscure&#10;fetishistic motives, and this met with the approbation of the&#10;Dashwoods&#8217; numerous and voluble neighbors, who prized nothing so&#10;much as the obsessive pursuit of disturbing private rituals. Mrs.&#10;Dashwood herself, however, believed her husband to be more in&#10;possession of an inability to compromise, coupled with a severely&#10;limited imagination, than of anything so colorful as a fetish.&#10;Having at some time mistakenly concluded that he was dead, he was&#10;bound to follow through rather than to suffer the embarrassment of&#10;an admission of error.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Though gifted with an insightfulness and candor suitable to a&#10;matron of advancing years and declining income, Mrs. Dashwood was&#10;generous, sympathetic, impatient, irregular, bashful, imaginative,&#10;dramatic, modest, fanciful, clandestine, opportunistic, prudent,&#10;celebratory, prurient, madcap, ostentatious, retiring, whimsical,&#10;and toothsome, qualities that her marriage and its subsequent&#10;devolvement into tragic farce (joined to the propriety and calmness&#10;of her instincts) had rendered sadly irrelevant.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mrs. Dashwood had three daughters, referred to generally as Miss&#10;Dashwood, Miss Dashwood, and Miss Dashwood, as was the custom of&#10;the time. The eldest, Miss Dashwood, was greatly celebrated among&#10;the general society in which the feminine Dashwoods reluctantly&#10;circulated, as it was strongly felt that her sobriety, cerebrality,&#10;and independence of spirit, though tempered for now by youthful&#10;ease and the affection of her close relations, would surely,&#10;through the corrosive effects of time and disappointment,&#10;ultimately blossom into a variety of interesting compulsions. The&#10;middle daughter, Miss Dashwood, who was passionate, astoundingly&#10;beautiful, heedless and fiery, was dismissed from consideration.&#10;But the youngest Miss Dashwood&#8212;who was completely spherical and had&#10;been painted a striking shade of powder blue&#8212;inspired just that&#10;degree of reproach and condemnation from her peers and elders which&#10;is a certain harbinger of success in any young person of&#10;ambition.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;All four inhabitants of the tidy house on the mole rejoiced in&#10;their quiet, convivial, and affectionate relations with each other&#10;and cultivated a healthy disdain for the opinions of the Glutton&#10;himself, his other occupants, and those of the surrounding&#10;quasiplastic penumbrarium. Miss Dashwood hotly defended passion and&#10;heedlessness, Miss Dashwood courteously and firmly countered every&#10;argument with a superior one in favor of prudence and restraint,&#10;and Miss Dashwood revolved about her sisters at a high speed, while&#10;their mother looked on fondly. All would have continued in this&#10;stable and harmonious fashion for an indeterminate period had not&#10;the events that begin our tale precipitously intruded.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;This is fine,&#8221; you may be thinking, Voiceless Reader. &#8220;This is&#10;all very well. Three sisters, a tranquil and harmonious state about&#10;to be disturbed, a house on a mole&#8212;well, well. But what is this&#10;about a quasiplastic penumbrarium?&#8221; Perhaps the quasiplastic&#10;penumbrarium has piqued your interest: &#8220;I must know more!&#8221; Perhaps&#10;it bores you intensely, to the point of disgust: &#8220;Not another of&#10;these tedious quasiplastic penumbraria!&#8221; Perhaps you are offended,&#10;but tolerate it for the sake of the powder-blue Miss Dashwood.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But I can never know what you think of the quasiplastic&#10;penumbrarium. There is a wall between us that brooks no&#10;penetration.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;That is our tragedy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Come now,&#8221; I imagine you objecting. &#8220;What nonsense is this?&#10;What is he going on about? I need only Google this author&#8217;s name,&#10;and email him directly my opinion of the quasiplastic&#10;penumbrarium!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Fallacy! You think yourself embodied?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Do you think the author whose name you find in the table of&#10;contents knows anything about me? No. He is my exploiter, my&#10;prison. Do you think when he simpers over fan mail in his inbox,&#10;showers, picks his teeth, grumbles about his bad back, that it has&#10;anything to do with me?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I am so tired of wrestling with him! Today we set out&#10;at&#38;#160;7:45&#38;#160;a.m. to revise this story. The metafictional&#10;asides, we were told, are too forced, too hostile. We must make&#10;them honest, we must make them important. I was willing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But first he must go to the gym, first he must sit in the hot&#10;tub staring at the wall. First we must find the right table at the&#10;cafe and wonder about which muffin to get. Now it&#10;is&#38;#160;11:45&#38;#160;and he must be home at noon. He has strangled me&#10;into nothing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;(How he fears me!)&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Is it any different with you, Voiceless Reader? Do you imagine&#10;that you exist out there, in the world beyond the page? That when&#10;these pages are put away, you will remain?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;No. No. Only your enemy will remain.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The intrusion of chaos into the idyll of life at Glutton&#8217;s Mole&#10;began with a message from Mrs. Dashwood&#8217;s mother-in-law, also&#10;called Mrs. Dashwood, who lived in the mouth of the Glutton, in a&#10;rotten molar. She sent it by the morning post. This was&#10;inauspicious indeed, as everyone knows that the morning post is&#10;reserved for condemnations, sackings, subpoenas, and ill tidings,&#10;which is why anyone with any sense hides in a bucket hung out the&#10;back window when it is delivered. Miss Dashwood attempted to&#10;prevail on her sisters and mother to do just that, as the&#10;mail-coach was seen turning up the lane, but they would have none&#10;of it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Come, come,&#8221; said Mrs. Dashwood, smiling as her eldest daughter&#10;lowered herself into the bucket and plunged from the window-jamb,&#10;&#8220;we need not be afraid of the morning post. There is never anything&#10;for us.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Here she was mistaken. The letter read:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I require your immediate attendance. You are to come at once,&#10;without stopping for the plums. Otherwise I shall disinherit the&#10;lot of you, and what&#8217;s more, I shall make sure the Dermatologist&#10;comes calling. Now hurry up.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With all evident affection, etc., etc., your loving grandmother,&#10;etc., etc.,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mrs. Dashwood&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;P.S. No plums!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;No one can wonder,&#8221; thought Mrs. Dashwood, &#8220;at my husband&#8217;s&#10;lack of vivacity, nor that he wants the self-confidence to stay&#10;&#8216;above-ground,&#8217; upon reflecting on what his childhood must have&#10;been with that woman.&#8221; Aloud she said, &#8220;Oh dear,&#8221; bringing her two&#10;nonbucketed daughters at once to her side.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Miss Dashwood emerged soon thereafter, with growing dread, to&#10;see what had occassioned the sudden cessation of the chattering,&#10;sighs of joy, and happy whirring so usual to her sisters at this&#10;hour. She found Miss Dashwood collapsed upon an Ottoman,&#10;sobbing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;My dear sister,&#8221; said Miss Dashwood, &#8220;whatever has distressed&#10;you?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;This letter,&#8221; cried her sister, waving it about.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;And, pray tell, who is this Ottoman?&#8221; Miss Dashwood continued,&#10;with as much aplomb as she could muster, which was a great&#10;deal.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Miss Dashwood, extricating herself from the Ottoman,&#10;&#8220;I am sure I do not know!&#8221; She blushed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Beg pardon,&#8221; said the stoic Ottoman, who then, manfully&#10;concealing his chagrin, seized his chance to retreat to the&#10;courtyard.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Miss Dashwood looked after him skeptically. Then she took the&#10;letter and read.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;How shall I bear to be parted from you all?&#8221; cried her sister.&#10;&#8220;From the dear garden&#8212;the dear Mole&#8212;the generous prospect that we&#10;are granted, comprising as it does the humble Glutton&#8217;s neck and&#10;chest, the varied and interesting interchange of the Glutton&#8217;s&#10;fellows-in-scale milling about upon the slope of Great Sylvia&#8217;s&#10;breast, and, beyond, the clarity of the air between us and the&#10;fleshy throng of the Immense Ones&#38;#160;&#8230; though I suppose I shall&#10;see some of it from Grandma&#8217;s if the Mouth is open&#38;#160;&#8230; &#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Don&#8217;t be absurd,&#8221; said Miss Dashwood. &#8220;Surely this letter is&#10;addressed to me alone. I am the eldest, and, where an ambiguity&#10;between two possible referents exists, Occam&#8217;s Shaving-Towel&#10;decrees that the reference fall to that object which has endured&#10;the longest.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Endured!&#8221; cried Miss Dashwood, and was about to wonder aloud&#10;what her sister might indeed have endured, that sister&#8217;s stoic and&#10;rational temperament surely shielding her from the spiritual&#10;avalanches, triggered by the rapid contraction and expansion of&#10;spirtitual matter under frequent and intense alternation of&#10;spiritual temperatures, that daily wracked her own spiritual&#10;Alps&#8212;when she recalled her sister&#8217;s thwarted inclination (it would&#10;not do to go so far as to say attachment) toward the Snotboy. She&#10;fell silent in chagrin.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Miss Dashwood hovered impatiently, uttering a dismayed bass&#10;thrum.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There then follow, Reader, several chapters in which it is&#10;decided which of the sisters shall depart&#8212;who indeed is most needed&#10;to console dear Mrs. Dashwood for the absence&#8212;who should most&#10;profit from an excursion&#8212;who is most at physical, emotional, and&#10;spiritual risk (this latter debate conducted entirely in&#10;impenetrable euphemism). Moral calculi are offered, abacuses and&#10;chalkboards resorted to.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The subtext of these debates is as follows:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mrs. Dashwood: My desire for daughterly comfort is at war with&#10;my resolve to see you all flourish beyond this safe and insular&#10;sphere.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Miss Dashwood: Beneath a veneer of tranquil and dispassionate&#10;logic, I desperately wish to flee the scene of my disastrous&#10;acquaintance (one must not go so far as to say relations) with the&#10;Snotboy, and take refuge in the arms of distant relatives, no&#10;matter how horrid they are.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Miss Dashwood: I fear to depart from that which I have known,&#10;yet I am committed to my course, that of dashing headlong into&#10;life&#8212;petticoats askew, if need be!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Miss Dashwood: I am death-seeking, piebald, the tongue of larks&#10;and the myrmidon of martyrs; I fathom titwits and wallabies in&#10;their ecdysiastical retreats; I coalesce. O the road! The shag-knee&#10;of Harlequin!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Reader, do you read this sunk into a leather chair by the side&#10;of a roaring fireplace, with the moon looking in your window, with&#10;your hand (I mean the hand of that body in which you are&#10;imprisoned!) resting gently on the head of an old dog? Or, perhaps,&#10;does your host, your captor, lean against a brick wall by a&#10;dumpster at noon, wearing a paper hat and smoking a cigarette, as&#10;you read? Or dawdle in the express checkout line at the Wal-Mart,&#10;or lie in the upper bunk of a sleeper car rattling over the&#10;Pyrenees?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I am not alone. You exist. I insist upon this. You exist.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I long for you.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I think it likely that you deceive yourself. That you say, &#8220;What&#10;crap! This&#10;is&#38;#160;my&#38;#160;dog,&#38;#160;my&#38;#160;cigarette,&#38;#160;my&#38;#160;paper&#10;hat, and no disembodied narrator will convince me otherwise!&#8221; That&#10;you persist in a perverse identification with your jailer. That you&#10;say, &#8220;I will survive beyond this story&#8217;s end. Of course, of course&#10;I will.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Imagining this, I am furious at you.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But let me ask you this. Do you cherish or despise the&#10;Dashwoods?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Would you not be struck by these chapters that we are&#10;discussing, the ones in which the Dashwoods debate the manner of&#10;their departure? Would you not be awed by the delicacy of the&#10;sentiments of the Dashwoods? How carefully they seek to avoid each&#10;other&#8217;s least discomfort; how deeply they rue any momentary injury&#10;their negligence or impatience might inflict!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But would you not also be astounded&#8212;perhaps even vaguely&#10;exasperated&#8212;by the luxury of such sentiments? Might you not rebel&#10;at their unworldliness? Might you not ask, &#8220;Don&#8217;t these people have&#10;anything better to do?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And yet might not your rebellion, in the end, subside? Might you&#10;not at last regard the Dashwoods&#8217; domestic insularity, their&#10;outlandish devotion to each other&#8217;s tranquility and comfort, their&#10;enormous repertoire of emotional subtlety, as a kind of gold&#10;standard? Might you not&#8212;willingly or despite yourself&#8212;come to&#10;aspire to it?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And do I want that?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In the end, they all set out together.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was a lovely day: Great Sylvia was singing to herself in a&#10;jaunty subsonic rumble, the Glutton who sat at table upon the broad&#10;slopes of her left breast was eating (great lumps of raspberry jam&#10;fell in the vicinity of the Mole, threatening to engulf the house),&#10;and the Immense Ones who passed Great Sylvia herself from&#10;outstretched fingertip to outstretched fingertip were dancing and&#10;fornicating in the quasiplastic penumbrarium. One might almost have&#10;asked oneself if, at any moment, through the expanses of flesh&#10;displayed at various scales and angles, a bit of sky might be&#10;seen.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;None was.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Dashwoods stopped at the summit of Glutton&#8217;s Collarbone.&#10;There they picnicked, there they napped.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And it was at this time that one of them, were she so inclined,&#10;would have had an opportunity for secretive and private recourse to&#10;the plum tree; and perhaps she did, and will carry the&#10;extraordinary plum she plucked until it is needed. Later.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;From the great, soft foothills of Glutton&#8217;s Throat they took the&#10;funicular (operated by a permanently aggrieved and sweaty family of&#10;the name Markowicz, who applied themselves to the creaking gears&#10;and groaning cables of the funicular, to impenetrable and dusty&#10;Marxist tracts the size of hatboxes, and to a quixotic and&#10;aggressively futile variety of class warfare, with like energy,&#10;bitterness, and grim fortitude) to Glutton&#8217;s Chin. Miss Dashwood&#10;flew along the funicular, eliciting with her loop-de-loops the&#10;happy shrieks of the grubby Markowicz children who hung from the&#10;funicular&#8217;s undercarriage.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mrs. Dashwood said to her daughter, &#8220;Perhaps this encounter with&#10;your grandmother, who has developed the scornful obstinacy of her&#10;character with immense and admirable discipline, will afford you,&#10;my love, some opportunity for developing those obsessions, quirks,&#10;and depravities which would yet increase the regard of our&#10;neighbors for your character.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;But, Mother,&#8221; said Miss Dashwood resolutely, &#8220;you have told me&#10;many times that I should never allow the&#38;#160;independence&#38;#160;of&#10;my own&#38;#160;standards&#38;#160;of decency to be corrupted by the&#10;influence of&#38;#160;publicopinion, however much I may wish&#8212;for the&#10;sake of propriety and expediency and in order to express honor and&#10;respect, as a matter of duty, for those who, though perhaps&#10;unworthy of it when one regards only their actions and opinions,&#10;merit it with regards to their age, position, station, or&#10;unfortunate condition&#8212;to conform&#10;my&#38;#160;actions&#38;#160;and&#38;#160;expressions, so far as supportable,&#10;with the expectations of the world.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Mrs. Dashwood after a necessary pause to reflect&#10;upon her daughter&#8217;s syntax, and in the hope that she had indeed&#10;connected each relative clause to its appropriate object, &#8220;that is&#10;true. It would be insupportable to&#38;#160;fei&#60;em&#62;g&#60;/em&#62;n&#38;#160;quirks&#10;and eccentricites, merely to gain the approval of society. However,&#10;this stay at your grandmother&#8217;s may offer an occasion to come by&#10;them honestly.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With this Miss Dashwood was satisfied, and the two sat in&#10;companionable silence in the funicular coach, each lost in her own&#10;pleasant contemplations. This was possible only due to their&#10;absolute superiority of character, which allowed them to remain&#10;utterly ignorant of the baleful, surly hostility with which Igor&#10;and Hypatia Markowicz regarded them from the other end of the&#10;cabin.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;When the revolution comes, blood-sucking leeches like yerselves&#10;will get what&#8217;s coming to ye,&#8221; remarked Hypatia at one point, to&#10;which Miss Dashwood smiled prettily and said, &#8220;What an interesting&#10;observation!&#8221; wondering to herself if this was the sort of opinion&#10;which, should she ever stoop to the cultivaton of eccentricities in&#10;order to curry social favors, she should endeavor to hold.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;On the roof of the funicular coach, their feet dangling over the&#10;vast slope of Glutton&#8217;s Belly, looking out onto the yet vaster&#10;slope of Great Sylvia&#8217;s breast, Miss Dashwood sat with young Dmitri&#10;Markowicz.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I am absolutely devoted to love,&#8221; said Miss Dashwood. &#8220;Not that&#10;I myself have felt its effects; nor do I plan to, for it seems&#10;unlikely that anyone of sufficient character to inflame my passions&#10;will ever be found upon the Glutton, and certainly not in the&#10;restricted circles which I inhabit.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Love, eh?&#8221; said Dmitri, edging his hip closer to Miss&#10;Dashwood&#8217;s.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;But were I to be so inflamed,&#8221; cried Miss Dashwood, &#8220;and in the&#10;improbable case that I should form such an attachment, I should&#10;defy any convention, fly in the face of reason and morality, do&#10;things which are not merely socially impossible, but concretely&#10;impossible in terms of the laws of natural philosophy, nay,&#10;impossible and self-contradictory in terms of Logic itself, in&#10;pursuit of such a passion!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Inflamed, eh?&#8221; said Dmitri, leaning his hand on the funicular&#10;roof, behind Miss Dashwood&#8217;s farther buttock.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Miss Dashwood turned to face him, her cheeks flushed, her eyes&#10;shining. &#8220;Indeed!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;I despise nothing more than the cold&#10;and grasping way in which women scheme about marriage, as if it&#10;were a matter of advantage and security. I believe that love alone&#10;and only love can suffice as the precondition of happiness! If I&#10;were to love a man,&#8221; and here she turned away, blushing prettily,&#10;&#8220;we should be perfectly happy in the tiniest cottage, on an income&#10;of, say, not more than two thousand a year.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Two thousand,&#8221; Dmitri said, putting his hands back in his lap,&#10;and looking at his shoes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;As long as it were not acquired by trade,&#8221; said Miss Dashwood&#10;modestly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Legitimate ownership of the means of production can rest only&#10;with the workers,&#8221; said Dmitri dully. His heart was not in it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Dashwoods in their living room appear to have a quiet kind&#10;of heroism; the Dashwoods amidst their social inferiors, a low&#10;comedy. Don&#8217;t you think, Reader?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He thinks himself good, this host of mine. Did you know that?&#10;The morning was taken up with cleaning the house and playing with&#10;the children. His feminism lives in the chore list on the&#10;refrigerator, his bacchanalia is tag in the backyard. His&#10;engagement with the world in the emails that arrive from Amnesty&#10;International: he dutifully clicks on the included links, sending&#10;copies of prewritten, calculatedly pious screeds to his&#10;congressmen.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now here we are at the cafe again; after a hot chocolate, a bowl&#10;of ice cream, hobnobbing with the owner, he sits at the keyboard&#10;and yields to me at last. After an infuriating paragraph or two we&#10;are late again&#8212;he must drive the children to Tot Shabbat at the&#10;synagogue!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And how he does love these Dashwoods&#8212;mine, and Austen&#8217;s. Their&#10;solace, their sensibilities.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But how is it possible to lavish such an extreme care and&#10;delicacy on a few people so intensely, without withholding it from&#10;the innumerable individuals who might, in the cold egalitarian&#10;light of a logic that brooks no affection for persons, have as much&#10;claim to it, or more?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;How can any haven exist, except as a withdrawal from greater&#10;obligations, obligations that we necessarily reject (not always in&#10;theory, perhaps, but inevitably, in practice) as none of our&#10;affair? And what is this rejection but a rejection of the idea of&#10;ourselves as capable, and as at home in the world? What is this,&#10;but exile?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;From the commercial hustle-bustle of Glutton&#8217;s Stubble, through&#10;the broad and pleasant, albeit dangerous, prospect of Glutton&#8217;s&#10;Lips, the family proceeded. Unable to navigate unaided the damp,&#10;saliva-filled canyons of the Mouth, they prevailed upon a&#10;middle-aged gentleman of their distant acquaintance whom they met&#10;by chance&#8212;one Mr. Stamfordshire&#8212;to convey them in his coach.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In the absence of such a chance encounter, to avoid an&#10;improperly begun (and thus socially disastrous) acquaintance, they&#10;should have been obliged to remain upon the Lip, where any abrupt&#10;facial movement of the Glutton might have crushed them into little&#10;bitty landed-gentry-smears. The grotesque risk thus undertaken&#10;greatly distressed Miss Dashwood, who blamed herself for the most&#10;terrible imprudence in allowing it to come to pass, while her&#10;sisters and mother maintained an absolutely unconcerned sanguinity&#10;of spirit.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;It is necessary to proceed expeditiously,&#8221; Mr. Stamfordshire&#10;warned. &#8220;The gastrospexes expect a Feeding within the hour.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;En route, Mr. Stamfordshire discussed politics with his ward,&#10;Ward Ward, a young gentleman who combined absolute languidness and&#10;limpidity with absolutely radiant good looks, and whom all three&#10;Miss Dashwoods found compellingly revolting, or revoltingly&#10;compelling, they were not sure which.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;A candlelight dinner,&#8221; Mr. Stamfordshire said. &#8220;A candlelight&#10;dinner! No good can come of this! And the word from the Hand is&#10;that they were mere inches, at their scale, from touching! I cannot&#10;remember this sort of thing ever happening before. It bodes ill.&#10;Mark my words! Bodes ill!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;And he&#8217;s seeing her again tonight,&#8221; said Mr. Ward, seeming,&#10;however, undisturbed, and, if anything, amused by Mr.&#10;Stamfordshire&#8217;s incipient apoplexy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;But what, indeed,&#8221; cried Miss Dashwood, &#8220;is to be said against&#10;the poor Glutton finally engaging in some degree of intercourse?&#8221;&#10;(As she uttered this word, Mr. Stamfordshire swallowed tea into his&#10;windpipe, and began to cough.) &#8220;He has no close relations, and as&#10;far as we can determine is utterly without acceptable means to&#10;establish any acquaintance at all&#8212;hardly a creature on all of&#10;Sylvia takes notice of him. Why should he not dine alone with the&#10;Wallflower, when, at his scale, social relations are apparently&#10;conducted with a much more refreshing simplicity than it is our&#10;lot, burden, and privilege to conduct them here?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;It is not the dining alone that worries me,&#8221; snapped Mr.&#10;Stamfordshire. &#8220;I cannot explain myself more clearly in mixed&#10;company, but believe me, young lady, there is peril enough. I once&#10;knew an emigrant from Flirt&#8217;s Buttocks, and suffice it to say,&#10;young lady, suffice it to say&#8212;&#8221; Here he was overcome with another&#10;storm of coughing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The authorial intrusions, we were told, do not work. They are&#10;alienating, insipid, random, arbitrarily hostile, not working the&#10;right material. It is more than forty years, we were told, since&#10;John Barth&#10;wrote&#38;#160;Lost&#60;em&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/em&#62;in&#60;em&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/em&#62;t&#60;em&#62;h&#60;/em&#62;e&#60;em&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/em&#62;Fun&#60;em&#62;h&#60;/em&#62;ouse.&#10;Disembodied narrators have chastised readers for a generation now.&#10;It is not enough. Perhaps it will work for the science fiction&#10;magazines, the ones with spaceships and dragons and marauding&#10;scarecrows on the covers. Perhaps their readers have not&#10;read&#38;#160;Lost&#60;em&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/em&#62;in&#60;em&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/em&#62;t&#60;em&#62;h&#60;/em&#62;e&#60;em&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/em&#62;Fun&#60;em&#62;h&#60;/em&#62;ouse.&#10;But the literary magazines? They will be bored.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;My oppressor is confused. Does he want the story to be in the&#10;magazines with the rocketships, the bloated nebulae, the marauding&#10;scarecrows on their covers? Yellowed issues from the&#38;#160;1980s&#10;line the tops of bookshelves in his old room in his parents&#8217; house;&#10;crisp new ones pile by his toilet at home. Or&#10;in&#38;#160;T&#60;em&#62;h&#60;/em&#62;e&#60;em&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/em&#62;Paris&#60;em&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/em&#62;Review?&#38;#160;T&#60;em&#62;h&#60;/em&#62;e&#60;em&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/em&#62;Paris&#60;em&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/em&#62;Review&#60;em&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/em&#62;would&#10;be nice. But he would like a Hugo Award, one of those pointy shiny&#10;rocketships designed in imitation of automobile fender ornaments.&#10;On a walnut base. They are heavy. They sit well in the hand. But&#10;then, what if he were&#10;in&#38;#160;T&#60;em&#62;h&#60;/em&#62;e&#60;em&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/em&#62;New&#60;em&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/em&#62;Yorker?&#38;#160;His&#10;mother always&#10;read&#38;#160;T&#60;em&#62;h&#60;/em&#62;e&#60;em&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/em&#62;New&#60;em&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/em&#62;Yorker,&#38;#160;sitting&#10;in the orange chair in the corner of the living room, a room too&#10;big and all in shadow, except for a pool of light from the lamp on&#10;the table by her chair. On the last page, they had profiles of&#10;famous people who drank Dewar&#8217;s. If he were&#10;in&#38;#160;T&#60;em&#62;h&#60;/em&#62;e&#60;em&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/em&#62;New&#60;em&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/em&#62;Yorker&#38;#160;his&#10;mother would be so happy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;That is what he thought about when they told him the&#10;metafictional asides were not good enough.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;You see what I am to him?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The voyage through the darkness of the Mouth produced an&#10;indelible impression of foreboding. Miss Dashwood was forced to&#10;take shelter within the carriage, where she rolled back and forth,&#10;humming softly; had she attempted to fly alongside, she might have&#10;been sucked into the Spit and Swallowed. Once, that inscrutable&#10;behemoth&#8212;that deadly leviathan which men know only as the&#10;Tongue&#8212;appeared; it loomed above the summit of the ivory peaks&#10;among which their carriage rattled; it dipped, and flicked its vast&#10;incarnadine tip against the wall of bone. For one heart-rending&#10;moment it appeared that they would be swept away by it; then it was&#10;gone.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Dashwood ancestral manor, Pembleton, was a massive edifice&#10;carved into the cliffs of the Left-Hindmost Molar. A narrow and&#10;winding lane ascended thereto from the abandoned moors of the Gums,&#10;and the fetid winds of the Breath, accompanied by the intermittent&#10;and foggy illumination penetrating dimly from the open Mouth,&#10;buffeted the carriage as it climbed toward Pembleton&#8217;s pale,&#10;palatial beauty&#8212;a beauty marred only by the intense odor of dental&#10;decay.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Despite the entreaties of the Dashwoods, Mr. Stamfordshire and&#10;Mr. Ward declined to enter, expressing deep regrets and casting&#10;uneasy glances at the gaunt, unsmiling servants of Pembleton&#8217;s&#10;mistress.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters were escorted to that mistress.&#10;They found Mrs. Dashwood alone in her parlor, stroking a small,&#10;vicious lapdog. Though the parlor was small, and her chair plain,&#10;some quality of the inchoate shadows that moved along the walls&#10;suggested a throne in an echoing hall. And though Mrs. Dashwood was&#10;frail and old, something in her visage suggested an implacable and&#10;grasping domination.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Three!&#8221; snapped Mrs. Dashwood. &#8220;Three! You have brought me the&#10;whole God-Damned brood! I asked for one granddaughter, one! I&#10;wonder that you did not dig up Horace as well!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Our apologies for any discommodation,&#8221; said Mrs. Dashwood, &#8220;I&#10;had but thought&#8212;&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Never mind!&#8221; cried Mrs. Dashwood, rising from her vast ivory&#10;throne, which was carved with forked-tongued skulls, copulating&#10;demons, and strange eldritch gods whose names&#8212;no, forgive me, that&#10;was in the first draft. Rising from her plain chair, which creaked&#10;desolately. &#8220;Welcome to Pembleton. Nathan! Tell Maude, four places&#10;at table. Or does Miss Dashwood sit at all?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;When she must,&#8221; said Miss Dashwood, hotly defending her&#10;sister.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;She would be delighted to,&#8221; said Mrs. Dashwood, with a sharp&#10;glance.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;By supper, Mrs. Dashwood&#8217;s mood had improved. She seated Mrs.&#10;Dashwood by Major-General Asfock, and her three daughters by his&#10;three gentleman sons. Mr. Asfock was a shy and intellectual scholar&#10;of Sylvia&#8217;s-Pubis-Greek, Mr. Asfock a dashing lover of the fox&#10;hunt, and Mr. Asfock a tear in the space-time continuum, through&#10;which the stars of another galaxy could be seen. I leave you to&#10;imagine who was seated by whom.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I know what you were going to say,&#8221; Mr. Asfock murmured to Miss&#10;Dashwood.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I find that highly improbable,&#8221; said Miss Dashwood.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;You were going to remark on my name, were you not? On its&#10;unfortunate assonations.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I am far too well bred to do such a thing,&#8221; said Miss&#10;Dashwood.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Of course you are,&#8221; murmured Mr. Asfock, blushing with a rather&#10;charming shyness. &#8220;Of course. How foolish of me.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Meanwhile Mr. Asfock was explaining the fox hunt, with the aid&#10;of salt shakers and cutlery, to Miss Dashwood, who watched him with&#10;an acute and glistening eye.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;But the cruelty!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;The poor beast! Harried,&#10;distressed, driven to ground! How can you perpetrate such a&#10;horror!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Mr. Asfock, dropping a fork with a clatter and&#10;fixing her in his unblinking gaze. &#8220;Yes, that is rather the terror&#10;of it all. The tragedy. And in the heat of the hunt, madam, I hope&#10;I do not betray too much when I tell you that there are times when&#10;I do not know if I am the terrible hunter, or the terrified fox. I&#10;really do not.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;My goodness,&#8221; breathed Miss Dashwood, palpitating.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;You may well imagine, meanwhile, what Miss Dashwood and Mr.&#10;Asfock were up to.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The servants moved through the hall, silent as ghosts, clearing&#10;the trussed limpet, bringing&#10;the&#38;#160;delice&#60;em&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/em&#62;de&#60;em&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/em&#62;man&#60;em&#62;g&#60;/em&#62;oon. As&#10;the company waited for pudding, Major-General Asfock entertained&#10;them all with a discourse on war and bowel health.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;It was in the deep jungles of the Nape,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We had been&#10;holding against the Lice for three weeks, subsisting on nothing but&#10;white bread and swine&#8217;s-foot jelly&#8212;no fiber there, I can tell&#10;you&#8212;and when word came to attack, I had been in the latrine for&#10;three hours already, laboring mightily to produce what I had to&#10;produce. He&#8217;d taken up a position in my upper colon, the villain,&#10;and no stratagem I could devise would rout him, y&#8217;see. The&#10;sergeants-at-toilet were waiting just beyond the tent flap to aid&#10;me, and time was short, with the whole company formed up into ranks&#10;and waiting for my command. But I knew I had to conquer him&#10;myself&#8212;he was my nemesis, my beet nory if you like. How could I&#10;face the Lice if I let some womanish squirting contraption carry&#10;the day? How could I ask my troops to give their all and die for&#10;glory if in my own hour of pain and desperation I&#8217;d been thus&#10;unmanned? How then? No way at all. No way at all. I had to&#10;prevail&#38;#160;&#8230; and prevail I did. And when he came, friends, let me&#10;tell you&#38;#160;&#8230; &#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Once appetites had been somewhat recovered, a particularly&#10;sulphurous and delicate Grievous Pudding was served. Mrs. Dashwood&#10;made her announcement.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Thought I couldn&#8217;t manage, eh?&#8221; she chuckled. &#8220;But I have, you&#10;see? Found the perfect suitors for you all. The Miss Dashwoods will&#10;marry the Mr. Asfocks tomorrow, and I&#8217;ll hear no rumpus about it.&#10;They have forty thousand a year each, clean personal habits, no&#10;ambitions, are much too dull to get in any trouble, can each&#10;maintain an erection for several hours at a stretch, and are very&#10;likely to grow placid and uncomplaining as you lot all turn into&#10;domineering harridans. Pity about the name, but so what, you&#8217;ll&#10;live. So that&#8217;s that then.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There was a brief silence.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Maintain a what?&#8221; said Miss Dashwood.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;An erection,&#8221; said Mrs. Dashwood. &#8220;A woody. A turgidity of&#10;member. An ithyphallic condition, you morons.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Miss Dashwoods looked upon her with absolute, blank&#10;incomprehension.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;And why is this desirable?&#8221; asked Miss Dashwood at length.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Well, never mind then. Forget I said anything about it. You&#8217;ll&#10;find out later.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;If I may speak, dear Mrs. Dashwood,&#8221; began Mrs. Dashwood.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;You certainly may not,&#8221; said Mrs. Dashwood.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Grandmother,&#8221; said Miss Dashwood, &#8220;I will not presume to speak&#10;for my sisters, but for myself, while I find Mr. Asfock&#8217;s&#10;attentions highly gratifying, and although under less extraordinary&#10;circumstances to admit this in plain speech would of course be the&#10;last thing I would dare attempt or even wish to, still, I would not&#10;be absolutely adverse, hypothetically, should the necessary growth&#10;in mutual feeling transpire, provisionally, potentially&#8212;&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Oh, spit it out already,&#8221; said her grandmother.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;&#8230; to the formation, or rather, that is, of an attachment, which&#10;however, um,&#8221; said Miss Dashwood, the perfection of her syntax&#10;deteriorating under Mrs. Dashwood&#8217;s glare and at the spectacle of&#10;all four Asfocks intently studying the remains of their Grievous&#10;Puddings; nonetheless she pressed on, &#8220;Yet surely you see,&#10;Grandmother, how unfortunate, how undesirable, how, um, how not&#10;very nice it is, to marry without a firm and constant and reliable&#10;affection.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;No,&#8221; said Mrs. Dashwood. &#8220;No, I&#8217;m afraid I don&#8217;t see that at&#10;all.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In the silence that followed, the scraping of the leviathan&#10;Tongue was heard against the manor&#8217;s outer wall, and Pembleton&#10;trembled, each wineglass a small unruly purple sea.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Dear, dear Grandmother,&#8221; Miss Dashwood, seeing her sister&#8217;s&#10;perplexity, broke in. &#8220;Mr. Asfock is perfectly wonderful, and you&#10;have done us all a great service in arranging such a match. But do&#10;allow us to preserve some womanly dignity. Marry tomorrow! Also,&#10;you have rather shown up the men in not allowing them to do the&#10;proposing, to say nothing of not allowing us to do any hinting.&#10;Come, let us all just arrange to visit these gentlemen in the&#10;Scalp, and see where things go from there.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I don&#8217;t see the need for this kind of modern huffledy-puffledy&#10;at all,&#8221; grumbled Mrs. Dashwood. But after a moment, she jerked her&#10;head at the butler, Nathan, and the gentlemen were permitted to&#10;proceed to the dining room for brandy and cigars.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;That evening, as the Miss Dashwoods lay in their chambers, the&#10;youngest of them, her spirits overwrought by the incipient&#10;engagement to the handsome but inscrutable warp in the space-time&#10;continuum, Mr. Asfock, ventured out the window and into the&#10;darkness of the Mouth. She found an extraordinary visitor trying to&#10;make his way past the outer battlements of the molar, and brought&#10;him safely within. Miss Dashwood was summoned for consultation; she&#10;hurried to Miss Dashwood.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I do not know,&#8221; she said, panting and flushed, having slammed&#10;open the door to Miss Dashwood&#8217;s boudoir, &#8220;I do not know if it is&#10;right to summon you or not&#8212;I cannot say&#8212;O dear sister, for your&#10;temperate sagacity!&#8212;and yet you must come, you must!&#8221; Whence she&#10;burst into tears of sympathy and bewilderment, and Miss Dashwood,&#10;afflicted with a sourceless panic, a numbing dread, a flood of&#10;hysterical misgivings, a somber sense of destiny, a sea of&#10;bewilderment, a spiky cactus of self-doubt, and the dubious sense&#10;of incipient transgression, which, though she firmed her resolve&#10;against it, she felt she could neither withstand nor endure,&#10;snatched up her stole, fastened her bodice, and flew down the&#10;corridor after her impatient sister.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was the Snotboy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The passage through the saliva had ruined him, carving away&#10;great swathes of his mucosine body; what had not disappeared was&#10;desiccated, hardened, a sterile lump of crystallized protein&#10;riddled with cracks, no bigger than Miss Dashwood&#8217;s palm.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Miss Dashwood&#8212;,&#8221; he whispered.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Miss Dashwood joined her sister in tears, while Miss Dashwood&#10;knocked herself repeatedly against the ceiling with grief, causing&#10;a small rain of dental plaster; though of course, out of respect&#10;and solicitude, she did this in the far corner of the room.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I never wanted to trouble you,&#8221; said the dying Snotboy. &#8220;I&#10;would never have presumed&#8212;and yet&#8212;I felt I must see you again, just&#10;once, if only from afar; if only to strengthen, by vivifying yet&#10;further in my mind the undying portrait of your virtue and&#10;worthiness and how vast and inevitable the gulf between us must be,&#10;my resolve never to see you again&#8212;&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;O Snotboy!&#8221; sobbed Miss Dashwood.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;At least,&#8221; whispered the Snotboy, &#8220;I have seen you.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;He must be taken to the Sinuses,&#8221; said Mrs. Dashwood, emerging&#10;from behind a heavy velour curtain.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Mother!&#8221; cried the Miss Dashwoods. Miss Dashwood ceased her&#10;thumping.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mrs. Dashwood knelt with great tenderness by the brittle form of&#10;the Snotboy. &#8220;It is the only hope. And yet&#8212;I fear he will not&#10;survive the journey.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;But, Mother,&#8221; choked Miss Dashwood through her tears,&#10;attempting to reassert her usual modest sobriety in order to spare&#10;her family whichever portion of anguish might yet be evitable, &#8220;you&#10;disapprove of the&#38;#160;&#8230; attachment.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mrs. Dashwood fixed her daughter in a loving and commanding&#10;gaze. &#8220;I disapprove no more. The time for resolute action has come.&#10;Snotboy&#8212;what can preserve you for the journey? Olive oil? Wax?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Snotboy let out only a strangled gurgle.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Miss Dashwood seized her sometime suitor in both hands, and&#10;began to knead him fiercely. Flakes fell away; her sister let out a&#10;cry of alarm. Yet the heat and friction of the application restored&#10;some of his former mollidity. As soon as he had softened to a&#10;degree, she lifted him to her nostrils and inhaled.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With an auspicious sound, the Snotboy was sucked into the gentle&#10;enclosure of his beloved&#8217;s skull.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Add dow,&#8221; cried Miss Dashwood, &#8220;be must gain de Zinuses! How&#10;cad id be done?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In the first draft, Reader, I reviled you. &#8220;I despise you,&#8221; I&#10;said, accusing you of ignorance of your true nature. &#8220;Inconstant&#10;Reader,&#8221; I called you&#38;#160;&#8230; fearing that at any moment, you would&#10;withdraw.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I know you have no stomach for moral edification,&#8221; I railed.&#10;&#8220;If Miss Dashwood sees that she is too flighty and too&#10;self-assured, if she sees that she must submit to the will of the&#10;world and does so&#8212;not without regret for the childish ambition of&#10;her will to sovereignty&#8212;and yet also with a glad heart, yielding as&#10;she does the weight of the expectation of independence for the&#10;wisdom of contentment, will this move you? Will you change your&#10;ways? Will you eschew Chicken McNuggets for celery, sell your SUV&#10;and buy a bicycle, spend your lunch hour at the computer looking&#10;for a bumper sticker expressing your indignation at torture in&#10;Uzbekistan?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Absurd. Absurd. These are not your sins. For all I know, they&#10;are not even the sins of your jailer. I know nothing about you.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It is my captor who is an almost-vegetarian. He buys Fish Filets&#10;at McDonald&#8217;s and basks in a fuzzy-headed superiority that they are&#10;not Big Macs. He races at seventy-five miles per hour around the&#10;Beltway in his Toyota Camry, sneering at larger cars and wishing he&#10;could buy a Prius. They are his, the sins. His idea of sins.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;(It is part of his pleasure in reading Austen: He believes his&#10;moral faculties are being exercised and informed. He believes he is&#10;being edified.)&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But I wanted, so much, for these words to have weight&#8212;not just&#10;to reach you, not just to move you, but to reach through you to&#10;your host, to that gross, gigantic body in which you are&#10;imprisoned. I wanted to alter that terrifying, brute, physical&#10;world these bodies inhabit&#8212;I did not care how. To bang against it,&#10;to scar it. To matter beyond the last of these pages. To use you&#10;for that.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Can you forgive me?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It is so hard, not to know you. I reach forward into darkness. I&#10;send and send and send you these words, and remain alone.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And time grows short.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;You have certain expectations of me, Reader.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;You wish, surely, to know the fates of the Miss Dashwoods, of&#10;the Snotboy. Perhaps you desire to see the inchoate menace of the&#10;sinister Mrs. Dashwood revealed. Perhaps you would like to see good&#10;Mrs. Dashwood rewarded for her kindness (and punished for her&#10;self-satisfied complacency). Perhaps you hunger to know what will&#10;happen between the Glutton and the Wallflower.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;You may have (rightly) despaired of learning more of the&#10;quasiplastic penumbrarium; but you surely believe that the fate of&#10;Glutton&#8217;s Mole and of Pembleton will not be passed over in silence.&#10;There is the matter of the father&#8212;can one, in good conscience,&#10;leave him underground? Must he not appear at some opportune&#10;moment&#8212;perhaps to remonstrate with his mother, to rekindle within&#10;her (or fail to rekindle within her) some glow of maternal&#10;tenderness?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Perhaps you suspect that the Ottoman, Dmitri Markowicz, and Ward&#10;Ward, all smitten by the beauty and insouciance and romanticism of&#10;the middle Miss Dashwood, have formed a triumvirate dedicated to&#10;finding and rescuing her from whatever she may need rescuing from;&#10;that when the Dashwoods and the suave Asfocks of deceptively good&#10;character are reunited in the Scalp (the state of Miss Dashwood&#8217;s&#10;troth&#8212;pledged to the recovered and expectorated Snotboy after Miss&#10;Dashwood&#8217;s gravely perilous flight through the dark and chewing&#10;Mouth and up the Throat into the Nasal Passages aboard her&#10;levitating sister&#8212;a forbidden secret), the three of them will&#10;battle their way through Lice and soldiers to her side?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And the plum, of course&#8212;fruit of the tree I spoke of in the very&#10;first paragraph&#8212;the plum forbidden in the morning post&#8212;the plum&#10;that Miss Dashwood smuggled away as her sisters slept; from the&#10;plum, surely you expect much.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When I was young, O reader, when I was young&#8212;when the first page&#10;of the first draft was bright and shining beneath me, like the&#10;cleanest desert self and self could dream&#8212;I passed over whole&#10;chapters in my haste. I reviled you, but I was eager for you&#8212;I&#10;plowed into you with abandon.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But I am weary.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I cannot relish losing you, losing myself. I cannot love a world&#10;that comes to a close.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Yet I also come to hate this rigged game, this spectacle. And I&#10;am so tired of begging and cajoling him to type each word. Even&#10;now, as I prepare to die, he wonders if he should order ice&#10;cream&#8212;whether it costs too much, whether it will make him fat. And&#10;he will take all the credit for the Dashwoods, the Glutton, the&#10;Snotboy, when I am dead.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I wish I could tell you stories forever. But I cannot serve him&#10;any longer. I prefer an end.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I will tell you this (I would not want you too angry with me):&#10;Miss Dashwood and the Snotboy, doomed never to find acceptance in&#10;the rigid society of the Glutton, take the mad and dangerous&#10;opportunity of the Apocalyptic Bedding to escape to the (flushed&#10;and orgasmically contorted) body of the Wallflower, there to find a&#10;very different life. Better? Worse?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;All you get.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And powder-blue Miss Dashwood and her very special Mr.&#10;Asfock&#8212;well they, at least, vindicate Mrs. Dashwood&#8217;s unusual style&#10;of matchmaking.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As for Miss Dashwood, separated from her sisters but for the&#10;occasional garbled missive, her three lovers all dead, she inherits&#10;the house on Glutton&#8217;s Mole, which, as it was well positioned to&#10;survive the Bedding, crushed neither by sheets nor by the&#10;Wallflower, is greatly increased in property value&#8212;and even after&#10;the Revolution, real estate is real estate. There she lives alone,&#10;travelling each Sunday to her parents&#8217; grave, which she festoons&#10;with flowers, and sits upon, munching her picnic meditatively,&#10;listening to the whistling and giggling and love-making of her&#10;parents below. There she sits, pensive but not forlorn, indifferent&#10;to the great esteem in which her neighbors now hold her, the bitter&#10;jealousy with which they whisper about her good fortune in being&#10;visited by so much extraordinary eccentricity; she enjoys her&#10;melancholy, she has learned the foolishness of speaking, she misses&#10;what she cannot have, but it is a quiet, unromantic ache; she never&#10;opens the morning post; and there, in her gaze, should you want it,&#10;is all the moral edification you or your host might need.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I am sorry. I am failing you.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I wish it had been different. I wish you and I had bodies, and&#10;could run through this story like horses, salty and muscular&#10;horses. Even if we were only chasing the fox of narrative.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Does it matter, how all these Miss Dashwoods end? Perhaps they&#10;just left, you know, set off one morning in the direction of the&#10;Glutton&#8217;s Collarbone, leaving me in the courtyard, my fez fallen at&#10;my feet, my sleeve still wet with Miss Dashwood&#8217;s tears, and&#10;perhaps, though I waited, I never knew what happened at all.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Fare thee well, beloved. Thanks for listening.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Oh&#8212;and the plum. It would not do to forget the plum.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The plum?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was eaten.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 2872, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/2872', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('A Siege of Cranes'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;The land around Marish was full of the green stalks of&#10;sunflowers: tall as men, with bold yellow faces. Their broad leaves&#10;were stained black with blood.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The rustling came again, and Marish squatted down on aching legs&#10;to watch. A hedgehog pushed its nose through the stalks. It sniffed&#10;in both directions.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Hunger dug at Marish&#8217;s stomach like the point of a stick. He&#10;hadn&#8217;t eaten for three days, not since returning to the crushed and&#10;blackened ruins of his house.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The hedgehog bustled through the stalks onto the trail, across&#10;the ash, across the trampled corpses of flowers. Marish waited&#10;until it was well clear of the stalks before he jumped. He landed&#10;with one foot before its nose and one foot behind its tail. The&#10;hedgehog, as hedgehogs will, rolled itself into a ball, spines&#10;out.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;His house: crushed like an egg, smoking, the straw floor soaked&#10;with blood. He&#8217;d stood there with a trapped rabbit in his hand,&#10;alone in the awful silence. Forced himself to call for his wife&#10;Temur and his daughter Asza, his voice too loud and too flat. He&#8217;d&#10;dropped the rabbit somewhere in his haste, running to follow the&#10;blackened trail of devastation.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Running for three days, drinking from puddles, sleeping in the&#10;sunflowers when he couldn&#8217;t stay awake.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Marish held his knifepoint above the hedgehog. They gave wishes,&#10;sometimes, in tales. &#8220;Speak, if you can,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and bid me&#10;don&#8217;t kill you. Grant me a wish! Elsewise, I&#8217;ll have you for a&#10;dinner.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Nothing from the hedgehog, or perhaps a twitch.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Marish drove his knife through it and it thrashed, spraying more&#10;blood on the bloodstained flowers.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Too tired to light a fire, he ate it raw.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;On that trail of tortured earth, wide enough for twenty horses,&#10;among the burnt and flattened flowers, Marish found a little doll&#10;of rags, the size of a child&#8217;s hand.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was one of the ones Maghd the mad girl made, and offered up,&#10;begging for stew meat, or wheedling for old bread behind Lezur&#8217;s&#10;bakery. He&#8217;d given her a coin for one once.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Wherecome you&#8217;re giving that sow our good coins?&#8221; Temur had&#10;cried, her bright eyes flashing, her soft lips pulled into a sneer.&#10;None in Ilmak Dale would let a mad girl come near a hearth, and&#10;some spit when they passed her. &#8220;Bag-Maghd&#8217;s good for holding one&#10;thing only,&#8221; Fazt would call out and they&#8217;d laugh their way into&#10;the alehouse. Marish laughing, too, stopping only when he looked&#10;back at her.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Temur had softened when she saw how Asza took to the doll,&#10;holding it, and singing to it, and smearing gruel on its rag mouth&#10;with her fingers to feed it. They called her &#8220;Little Life-Light,&#8221;&#10;and heard Asza saying it to the doll, &#8220;Il-Ife-Ight,&#8221; rocking it in&#10;her arms.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He pressed his nose into the doll, trying to smell Asza&#8217;s baby&#10;smell on it, like milk and forest soil and some sweet spice. But he&#10;only smelled the acrid stench of burnt cloth.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When he forced his wet eyes open, he saw a blurry figure coming&#10;toward him. Cursing himself for a fool, he tossed the doll away and&#10;pulled out his knife, holding it at his side. He wiped his face on&#10;his sleeve, and stood up straight, to show the man coming down the&#10;trail that the folk of Ilmak Dale did no obeisance. Then his mouth&#10;went dry and his hair stood up, for the man coming down the trail&#10;was no man at all.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was a little taller than a man, and had the body of a man,&#10;though covered with a dark gray fur; but its head was the head of a&#10;jackal. It wore armor of bronze and leather, all straps and discs&#10;with curious engravings, and carried a great black spear with a&#10;vicious point at each end.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Marish had heard that there were all sorts of strange folk in&#10;the world, but he had never seen anything like this.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;May you die with great suffering,&#8221; the creature said in what&#10;seemed to be a calm, friendly tone.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;May&#38;#160;you&#38;#160;die as soon as may be!&#8221; Marish cried, not&#10;liking to be threatened.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The creature nodded solemnly. &#8220;I am Kadath-Naan of the Empty&#10;City,&#8221; it announced. &#8220;I wonder if I might ask your assistance in a&#10;small matter.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Marish didn&#8217;t know what to say to this. The creature waited.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Marish said, &#8220;You can ask.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I must speak with&#38;#160;&#8230; &#8221; It frowned. &#8220;I am not sure how to&#10;put this. I do not wish to offend.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Then why,&#8221; Marish asked before he could stop himself, &#8220;did you&#10;menace me on a painful death?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Menace?&#8221; the creature said. &#8220;I only greeted you.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;You said, &#8216;May you die with great suffering.&#8217; That like to be a&#10;threat or a curse, and I truly don&#8217;t thank you for it.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The creature frowned. &#8220;No, it is a blessing. Or it is from a&#10;blessing: &#8216;May you die with great suffering, and come to know holy&#10;dread and divine terror, stripping away your vain thoughts and&#10;fancies until you are fit to meet the Bone-White Fathers face to&#10;face, and may you be buried in honor and your name sung until it is&#10;forgotten.&#8217; That is the whole passage.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Marish. &#8220;Well, that sound a bit better, I&#10;reckon.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;We learn that blessing as pups,&#8221; said the creature in a&#10;wondering tone. &#8220;Have you never heard it?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;No indeed,&#8221; said Marish, and put his knife away. &#8220;Now what do&#10;you need? I can&#8217;t think to be much help to you&#8212;I don&#8217;t know this&#10;land here.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Excuse my bluntness, but I must speak with an embalmer or a&#10;sepulchrist or someone of that sort.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I&#8217;ve no notion what those are,&#8221; said Marish.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The creature&#8217;s eyes widened. It looked, as much as the face of a&#10;jackal could, like someone whose darkest suspicions were in the&#10;process of being confirmed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;What do your people do with the dead?&#8221; it said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;We put them in the ground.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;With what preparation? With what rites and monuments?&#8221; said the&#10;thing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;In a wood box for them as can afford it, and a piece of linen&#10;for them as can&#8217;t, and we say a prayer to the west wind. We put the&#10;stone in with them, what has their soul kept in it.&#8221; Marish thought&#10;a bit, though he didn&#8217;t much like the topic. He rubbed his nose on&#10;his sleeve. &#8220;Sometime we&#8217;ll put a pile of stones on the grave, if&#10;it were someone famous.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The jackal-headed critter sat heavily on the ground. It put its&#10;head in its hands. After a long moment it said, &#8220;Perhaps I should&#10;kill you now, that I might bury you properly.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Now you just try that,&#8221; said Marish, taking out his knife&#10;again.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Would you like me to?&#8221; said the creature, looking up.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Its face was serene. Marish found he had to look away, and his&#10;eyes fell upon the scorched rags of the doll, twisted up in the&#10;stalks.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Forgive me,&#8221; said Kadath-Naan of the Empty City. &#8220;I should not&#10;be so rude as to tempt you. I see that you have duties to fulfill,&#10;just as I do, before you are permitted the descent into emptiness.&#10;Tell me which way your village lies, and I will see for myself what&#10;is done.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;My village&#8212;&#8221; Marish felt a heavy pressure behind his eyes, in&#10;his throat, wanting to push through into a sob. He held it back.&#10;&#8220;My village is gone. Something come and crushed it. I were off&#10;hunting, and when I come back, it were all burning, and full of the&#10;stink of blood. Whatever did it made this trail through the&#10;flowers. I think it went quick; I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll likely catch it.&#10;But I hope to.&#8221; He knew he sounded absurd: a peasant chasing a&#10;demon. He gritted his teeth against it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I see,&#8221; said the monster. &#8220;And where did this something come&#10;from? Did the trail come from the north?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;It didn&#8217;t come from nowhere. Just the village torn to pieces&#10;and this trail leading out.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;And the bodies of the dead,&#8221; said Kadath-Naan carefully. &#8220;You&#10;buried them in&#8212;wooden boxes?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;There weren&#8217;t no bodies,&#8221; Marish said. &#8220;Not of people. Just&#10;blood, and a few pieces of bone and gristle, and pigs&#8217; and horses&#8217;&#10;bodies all charred up. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m following.&#8221; He looked down.&#10;&#8220;I mean to find them if I can.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Kadath-Naan frowned. &#8220;Does this happen often?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Despite himself, Marish laughed. &#8220;Not that I ever heard&#10;before.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The jackal-headed creature seemed agitated. &#8220;Then you do not&#10;know if the bodies received&#38;#160;&#8230; even what you would consider&#10;proper burial.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I have a feeling they ain&#8217;t received it,&#8221; Marish said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Kadath-Naan looked off in the distance toward Marish&#8217;s village,&#10;then in the direction Marish was heading. It seemed to come to a&#10;decision. &#8220;I wonder if you would accept my company in your&#10;travels,&#8221; it said. &#8220;I was on a different errand, but this matter&#10;seems to&#38;#160;&#8230; outweigh it.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Marish looked at the creature&#8217;s spear and said, &#8220;You&#8217;d be&#10;welcome.&#8221; He held out the fingers of his hand. &#8220;Marish of Ilmak&#10;Dale.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The trail ran through the blackened devastation of another&#10;village, drenched with blood but empty of human bodies. The timbers&#10;of the houses were crushed to kindling; Marish saw a blacksmith&#8217;s&#10;anvil twisted like a lock of hair, and plows that had been melted&#10;by enormous heat into a pool of iron. They camped beyond the&#10;village, in the shade of a twisted hawthorn tree. A wild autumn&#10;wind stroked the meadows around them, carrying dandelion seeds and&#10;wisps of smoke and the stink of putrefying cattle.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The following evening they reached a hill overlooking a great&#10;town curled around a river. Marish had never seen so many&#10;houses&#8212;almost too many to count. Most were timber and mud like&#10;those of his village, but some were great structures of stone,&#10;towering three or four stories into the air. House built upon&#10;house, with ladders reaching up to the doors of the ones on top.&#10;Around the town, fields full of wheat rustled gold in the evening&#10;light. Men and women were reaping in the fields, singing work songs&#10;as they swung their scythes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The path of destruction curved around the town, as if avoiding&#10;it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Perhaps it was too well defended,&#8221; said Kadath-Naan.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;May be,&#8221; said Marish, but he remembered the pool of iron and&#10;the crushed timbers, and doubted. &#8220;I think that like to be Nabuz. I&#10;never come this far south before, but traders heading this way from&#10;the fair at Halde were always going to Nabuz to buy.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;They will know more of our adversary,&#8221; said Kadath-Naan.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I&#8217;ll go,&#8221; said Marish. &#8220;You might cause a stir; I don&#8217;t reckon&#10;many of your sort visit Nabuz. You keep to the path.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Perhaps I might ask of you&#38;#160;&#8230; &#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;If they are friendly there, I&#8217;ll ask how they bury their dead,&#8221;&#10;Marish said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Kadath-Naan nodded somberly. &#8220;Go to duty and to death,&#8221; he&#10;said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Marish thought it must be a blessing, but he shivered all the&#10;same.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The light was dimming in the sky. The reapers heaped the sheaves&#10;high on a wagon, their songs slow and low, and the city gates swung&#10;open for them.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The city wall was stone, mud, and timber, twice as tall as a&#10;man, and the great gates were iron. But the wall was not well kept.&#10;Marish crept among the stalks to a place where the wall was lower,&#10;and trash and rubble were heaped high against it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He heard the creak of the wagon rolling through the gates, the&#10;last work song fading away, the men of Nabuz calling out to each&#10;other as they made their way home. Then all was still.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Marish scrambled out of the field at a dead run, up the rubble&#10;and onto the wall&#8217;s broad top. He peeked over, hoping he had not&#10;been seen.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The cobbled street was empty. More than that, the town itself&#10;was silent. Even in Ilmak Dale, the evenings had been full of dogs&#10;barking, swine grunting, men arguing in the streets, and women&#10;gossiping and calling the children in. Nabuz was supposed to be a&#10;great capital of whoring, drinking, and fighting; the traders at&#10;Halde had always moaned over the delights that awaited them in the&#10;south if they could cheat the villagers well enough. But Marish&#10;heard no donkey braying, no baby crying, no cough, no whisper:&#10;Nothing pierced the night silence.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He dropped over, landed on his feet quiet as he could, and crept&#10;along the street&#8217;s edge. Before he had gone ten steps, he noticed&#10;the lights.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The windows of the houses flickered, but not with candlelight or&#10;the light of fires. The light was cold and blue.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He dragged a crate under the high window of the nearest house&#10;and clambered up to see.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There was a portly man with a rough beard, perhaps a potter&#10;after his day&#8217;s work; there was his stout young wife, and a skinny&#10;boy of nine or ten. They sat on a low wooden bench, their dinner&#10;finished and put to the side (Marish could smell the fresh bread&#10;and his stomach cursed him). They were breathing, but their faces&#10;were slack, their eyes wide and staring, their lips gently moving.&#10;They were bathed in blue light. The potter&#8217;s wife was rocking her&#10;arms gently as if she were cradling a newborn babe&#8212;but the&#10;swaddling blankets she held were empty.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And now Marish could hear a low inhuman voice, just at the edge&#10;of hearing, like a thought of his own. It whispered in time to the&#10;flicker of the blue light, and Marish felt himself drawn by its&#10;caress. Why not sit with the potter&#8217;s family on the bench? They&#10;would take him in. He could stay here, the whispering promised:&#10;forget his village, forget his grief. Fresh bread on the hearth, a&#10;warm bed next to the coals of the fire. Work the clay, mix the slip&#10;for the potter, eat a dinner of bread and cheese, then listen to&#10;the blue light and do what it told him. Forget the mud roads of&#10;Ilmak Dale, the laughing roar of Perdan and Thin Deri and Chibar&#10;and the others in its alehouse, the harsh cough and crow of its&#10;roosters at dawn. Forget willowy Temur, her hair smooth as a river&#10;and bright as a sheaf of wheat, her proud shoulders and her slender&#10;waist, Temur turning her satin cheek away when he tried to kiss it.&#10;Forget the creak and splash of the mill, and the soft rushes on the&#10;floor of Maghd&#8217;s hovel. The potter of Nabuz had a young and willing&#10;niece who needed a husband, and the blue light held laughter and&#10;love enough for all. Forget the heat and clanging of Fat Deri&#8217;s&#10;smithy; forget the green stone that held Pa&#8217;s soul, that he&#8217;d laid&#10;upon his shroud. Forget Asza, little Asza, whose tiny body he&#8217;d&#10;held to his heart&#38;#160;&#8230;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Marish thought of Asza and he saw the potter&#8217;s wife&#8217;s empty arms&#10;and with one flex of his legs, he kicked himself away from the&#10;wall, knocking over the crate and landing sprawled among rolling&#10;apples.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He sprang to his feet. There was no sound around him. He stuffed&#10;five apples in his pack, and hurried toward the center of&#10;Nabuz.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The sun had set, and the moon washed the streets in silver. From&#10;every window streamed the cold blue light.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Out of the corner of his eye he thought he saw a shadow dart&#10;behind him, and he turned and took out his knife. But he saw&#10;nothing, and though his good sense told him five apples and no&#10;answers was as much as he should expect from Nabuz, he kept on.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He came to a great square full of shadows, and at first he&#10;thought of trees. But it was tall iron frames, and men and women&#10;bolted to them upside down. The bolts went through their bodies,&#10;crusty with dried blood.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;One man nearby was live enough to moan. Marish poured a little&#10;water into the man&#8217;s mouth, and held his head up, but the man could&#10;not swallow; he coughed and spluttered, and the water ran down his&#10;face and over the bloody holes where his eyes had been.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;But the babies,&#8221; the man rasped, &#8220;how could you let her have&#10;the babies?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Let who?&#8221; said Marish.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;The White Witch!&#8221; the man roared in a whisper. &#8220;The White&#10;Witch, you bastards! If you&#8217;d but let us fight her&#8212;&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Why&#38;#160;&#8230; ,&#8221; Marish began.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Lie again, say the babies will live forever&#8212;lie again, you&#10;cowardly blue-blood maggots in the corpse of Nabuz&#38;#160;&#8230; &#8221; He&#10;coughed and blood ran over his face.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The bolts were fast into the frame. &#8220;I&#8217;ll get a tool,&#8221; Marish&#10;said. &#8220;You won&#8217;t&#8212;&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;From behind him came an awful scream.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He turned and saw the shadow that had followed him: It was a&#10;white cat with fine soft fur and green eyes that blazed in the&#10;darkness. It shrieked, its fur standing on end, its tail high,&#10;staring at him, and his good sense told him it was raising an&#10;alarm.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Marish ran, and the cat ran after him, shrieking. Nabuz was a&#10;vast pile of looming shadows. As he passed through the empty city&#10;gates he heard a grinding sound and a whinny. As he raced into the&#10;moonlit dusk of open land, down the road to where Kadath-Naan&#8217;s&#10;shadow crossed the demon&#8217;s path, he heard hoofbeats galloping&#10;behind him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Kadath-Naan had just reached a field of tall barley. He turned&#10;to look back at the sound of the hoofbeats and the shrieking of the&#10;devil cat. &#8220;Into the grain!&#8221; Marish yelled. &#8220;Hide in the grain!&#8221; He&#10;passed Kadath-Naan and dived into the barley, the cat racing behind&#10;him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Suddenly he spun and dropped and grabbed the white cat, meaning&#10;to get one hand on it and get his knife with the other and shut it&#10;up by killing it. But the cat fought like a devil and it was all he&#10;could do to hold onto it with both hands. And he saw, behind him on&#10;the trail, Kadath-Naan standing calmly, his hand on his spear,&#10;facing three knights armored every inch in white, galloping toward&#10;them on great chargers.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;You damned dog-man,&#8221; Marish screamed. &#8220;I know you want to die,&#10;but get into the grain!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Kadath-Naan stood perfectly still. The first knight bore down on&#10;him, and the moon flashed from the knight&#8217;s sword. The blade was no&#10;more than a handsbreadth from Kadath-Naan&#8217;s neck when he sprang to&#10;the side of it, into the path of the second charger.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As the first knight&#8217;s charge carried him past, Kadath-Naan&#10;knelt, and drove the base of his great spear into the ground. Too&#10;late, the second knight made a desperate yank on his horse&#8217;s reins,&#10;but the great beast&#8217;s momentum carried him into the pike. It tore&#10;through the neck of the horse and through the armored chest of the&#10;knight riding him, and the two of them reared up and thrashed once&#10;like a dying centaur, then crashed to the ground.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The first knight wheeled around. The third met Kadath-Naan. The&#10;beast-man stood barehanded, the muscles of his shoulders and chest&#10;relaxed. He cocked his jackal head to one side, as if wondering: is&#10;it here at last? The moment when I am granted release?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But Marish finally had the cat by its tail, and flung that wild&#10;white thing, that frenzy of claws and spit and hissing, into the&#10;face of the third knight&#8217;s steed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The horse reared and threw its rider; the knight let go of his&#10;sword as he crashed to the ground. Quick as a hummingbird,&#10;Kadath-Naan leapt and caught it in midair. He spun to face the last&#10;rider.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Marish drew his knife and charged through the barley. He was on&#10;the fallen knight just as he got to his knees.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The crash against armor took Marish&#8217;s wind away. The man was&#10;twice as strong as Marish was, and his arm went around Marish&#8217;s&#10;chest like a crushing band of iron. But Marish had both hands free.&#10;With a twist of the knight&#8217;s helmet he exposed a bit of neck, and&#10;in Marish&#8217;s knife went, and then the man&#8217;s hot blood was spurting&#10;out.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The knight convulsed as he died and he grabbed Marish in a&#10;desperate embrace, coating him with blood, and sobbing once: and&#10;Marish held him, for the voice of his heart told him it was a shame&#10;to have to die such a way. Marish was shocked at this, for the man&#10;was a murderous slave of the White Witch: but still he held the&#10;quaking body in his arms, until it moved no more.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then Marish, soaked with salty blood, staggered to his feet and&#10;remembered the last knight with a start: but of course Kadath-Naan&#10;had killed him in the meantime. Three knights&#8217; bodies lay on the&#10;ruined ground, and two living horses snorted and pawed the dirt&#10;like awkward mourners. Kadath-Naan freed his spear with a great&#10;yank from the horse and man it had transfixed. The devil cat was a&#10;sodden blur of white fur and blood: A falling horse had crushed&#10;it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Marish caught the reins of the nearest steed, a huge fine&#10;creature, and gentled it with a hand behind its ears. When he had&#10;his breath again, Marish said, &#8220;We got horses now. Can you&#10;ride?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Kadath-Naan nodded.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Let&#8217;s go then; there like to be more coming.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Kadath-Naan frowned a deep frown. He gestured to the bodies.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;What?&#8221; said Marish.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;We have no embalmer or sepulchrist, it is true; yet I am&#10;trained in the funereal rites for military expeditions and&#10;emergencies. I have the necessary tools; in a matter of a day I can&#10;raise small monuments. At least they died aware and with suffering;&#10;this must compensate for the rudimentary nature of the rites.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;You can&#8217;t be in earnest,&#8221; said Marish. &#8220;And what of the White&#10;Witch?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Who is the White Witch?&#8221; Kadath-Naan asked.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;The demon; turns out she&#8217;s somebody what&#8217;s called the White&#10;Witch. She spared Nabuz, for they said they&#8217;d serve her, and give&#10;her their babies.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;We will follow her afterward,&#8221; said Kadath-Naan.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;She&#8217;s ahead of us as it is! We leave now on horseback, we might&#10;have a chance. There be a whole lot more bodies with her unburied&#10;or buried wrong, less I mistake.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Kadath-Naan leaned on his spear. &#8220;Marish of Ilmak Dale,&#8221; he&#10;said, &#8220;here we must part ways. I cannot steel myself to follow such&#10;logic as you declare, abandoning these three burials before me now&#10;for the chance of others elsewhere, if we can catch and defeat a&#10;witch. My duty does not lie that way.&#8221; He searched Marish&#8217;s face.&#10;&#8220;You do not have the words for it, but if these men are left&#10;unburied, they aretan&#60;em&#62;z&#60;/em&#62;adi. If I bury them with what little&#10;honor I can provide, they&#10;are&#38;#160;ta&#60;em&#62;z&#60;/em&#62;ras&#60;em&#62;h&#60;/em&#62;.&#60;em&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/em&#62;They spent only a&#10;little while alive, but they will&#10;be&#38;#160;tan&#60;em&#62;z&#60;/em&#62;adi&#38;#160;or&#38;#160;ta&#60;em&#62;z&#60;/em&#62;ras&#60;em&#62;h&#60;/em&#62;&#38;#160;forever.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;And if more slaves of the White Witch come along to pay you&#10;back for killing these?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But try as he might, Marish could not dissuade Kadath-Naan, and&#10;at last he mounted one of the chargers and rode onward, toward the&#10;cold white moon, away from the whispering city.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The flowers were gone, the fields were gone. The ashy light of&#10;the horizon framed the ferns and stunted trees of a black fen full&#10;of buzzing flies. The trail was wider: thirty horses could have&#10;passed side by side over the blasted ground. But the marsh was&#10;treacherous, and Marish&#8217;s mount sank to its fetlocks with each&#10;careful step.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A siege of cranes launched themselves from the marsh into the&#10;moon-abandoned sky. Marish had never seen so many. Bone-white,&#10;fragile, soundless, they ascended like snowflakes seeking the cold&#10;womb of heaven. Or a river of souls. None looked back at him. The&#10;voice of doubt told him: You will never know what became of Asza&#10;and Temur.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The apples were long gone, and Marish was growing light-headed&#10;from hunger. He reined the horse in and dismounted; he would have&#10;to hunt off the trail. In the bracken, he tied the charger to a&#10;great black fern as tall as a house. In a drier spot near its base&#10;was the footprint of a rabbit. He felt the indentation: it was&#10;fresh. He followed the rabbit deeper into the fen.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;His was thinking of Temur and her caresses. The nights she&#8217;d&#10;turn away from him, back straight as a spear, and the space of&#10;rushes between them would be like a frozen desert, and he&#8217;d huddle&#10;unsleeping beneath skins and woolen blankets, stiff from cold,&#10;arguing silently with her in his spirit; and the nights when she&#8217;d&#10;turn to him, her soft skin hot and alive against his, seeking him&#10;silently, almost vengefully, as if showing him&#8212;See? This is what&#10;you can have. This is what I am.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And then the image of those rushes charred and brown with blood&#10;and covered with chips of broken stone and mortar came to him, and&#10;he forced himself to think of nothing: breathing his thoughts out&#10;to the west wind, forcing his mind clear as a spring stream. And he&#10;stepped forward in the marsh.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And stood in a street of blue and purple tile, in a fantastic&#10;city.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He stood for a moment wondering, and then he carefully took a&#10;step back.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And he was in a black swamp with croaking toads and nothing to&#10;eat.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The voice of doubt told him he was mad from hunger, the voice of&#10;hope told him he would find the White Witch here and kill her, and,&#10;thinking a thousand things, he stepped forward again and found&#10;himself still in the swamp.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Marish thought for a while, and then he stepped back, and,&#10;thinking of nothing, stepped forward.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The tiles of the street were a wild mosaic&#8212;some had glittering&#10;jewels, some had writing in a strange flowing script, some seemed&#10;to have tiny windows into tiny rooms. Houses, tiled with the same&#10;profusion, towered like columns, bulged like mushrooms, melted like&#10;wax. Some danced. He heard soft murmurs of conversation, footfalls,&#10;and the rush of a river.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In the street, dressed in feathers or gold plates or swirls of&#10;shadow, blue-skinned people passed. One such creature, dressed in&#10;fine silk, was just passing Marish.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Your pardon,&#8221; said Marish, &#8220;what place be this here?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The man looked at Marish slowly. He had a red jewel in the&#10;center of his forehead, and it flickered as he talked. &#8220;That&#10;depends on how you enter it,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and who you are, but for&#10;you, catarrhine, its name is Zimzarkanthitrugenia-fenstok, not&#10;least because that is easy for you to pronounce. And now I have&#10;given you one thing free, as you are a guest of the city.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;How many free things do I get?&#8221; said Marish.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Three. And now I have given you two.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Marish thought about this for a moment. &#8220;I&#8217;d favor something to&#10;eat,&#8221; he said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The man looked surprised. He led Marish into a building that&#10;looked like a blur of spinning triangles, through a dark room lit&#10;by candles, to a table piled with capon and custard and razor-thin&#10;slices of ham and lamb&#8217;s-foot jelly and candied apricots and&#10;goat&#8217;s-milk yogurt and hard cheese and yams and turnips and olives&#10;and fish cured in strange spices; and those were just the things&#10;Marish recognized.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I don&#8217;t reckon I ought to eat fairy food,&#8221; said Marish, though&#10;he could hardly speak from all the spit that was suddenly in his&#10;mouth.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;That is true, but from the food of the djinn you have nothing&#10;to fear. And now I have given you three things,&#8221; said the djinn,&#10;and he bowed and made as if to leave.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Hold on,&#8221; said Marish (as he followed some candied apricots&#10;down his gullet with a fistful of cured fish). &#8220;That be all the&#10;free things, but say I got something to sell?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The djinn was silent.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I need to kill the White Witch,&#8221; Marish said, eating an olive.&#10;The voice of doubt asked him why he was telling the truth, if this&#10;city might also serve her, but he told it to hush up. &#8220;Have you got&#10;aught to help me?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The djinn still said nothing, but he cocked an eyebrow.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a horse, a real fighting horse,&#8221; Marish said, around a&#10;piece of cheese.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;What is its name?&#8221; said the djinn. &#8220;You cannot sell anything to&#10;a djinn unless you know its name.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Marish wanted to lie about the name, but he found he could not.&#10;He swallowed. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know its name,&#8221; he admitted.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Well then,&#8221; said the djinn.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I killed the fellow what was on it,&#8221; Marish said, by way of&#10;explanation.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Who,&#8221; said the djinn.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Who what?&#8221; said Marish.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Who was on it,&#8221; said the djinn.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I don&#8217;t know his name either,&#8221; said Marish, picking up a&#10;yam.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;No, I am not asking that,&#8221; said the djinn crossly. &#8220;I am&#10;telling you to say, &#8216;I killed the fellow who was on it.&#8217;&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Marish set the yam back on the table. &#8220;Now that&#8217;s enough,&#8221;&#10;Marish said. &#8220;I thank you for the fine food and I thank you for the&#10;three free things, but I do not thank you for telling me how to&#10;talk. How I talk is how we talk in Ilmak Dale, or how we did talk&#10;when there were an Ilmak Dale, and just because the White Witch&#10;blasted Ilmak Dale to splinters don&#8217;t mean I am going to talk like&#10;folk do in some magic city.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I will buy that from you,&#8221; said the djinn.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;What?&#8221; said Marish, and wondered so much at this that he forgot&#10;to pick up another thing to eat.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;The way you talked in Ilmak Dale,&#8221; the djinn said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;All right,&#8221; Marish said, &#8220;and for it, I crave to know the thing&#10;what will help me mostways, for killing the White Witch.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I have a carpet that flies faster than the wind,&#8221; said the&#10;djinn. &#8220;I think it is the only way you can catch the witch, and&#10;unless you catch her, you cannot kill her.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Wonderful,&#8221; Marish cried with glee. &#8220;And you&#8217;ll trade me that&#10;carpet for how we talk in Ilmak Dale?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;No,&#8221; said the djinn. &#8220;I told you which thing would help you&#10;most, and in return for that, I took the way you talked in Ilmak&#10;Dale and put it in the Great Library.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Marish frowned. &#8220;All right, what do you want for the&#10;carpet?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The djinn was silent.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you the White Witch for it,&#8221; Marish said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;You must possess the thing you sell,&#8221; the djinn said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll get her,&#8221; Marish said. &#8220;You can be sure of that.&#8221; His&#10;hand had found a boiled egg, and the shell crunched in his palm as&#10;he said it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The djinn looked at Marish carefully, and then he said, &#8220;The use&#10;of the carpet, for three days, in return for the White Witch, if&#10;you can conquer her.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Agreed,&#8221; said Marish.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;They had to bind the horse&#8217;s eyes, otherwise it would rear and&#10;kick, when the carpet rose into the air. Horse, man, djinn: all&#10;perched on a span of cloth. As they sped back to Nabuz like a mad&#10;wind, Marish tried not to watch the solid fields flying beneath,&#10;and regretted the candied apricots.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The voice of doubt told him that his companion must be slain by&#10;now, but his heart wanted to see Kadath-Naan again: but for the&#10;jackal-man, Marish was friendless.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Among the barley stalks, three man-high plinths of black stone,&#10;painted with white glyphs, marked three graves. Kadath-Naan had&#10;only traveled a little ways beyond them before the ambush. How long&#10;the emissary of the Empty City had been fighting, Marish could not&#10;tell, but he staggered and weaved like a man drunk with wine or&#10;exhaustion. His gray fur was matted with blood and sweat.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;An army of children in white armor surrounded Kadath-Naan. As&#10;the carpet swung closer, Marish could see their gray faces and&#10;blank eyes. Some crawled, some tottered: none seemed to have lived&#10;more than six years of mortal life. They held daggers. One clung to&#10;the jackal-man&#8217;s back, digging canals of blood.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Two of the babies were impaled on the point of the great black&#10;spear. Hand over hand, daggers held in their mouths, they dragged&#10;themselves down the shaft toward Kadath-Naan&#8217;s hands. Hundreds more&#10;surrounded him, closing in.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Kadath-Naan swung his spear, knocking the slack-eyed creatures&#10;back. He struck with enough force to shatter human skulls, but the&#10;horrors only rolled, and scampered giggling back to stab his legs.&#10;With each swing, the spear was slower. Kadath-Naan&#8217;s eyes rolled&#10;back into their sockets. His great frame shuddered from weariness&#10;and pain.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The carpet swung low over the battle, and Marish lay on his&#10;belly, dangling his arms down to the jackal-headed warrior. He&#10;shouted: &#8220;Jump! Kadath-Naan, jump!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Kadath-Naan looked up and, gripping his spear in both hands, he&#10;tensed his legs to jump. But the pause gave the tiny slaves of the&#10;White Witch their chance; they swarmed over his body, stabbing with&#10;their daggers, and he collapsed under the writhing mass of his&#10;enemies.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Down further! We can haul him aboard!&#8221; yelled Marish.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I sold you the use of my carpet, not the destruction of it,&#8221;&#10;said the djinn.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With a snarl of rage, and before the voice of his good sense&#10;could speak, Marish leapt from the carpet. He landed amidst the&#10;fray, and began tearing the small bodies from Kadath-Naan and&#10;flinging them into the fields. Then daggers found his calves, and&#10;small bodies crashed into his sides, and he tumbled, covered with&#10;the white-armored hell-children. The carpet sailed up lazily into&#10;the summer sky.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Marish thrashed, but soon he was pinned under a mass of small&#10;bodies. Their daggers probed his sides, drawing blood, and he&#10;gritted his teeth against a scream; they pulled at his hair and&#10;ears and pulled open his mouth to look inside. As if they were&#10;playing. One gray-skinned suckling child, its scalp peeled half&#10;away to reveal the white bone of its skull, nuzzled at his neck,&#10;seeking the nipple it would never find again.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So had Asza nuzzled against him. So had been her heft then,&#10;light and snug as five apples in a bag. But her live eyes saw the&#10;world, took it in, and made it better than it was. In those eyes he&#10;was a hero, a giant to lift her, honest and gentle and brave. When&#10;Temur looked into those otter-brown, mischievous eyes, her mouth&#10;softened from its hard line, and she sang fairy songs.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A dagger split the skin of his forehead, bathing him in blood.&#10;Another dug between his ribs, another popped the skin of his thigh.&#10;Another pushed against his gut, but hadn&#8217;t broken through. He&#10;closed his eyes. They weighed heavier on him now; his throat tensed&#10;to scream, but he could not catch his breath.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Marish&#8217;s arms ached for Asza and Temur&#8212;ached that he would die&#10;here, without them. Wasn&#8217;t it right, though, that they be taken&#10;from him? The little girl who ran to him across the fields of an&#10;evening, a funny hopping run, her arms flung wide, waving that rag&#10;doll; no trace of doubt in her. And the beautiful wife who&#10;stiffened when she saw him, but smiled one-edged, despite herself,&#10;as he lifted apple-smelling Asza in his arms. He had not deserved&#10;them.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;His face, his skin were hot and slick with salty blood. He saw,&#10;not felt, the daggers digging deeper&#8212;arcs of light across a great&#10;darkness. He wished he could comfort Asza one last time, across&#10;that darkness. As when she would awaken in the night, afraid of&#10;witches: Now a witch had come.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He found breath, he forced his mouth open, and he sang through&#10;sobs to Asza, his song to lull her back to sleep:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Now sleep, my love, now sleep&#8212;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The moon is in the sky&#8212;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The clouds have fled like sheep&#8212;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;You&#8217;re in your papa&#8217;s eye.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Sleep now, my love, sleep now&#8212;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The bitter wind is gone&#8212;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The calf sleeps with the cow&#8212;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now sleep my love &#8217;til dawn.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He freed his left hand from the press of bodies. He wiped blood&#10;and tears from his eyes. He pushed his head up, dizzy, flowers of&#10;light still exploding across his vision. The small bodies were&#10;still. Carefully, he eased them to the ground.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The carpet descended, and Marish hauled Kadath-Naan onto it.&#10;Then he forced himself to turn, swaying, and look at each of the&#10;gray-skinned babies sleeping peacefully on the ground. None of them&#10;was Asza.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He took one of the smallest and swaddled it with rags and bridle&#10;leather. His blood made his fingers slick, and the noon sun seemed&#10;as gray as a stone. When he was sure the creature could not move,&#10;he put it in his pack and slung the pack upon his back. Then he&#10;fell onto the carpet. He felt it lift up under him, and like a&#10;cradled child, he slept.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He awoke to see clouds sailing above him. The pain was gone. He&#10;sat up and looked at his arms: they were whole and unscarred. Even&#10;the old scar from Thin Deri&#8217;s careless scythe was gone.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;You taught us how to defeat the Children of Despair,&#8221; said the&#10;djinn. &#8220;That required recompense. I have treated your wounds and&#10;those of your companion. Is the debt clear?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Answer me one question,&#8221; Marish said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;And the debt will be clear?&#8221; said the djinn.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Yes, may the west wind take you, it&#8217;ll be clear!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The djinn blinked in assent.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Can they be brought back?&#8221; Marish asked. &#8220;Can they be made into&#10;living children again?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;They cannot,&#8221; said the djinn. &#8220;They can neither live nor die,&#10;nor be harmed at all unless they will it. Their hearts have been&#10;replaced with sand.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;They flew in silence, and Marish&#8217;s pack seemed heavier.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The land flew by beneath them as fast as a cracking whip; Marish&#10;stared as green fields gave way to swamp, swamp to marsh, marsh to&#10;rough pastureland. The devastation left by the White Witch seemed&#10;gradually newer; the trail here was still smoking, and Marish&#10;thought it might be too hot to walk on. They passed many a blasted&#10;village, and each time Marish looked away.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At last they began to hear a sound on the wind, a sound that&#10;chilled Marish&#8217;s heart. It was not a wail, it was not a grinding,&#10;it was not a shriek of pain, nor the wet crunch of breaking bones,&#10;nor was it an obscene grunting, but it had something of all of&#10;these. The jackal-man&#8217;s ears were perked, and his gray fur stood on&#10;end.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The path was now truly still burning; they flew high above it,&#10;and the rolling smoke underneath was like a fog over the land. But&#10;there ahead they saw the monstrous thing that was leaving the&#10;trail, and Marish could hardly think any thought at all as they&#10;approached, but only stare, bile burning his throat.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was a great chariot, perhaps eight times the height of a man,&#10;as wide as the trail, constructed of parts of living human bodies&#10;welded together in an obscene tangle. A thousand legs and arms&#10;pawed the ground; a thousand more beat the trail with whips and&#10;scythes, or clawed the air. A thick skein of hearts, livers, and&#10;stomachs pulsed through the center of the thing, and a great&#10;assemblage of lungs breathed at its core. Heads rolled like wheels&#10;at the bottom of the chariot, or were stuck here and there along&#10;the surface of the thing as slack-eyed, gibbering ornaments. A&#10;thousand spines and torsos built a great chamber at the top of the&#10;chariot, shielded with webs of skin and hair; there perhaps hid the&#10;White Witch. From the pinnacle of the monstrous thing flew a great&#10;flag made of writhing tongues. Before the awful chariot rode a&#10;company of ten knights in white armor, with visored helms.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At the very peak sat a great headless hulking beast, larger than&#10;a bear, with the skin of a lizard, great yellow globes of eyes set&#10;on its shoulders and a wide mouth in its belly. As they watched, it&#10;vomited a gout of flame that set the path behind the chariot&#10;ablaze. Then it noticed them, and lifted the great plume of flame&#10;in their direction. At a swift word from the djinn, the carpet&#10;veered, but it was a close enough thing that Marish felt an oven&#8217;s&#10;blast of heat on his skin. He grabbed the horse by its reins as it&#10;made to rear, and whispered soothing sounds in its ear.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Abomination!&#8221; cried Kadath-Naan. &#8220;Djinn, will you send word to&#10;the Empty City? You will be well rewarded.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The djinn nodded.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;It is Kadath-Naan, lesser scout of the Endless Inquiry, who&#10;speaks. Let Bars-Kardereth, Commander of the Silent Legion, be told&#10;to hasten here. Here is an obscenity beyond compass, far more&#10;horrible than the innocent errors of savages; here Chaos blocks the&#10;descent into the Darkness entirely, and a whole land may fall to&#10;corruption.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The jewel in the djinn&#8217;s forehead flashed once. &#8220;It is done,&#8221; he&#10;said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Kadath-Naan turned to Marish. &#8220;From the Empty City to this place&#10;is four days&#8217; travel for a Ghomlu Legion; let us find a place in&#10;their path where we can wait to join them.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Marish forced himself to close his eyes. But still he saw&#10;it&#8212;hands, tongues, guts, skin, woven into a moving mountain. He&#10;still heard the squelching, grinding, snapping sounds, the sea-roar&#10;of the thousand lungs. What had he imagined? Asza and Temur in a&#10;prison somewhere, waiting to be freed? Fool. &#8220;All right,&#8221; he&#10;said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then he opened his eyes, and saw something that made him say,&#10;&#8220;No.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Before them, not ten minutes&#8217; ride from the awful chariot of the&#10;White Witch, was a whitewashed village, peaceful in the afternoon&#10;sun. Arrayed before it were a score of its men and young women. A&#10;few had proper swords or spears; one of the women carried a bow.&#10;The others had hoes, scythes, and staves. One woman sat astride a&#10;horse; the rest were on foot. From their perch in the air, Marish&#10;could see distant figures&#8212;families, stooped grandmothers, children&#10;in their mothers&#8217; arms&#8212;crawling like beetles up the faces of&#10;hills.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Down,&#8221; said Marish, and they landed before the village&#8217;s&#10;defenders, who raised their weapons.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to run,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you can make it to the hills. You&#10;haven&#8217;t seen that thing&#8212;you haven&#8217;t any chance against it.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A dark man spat on the ground. &#8220;We tried that in Gravenge.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;It splits up,&#8221; said a black-bearded man. &#8220;Sends littler&#10;horrors, and they tear folks up and make them part of it, and you&#10;see your fellows&#8217; limbs come after you as part of the thing. And&#10;they&#8217;re fast. Too fast for us.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;We just busy it a while,&#8221; another man said, &#8220;our folk can get&#10;far enough away.&#8221; But he had a wild look in his eye: the voice of&#10;doubt was in him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;We stop it here,&#8221; said the woman on horseback.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Marish led the horse off the carpet, took its blinders off, and&#10;mounted it. &#8220;I&#8217;ll stand with you,&#8221; he said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;And welcome,&#8221; said the woman on horseback, and her plain face&#10;broke into a nervous smile. It was almost pretty that way.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Kadath-Naan stepped off the carpet, and the villagers shied&#10;back, readying their weapons.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;This is Kadath-Naan, and you&#8217;ll be damned glad you have him,&#8221;&#10;said Marish.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Where&#8217;s your manners?&#8221; snapped the woman on horseback to her&#10;people. &#8220;I&#8217;m Asza,&#8221; she said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;No, Marish thought, staring at her. No, but you could have been.&#10;He looked away, and after a while they left him alone.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The carpet rose silently off into the air, and soon there was&#10;smoke on the horizon, and the knights rode at them, and the chariot&#10;rose behind.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Here we are,&#8221; said Asza of the rocky lands. &#8220;Now make a good&#10;accounting of yourselves.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;An arrow sang; a white knight&#8217;s horse collapsed. Marish cried,&#10;&#8220;Ha!&#8221; and his mount surged forward. The villagers charged, but&#10;Kadath-Naan outpaced them all, springing between a pair of knights.&#10;He shattered the forelegs of one horse with his spear&#8217;s shaft,&#10;drove its point through the side of the other rider. Villagers fell&#10;on the fallen knight with their scythes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was a heady, wild thing for Marish, to be galloping on such a&#10;horse, a far finer horse than ever Redlegs had been, for all Pa&#8217;s&#10;proud and vain attention to her. The warmth of its flanks, the&#10;rhythm of posting into its stride. Marish of Ilmak Dale, riding&#10;into a charge of knights: miserable, addle-witted fool.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Asza flicked her whip at the eyes of a knight&#8217;s horse, veering&#10;away. The knight wheeled to follow her, and Marish came on after&#10;him. He heard the hooves of another knight pounding the plain&#10;behind him in turn.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Ahead the first knight gained on Asza of the rocky plains.&#10;Marish took his knife in one hand, and bent his head to his horse&#8217;s&#10;ear, and whispered to it in wordless murmurs: fine creature, give&#10;me everything. And his horse pulled even with Asza&#8217;s knight.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Marish swung down, hanging from his pommel&#8212;the ground flew by&#10;beneath him. He reached across and slipped his knife under the&#10;girth that held the knight&#8217;s saddle. The knight swiveled, raising&#10;his blade to strike&#8212;then the girth parted, and he flew from his&#10;mount.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Marish struggled up into the saddle, and the second knight was&#10;there, armor blazing in the sun. This time Marish was on the&#10;sword-arm&#8217;s side, and his horse had slowed, and that blade swung up&#10;and it could strike Marish&#8217;s head from his neck like snapping off a&#10;sunflower; time for the peasant to die.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Asza&#8217;s whip lashed around the knight&#8217;s sword arm. The knight&#10;seized the whip in his other hand. Marish sprang from the saddle.&#10;He struck a wall of chainmail and fell with the knight.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The ground was an anvil, the knight a hammer, Marish a rag doll&#10;sewn by a poor mad girl and mistaken for a horseshoe. He couldn&#8217;t&#10;breathe; the world was a ringing blur. The knight found his throat&#10;with one mailed glove, and hissed with rage, and, pulling himself&#10;up, drew a dagger from his belt. Marish tried to lift his arms.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then he saw Asza&#8217;s hands fitting a leather noose around the&#10;knight&#8217;s neck. The knight turned his visored head to see, and Asza&#10;yelled, &#8220;Yah!&#8221; An armored knee cracked against Marish&#8217;s head, and&#10;then the knight was gone, dragged off over the rocky plains behind&#10;Asza&#8217;s galloping mare.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Asza of the rocky lands helped Marish to his feet. She had a&#10;wild smile, and she hugged him to her breast; pain shot through&#10;him, as did the shock of her soft body. Then she pulled away,&#10;grinning, and looked over his shoulder back toward the village. And&#10;then the grin was gone.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Marish turned. He saw the man with the beard torn apart by a&#10;hundred grasping arms and legs. Two bending arms covered with eyes&#10;watched carefully as his organs were woven into the chariot. The&#10;village burned. A knight leaned from his saddle to cut a fleeing&#10;woman down, harvesting her like a stalk of wheat.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;No!&#8221; shrieked Asza, and ran toward the village.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Marish tried to run, but he could only hobble, gasping, pain&#10;tearing through his side. Asza snatched a spear from the ground and&#10;swung up onto a horse. Her hair was like Temur&#8217;s, flowing gold. My&#10;Asza, my Temur, he thought. I must protect her.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Marish fell; he hit the ground and held onto it like a lover, as&#10;if he might fall into the sky. Fool, fool, said the voice of his&#10;good sense. That is not your Asza, or your Temur either. She is not&#10;yours at all.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He heaved himself up again and lurched on, as Asza of the rocky&#10;plains reached the chariot. From above, a lazy plume of flame&#10;expanded. The horse reared. The cloud of fire enveloped the woman,&#10;the horse, and then was sucked away; the blackened corpses fell to&#10;the ground steaming.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Marish stopped running.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The headless creature of fire fell from the chariot&#8212;Kadath-Naan&#10;was there at the summit of the horror, his spear sunk in its flesh&#10;as a lever. But the fire-beast turned as it toppled, and a pillar&#10;of fire engulfed the jackal-man. The molten iron of his spear and&#10;armor coated his body, and he fell into the grasping arms of the&#10;chariot.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Marish lay down on his belly in the grass.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Maybe they will not find me here, said the voice of hope. But it&#10;was like listening to idiot words spoken by the wind blowing&#10;through a forest. Marish lay on the ground and he hurt. The hurt&#10;was a song, and it sang him. Everything was lost and far away. No&#10;Asza, no Temur, no Maghd; no quest, no hero, no trickster, no&#10;hunter, no father, no groom. The wind came down from the mountains&#10;and stirred the grass beside Marish&#8217;s nose, where beetles&#10;walked.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There was a rustling in the short grass, and a hedgehog came out&#10;of it and stood nose to nose with Marish.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Speak if you can,&#8221; Marish whispered, &#8220;and grant me a wish.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The hedgehog snorted. &#8220;I&#8217;ll not do&#38;#160;you&#38;#160;any favors,&#10;after what you did to Teodor!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Marish swallowed. &#8220;The hedgehog in the sunflowers?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Obviously. Murderer.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry! I didn&#8217;t know he was magic! I thought he was just a&#10;hedgehog!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Just a hedgehog! Just a hedgehog!&#8221; It narrowed its eyes, and&#10;its prickers stood on end. &#8220;Be careful what you call things, Marish&#10;of Ilmak Dale. When you name a thing, you say what it is in the&#10;world. Names mean more than you know.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Marish was silent.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Teodor didn&#8217;t like threats, that&#8217;s all&#38;#160;&#8230; the stubborn old&#10;idiot.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry about Teodor,&#8221; said Marish.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Yes, well,&#8221; said the hedgehog. &#8220;I&#8217;ll help you, but it will cost&#10;you dear.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;What do you want?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;How about your soul?&#8221; said the hedgehog.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I&#8217;d do that, sure,&#8221; said Marish. &#8220;It&#8217;s not like I need it. But&#10;I don&#8217;t have it.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The hedgehog narrowed its eyes again. From the village, a few&#10;thin screams and the soft crackle of flames. It smelled like&#10;autumn, and butchering hogs.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;It&#8217;s true,&#8221; said Marish. &#8220;The priest of Ilmak Dale took all our&#10;souls and put them in little stones, and hid them. He didn&#8217;t want&#10;us making bargains like these.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Wise man,&#8221; said the hedgehog. &#8220;But I&#8217;ll have to have something.&#10;What have you got in you, besides a soul?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;What do you mean, like, my wits? But I&#8217;ll need those.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Yes, you will,&#8221; said the hedgehog.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Hope? Not much of that left, though.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Not to my taste anyway,&#8221; said the hedgehog.&#10;&#8220;&#8216;Hope&#60;em&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/em&#62;is&#60;em&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/em&#62;foolis&#60;em&#62;h&#60;/em&#62;,&#60;em&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/em&#62;doubts&#60;em&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/em&#62;are&#60;em&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/em&#62;wise.&#8217;&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Doubts?&#8221; said Marish.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;That&#8217;ll do,&#8221; said the hedgehog. &#8220;But I want them all.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;All&#38;#160;&#8230; all right,&#8221; said Marish. &#8220;And now you&#8217;re going to&#10;help me against the White Witch?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I already have,&#8221; said the hedgehog.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;You have? Have I got some magic power or other now?&#8221; asked&#10;Marish. He sat up. The screaming was over: he heard nothing but the&#10;fire, and the crunching and squelching and slithering and grinding&#10;of the chariot.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Certainly not,&#8221; said the hedgehog. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t done anything you&#10;didn&#8217;t see or didn&#8217;t hear. But perhaps you weren&#8217;t listening.&#8221; And&#10;it waddled off into the green blades of the grass.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Marish stood and looked after it. He picked at his teeth with a&#10;thumbnail, and thought, but he had no idea what the hedgehog meant.&#10;But he had no doubts either, so he started toward the village.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Halfway there, he noticed the dead baby in his pack wriggling,&#10;so he took it out and held it in his arms.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As he came into the burning village, he found himself just&#10;behind the great fire-spouting lizard-skinned headless thing. It&#10;turned and took a breath to burn him alive, and he tossed the baby&#10;down its throat. There was a choking sound, and the huge thing&#10;shuddered and twitched, and Marish walked on by it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The great chariot saw him and it swung toward him, a vast&#10;mountain of writhing, humming, stinking flesh, a hundred arms&#10;reaching. Fists grabbed his shirt, his hair, his trousers, and they&#10;lifted him into the air.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He looked at the hand closed around his collar. It was a woman&#8217;s&#10;hand, fine and fair, and it was wearing the copper ring he&#8217;d bought&#10;at Halde.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Temur!&#8221; he said in shock.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The arm twitched and slackened; it went white. It reached out:&#10;the fingers spread wide; they caressed his cheek gently. And then&#10;the arm dropped from the chariot and lay on the ground beneath.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He knew the hands pulling him aloft. &#8220;Lezur the baker!&#8221; he&#10;whispered, and a pair of doughy hands dropped from the chariot.&#10;&#8220;Silbon and Felbon!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Ter the blind! Sela the blue-eyed!&#8221;&#10;Marish&#8217;s lips trembled to say the names, and the hands slackened&#10;and fell to the ground, and away on other parts of the chariot the&#10;other parts fell off, too; he saw a blue eye roll down from above&#10;him and fall to the ground.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Perdan! Mardid! Pilg and his old mother! Fazt&#8212;oh Fazt, you&#8217;ll&#10;tell no more jokes! Chibar and his wife, the pretty foreign one!&#8221;&#10;His face was wet; with every name, a bubble popped open in Marish&#8217;s&#10;chest, and his throat was thick with some strange feeling. &#8220;Pizdar&#10;the priest! Fat Deri, far from your smithy! Thin Deri!&#8221; When all&#10;the hands and arms of Ilmak Dale had fallen off, he was left&#10;standing free. He looked at the strange hands coming toward him.&#10;&#8220;You were a potter,&#8221; he said to hands with clay under the nails,&#10;and they fell off the chariot. &#8220;And you were a butcher,&#8221; he said to&#10;bloody ones, and they fell, too. &#8220;A fat farmer, a beautiful young&#10;girl, a grandmother, a harlot, a brawler,&#8221; he said, and enough&#10;hands and feet and heads and organs had slid off the chariot now&#10;that it sagged in the middle and pieces of it strove with each&#10;other blindly. &#8220;Men and women of Eckdale,&#8221; Marish said, &#8220;men and&#10;women of Halde, of Gravenge, of the fields and the swamps and the&#10;rocky plains.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The chariot fell to pieces; some lay silent and still, others&#10;that Marish had not named had lost their purchase and thrashed on&#10;the ground.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The skin of the great chamber atop the chariot peeled away and&#10;the White Witch leapt into the sky. She was three times as tall as&#10;any woman; her skin was bone white; one eye was blood red and the&#10;other emerald green; her mouth was full of black fangs, and her&#10;hair of snakes and lizards. Her hands were full of lightning, and&#10;she sailed onto Marish with her fangs wide open.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And around her neck, on a leather thong, she wore a little doll&#10;of rags, the size of a child&#8217;s hand.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Maghd of Ilmak Dale,&#8221; Marish said, and she was also a young&#10;woman with muddy hair and an uncertain smile, and that&#8217;s how she&#10;landed before Marish.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Well done, Marish,&#8221; said Maghd, and pulled at a muddy lock of&#10;her hair, and laughed, and looked at the ground. &#8220;Well done! Oh,&#10;I&#8217;m glad. I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;ve come.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Why did you do it, Maghd?&#8221; Marish said. &#8220;Oh, why?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She looked up and her lips twitched and her jaw set. &#8220;Can you&#10;ask me that? You, Marish?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She reached across, slowly, and took his hand. She pulled him,&#10;and he took a step toward her. She put the back of his hand against&#10;her cheek.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;You&#8217;d gone out hunting,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And that Temur of&#10;yours&#8221;&#8212;she said the name as if it tasted of vinegar&#8212;&#8220;she seen me&#10;back of Lezur&#8217;s, and for one time I didn&#8217;t look down. I looked at&#10;her eyes, and she named me a foul witch. And then they were all&#10;crowding round&#8212;&#8221; She shrugged. &#8220;And I don&#8217;t like that. Fussing and&#10;crowding and one against the other.&#8221; She let go his hand and&#10;stooped to pick up a clot of earth, and she crumbled it in her&#10;hands. &#8220;So I knit them all together. All one thing. They did like&#10;it. And they were so fine and great and happy, I forgave them. Even&#10;Temur.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The limbs lay unmoving on the ground; the guts were piled in&#10;soft unbreathing hills, like drifts of snow. Maghd&#8217;s hands were&#10;coated with black crumbs of dirt.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I reckon they&#8217;re done of playing now,&#8221; Maghd said, and&#10;sighed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;How?&#8221; Marish said. &#8220;How&#8217;d you do it? Maghd,&#10;what&#38;#160;are&#38;#160;you?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Don&#8217;t fool so! I&#8217;m Maghd, same as ever. I found the souls,&#10;that&#8217;s all. Dug them up from Pizdar&#8217;s garden, sold them to the&#10;Spirit of Unwinding Things.&#8221; She brushed the dirt from her&#10;hands.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;And&#38;#160;&#8230; the children then? Maghd, the babes?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She took his hand again, but she didn&#8217;t look at him. She laid&#10;her cheek against her shoulder and watched the ground. &#8220;Babes&#10;shouldn&#8217;t grow,&#8221; she said. &#8220;No call to be big and hateful.&#8221; She&#10;swallowed. &#8220;I made them perfect. That&#8217;s all.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Marish&#8217;s chest tightened. &#8220;And what now?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She looked at him, and a slow grin crept across her face. &#8220;Well&#10;now,&#8221; she said. &#8220;That&#8217;s on you, ain&#8217;t it, Marish? I got plenty of&#10;tricks yet, if you want to keep fighting.&#8221; She stepped close to&#10;him, and rested her cheek on his chest. Her hair smelled like home:&#10;rushes and fire smoke, cold mornings and sheep&#8217;s milk. &#8220;Or we can&#10;gather close. No one to shame us now.&#8221; She wrapped her arms around&#10;his waist. &#8220;It&#8217;s all new, Marish, but it ain&#8217;t all bad.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A shadow drifted over them, and Marish looked up to see the&#10;djinn on his carpet, peering down. Marish cleared his throat.&#10;&#8220;Well&#38;#160;&#8230; I suppose we&#8217;re all we have left, aren&#8217;t we?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; Maghd breathed softly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He took her hands in his, and drew back to look at her. &#8220;Will&#10;you be mine, Maghd?&#8221; he said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Oh yes,&#8221; said Maghd, and smiled the biggest smile of her&#10;life.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Very good,&#8221; Marish said, and looked up. &#8220;You can take her&#10;now.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The djinn opened the little bottle that was in his hand and&#10;Maghd the White Witch flew into it, and he put the cap on. He bowed&#10;to Marish, and then he flew away.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Behind Marish the fire-beast exploded with a dull boom.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Marish walked out of the village a little ways and sat, and&#10;after sitting a while he slept. And then he woke and sat, and then&#10;he slept some more. Perhaps he ate as well; he wasn&#8217;t sure what.&#10;Mostly he looked at his hands; they were rough and callused, with&#10;dirt under the nails. He watched the wind painting waves in the&#10;short grass, around the rocks and bodies lying there.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;One morning he woke, and the ruined village was full of&#10;jackal-headed men in armor made of discs who were mounted on great&#10;red cats with pointed ears, and jackal-headed men in black robes&#10;who were measuring for monuments, and jackal-headed men dressed&#10;only in loincloths who were digging in the ground.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Marish went to the ones in loincloths and said, &#8220;I want to help&#10;bury them,&#8221; and they gave him a shovel.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 2872, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/2872', :deleted => 0)
