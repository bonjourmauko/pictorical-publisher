Text.create(:title => coder.decode('The Birth of a Man'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;The year was the year &#39;92&#8212;the year of leanness&#8212;the scene a spot&#10;between Sukhum and Otchenchiri, on the river Kodor, a spot so near&#10;to the sea that amid the joyous babble of a sparkling rivulet the&#10;ocean&#39;s deep-voiced thunder was plainly distinguishable.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Also, the season being autumn, leaves of wild laurel were&#10;glistening and gyrating on the white foam of the Kodor like a&#10;quantity of mercurial salmon fry. And as I sat on some rocks&#10;overlooking the river there occurred to me the thought that, as&#10;likely as not, the cause of the gulls&#39; and cormorants&#39; fretful&#10;cries where the surf lay moaning behind a belt of trees to the&#10;right was that, like myself, they kept mistaking the leaves for&#10;fish, and as often finding themselves disappointed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Over my head hung chestnut trees decked with gold; at my feet&#10;lay a mass of chestnut leaves which resembled the amputated palms&#10;of human hands; on the opposite bank, where there waved,&#10;tanglewise, the stripped branches of a hornbeam, an orange-tinted&#10;woodpecker was darting to and fro, as though caught in the mesh of&#10;foliage, and, in company with a troupe of nimble titmice and blue&#10;tree-creepers (visitors from the far-distant North), tapping the&#10;bark of the stem with a black beak, and hunting for insects.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;To the left, the tops of the mountains hung fringed with dense,&#10;fleecy clouds of the kind which presages rain; and these clouds&#10;were sending their shadows gliding over slopes green and overgrown&#10;with boxwood and that peculiar species of hollow beech-stump which&#10;once came near to effecting the downfall of Pompey&#39;s host, through&#10;depriving his iron-built legions of the use of their legs as they&#10;revelled in the intoxicating sweetness of the &#34;mead&#34; or honey which&#10;wild bees make from the blossoms of the laurel and the azalea, and&#10;travellers still gather from those hollow stems to knead into&#10;lavashi or thin cakes of millet flour.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;On the present occasion I too (after suffering sundry stings&#10;from infuriated bees) was thus engaged as I sat on the rocks&#10;beneath the chestnuts. Dipping morsels of bread into a potful of&#10;honey, I was munching them for breakfast, and enjoying, at the same&#10;time, the indolent beams of the moribund autumn sun.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In the fall of the year the Caucasus resembles a gorgeous&#10;cathedral built by great craftsmen (always great craftsmen are&#10;great sinners) to conceal their past from the prying eyes of&#10;conscience. Which cathedral is a sort of intangible edifice of gold&#10;and turquoise and emerald, and has thrown over its hills rare&#10;carpets silk-embroidered by Turcoman weavers of Shemi and&#10;Samarkand, and contains, heaped everywhere, plunder brought from&#10;all the quarters of the world for the delectation of the sun. Yes,&#10;it is as though men sought to say to the Sun God: &#34;All things here&#10;are thine. They have been brought hither for thee by thy&#10;people.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Yes, mentally I see long-bearded, grey-headed supermen, beings&#10;possessed of the rounded eyes of happy children, descending from&#10;the hills, and decking the earth, and sowing it with sheerly&#10;kaleidoscopic treasures, and coating the tops of the mountains with&#10;massive layers of silver, and the lower edges with a living web of&#10;trees. Yes, I see those beings decorating and fashioning the scene&#10;until, thanks to their labours, this gracious morsel of the earth&#10;has become fair beyond all conception.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And what a privilege it is to be human! How much that is&#10;wonderful leaps to the eye-how the presence of beauty causes. the&#10;heart to throb with a voluptuous rapture that is almost pain!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And though there are occasions when life seems hard, and the&#10;breast feels filled with fiery rancour, and melancholy dries and&#10;renders athirst the heart&#39;s blood, this is not a mood sent us in&#10;perpetuity. For at times even the sun may feel sad as he&#10;contemplates men, and sees that, despite all that he has done for&#10;them, they have done so little in return&#8230; .&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;No, it is not that good folk are lacking. It is that they need&#10;to be rounded off&#8212;better still, to be made anew.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Suddenly there came into view over the bushes to my left a file&#10;of dark heads, while through the surging of the waves and the&#10;babble of the stream I caught the sound of human voices, a sound&#10;emanating from a party of &#34;famine people&#34; or folk who were&#10;journeying from Sukhum to Otchenchiri to obtain work on a local&#10;road then in process of construction.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The owners of the voices I knew to be immigrants from the&#10;province of Orlov. I knew them to be so for the reason that I&#10;myself had lately been working in company with the male members of&#10;the party, and had taken leave of them only yesterday in order that&#10;I might set out earlier than they, and, after walking through the&#10;night, greet the sun when he should arise above the sea.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The members of the party comprised four men and a woman&#8212;the&#10;latter a young female with high cheek-bones, a figure swollen with&#10;manifest pregnancy, and a pair of greyish-blue eyes that had fixed&#10;in them a stare of apprehension. At the present moment her head and&#10;yellow scarf were just showing over the tops of the bushes; and&#10;while I noted that now it was swaying from side to side like a&#10;sunflower shaken by the wind, I recalled the fact that she was a&#10;woman whose husband had been carried off at Sukhum by a surfeit of&#10;fruit&#8212;this fact being known to me through the circumstance that in&#10;the workmen&#39;s barraque where we had shared quarters these folk had&#10;observed the good old Russian custom of confiding to a stranger the&#10;whole of their troubles, and had done so in tones of such amplitude&#10;and penetration that the querulous words must have been audible for&#10;five versts around.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And as I had talked to these forlorn people, these human beings&#10;who lay crushed beneath the misfortune which had uprooted them from&#10;their barren and exhausted lands, and blown them, like autumn&#10;leaves, towards the Caucasus where nature&#39;s luxuriant, but&#10;unfamiliar, aspect had blinded and bewildered them, and with its&#10;onerous conditions of labour quenched their last spark of courage;&#10;as I had talked to these poor people I had seen them glancing about&#10;with dull, troubled, despondent eyes, and heard them say to one&#10;another softly, and with pitiful smiles:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What a country!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Aye,&#8212;that it is!&#8212;a country to make one sweat!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;As hard as a stone it is!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Aye, an evil country!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;After which they had gone on to speak of their native haunts,&#10;where every handful of soil had represented to them the dust of&#10;their ancestors, and every grain of that soil had been watered with&#10;the sweat of their brows, and become charged with dear and intimate&#10;recollections.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Previously there had joined the party a woman who, tall and&#10;straight, had had breasts as flat as a board, and jawbones like the&#10;jawbones of a horse, and a glance in her dull, sidelong black eyes&#10;like a gleaming, smouldering fire.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And every evening this woman had been wont to step outside the&#10;barraque with the woman in the yellow scarf and to seat herself on&#10;a rubbish heap, and, resting her cheeks on the palms of her hands,&#10;and inclining her head sideways, to sing in a high and shrewish&#10;voice:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p class=&#34;poem&#34;&#62;Behind the graveyard wall,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Where fair green bushes stand.&#60;br /&#62;&#10;I&#39;ll spread me on the sand&#60;br /&#62;&#10;A shroud as white as snow.&#60;br /&#62;&#10;And not long will it be&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Before my heart&#39;s adored,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;My master and my lord,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Shall answer my curtsey low.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Usually her companion, the woman in the yellow scarf, had, with&#10;head bent forward and eyes fixed upon her stomach, remained silent;&#10;but on rare, unexpected occasions she had, in the hoarse, sluggish&#10;voice of a peasant, sung a song with the sobbing refrain:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p class=&#34;poem&#34;&#62;Ah, my beloved, sweetheart of mine,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Never again will these eyes seek thine!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Nor amid the stifling blackness of the southern night had these&#10;voices ever failed to bring back to my memory the snowy wastes of&#10;the North, and the icy, wailing storm-wind, and the distant howling&#10;of unseen wolves.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In time, the squint-eyed woman had been taken ill of a fever,&#10;and removed to the town in a tilted ambulance; and as she had lain&#10;quivering and moaning on the stretcher she had seemed still to be&#10;singing her little ditty about the graveyard and the sand.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The head with the yellow scarf rose, dipped, and&#10;disappeared.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;After I had finished my breakfast I thatched the honey-pot with&#10;some leaves, fastened down the lid, and indolently resumed my way&#10;in the wake of the party, my blackthorn staff tiptapping against&#10;the hard tread of the track as I proceeded.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The track loomed&#8212;a grey, narrow strip&#8212;before me, while on my&#10;right the restless, dark blue sea had the air of being ceaselessly&#10;planed by thousands of invisible carpenters; so regularly did the&#10;stress of a wind as moist and sweet and warm as the breath of a&#10;healthy woman cause ever-rustling curls of foam to drift towards&#10;the beach. Also, careening on to its port quarter under a full set&#10;of bellying sails, a Turkish felucca was gliding towards Sukhum;&#10;and, as it held on its course, it put me in mind of a certain&#10;pompous engineer of the town who had been wont to inflate his fat&#10;cheeks and say: &#34;Be quiet, you, or I will have you locked up!&#34; This&#10;man had, for some reason or another, an extraordinary weakness for&#10;causing arrests to be made; and, exceedingly do I rejoice to think&#10;that by now the worms of the graveyard must have consumed him down&#10;to the very marrow of his bones. Would that certain other&#10;acquaintances of mine were similarly receiving beneficent&#10;attention!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Walking proved an easy enough task, for I seemed to be borne on&#10;air, while a chorus of pleasant thoughts, of many-coloured&#10;recollections, kept singing gently in my breast&#8212;a chorus&#10;resembling, indeed, the white-maned billows in the regularity with&#10;which now it rose, and now it fell, to reveal in, as it were, soft,&#10;peaceful depths the bright, supple hopes of youth, like so many&#10;silver fish cradled in the bosom of the ocean.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Suddenly, as it trended seawards, the road executed a half-turn,&#10;and skirted a strip of the sandy margin to which the waves kept&#10;rolling in such haste. And in that spot even the bushes seemed to&#10;have a mind to look the waves in the eyes&#8212;so strenuously did they&#10;lean across the riband-like path, and nod in the direction of the&#10;blue, watery waste, while from the hills a wind was blowing that&#10;presaged rain.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But hark! From some point among the bushes a low moan arose&#8212;the&#10;sound which never fails to thrill the soul and move it to&#10;responsive quivers!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Thrusting aside the foliage, I beheld before me the woman in the&#10;yellow scarf. Seated with her back resting against the stem of a&#10;hazel-bush, she had her head sunken deeply between her shoulders,&#10;her mouth hideously agape, her eyes staring vaguely before her, her&#10;hands pressed to her swollen stomach, her breath issuing with&#10;unnatural vehemence, and her abdomen convulsively, spasmodically&#10;rising and falling. Meanwhile from her throat were issuing moans&#10;which at times caused her yellow teeth to show bare like those of a&#10;wolf.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What is the matter?&#34; I said as I bent over her. &#34;Has anyone&#10;assaulted you?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The only result was that, shuffling bare feet in the sand like a&#10;fly, she shook her nerveless hand, and gasped:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Away, villain! Away with you!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then I understood what was the matter, for I had seen a similar&#10;case before. Yet for the moment a certain feeling of shyness made&#10;me edge away from her a little; and as I did so, she uttered a&#10;prolonged moan, and her almost bursting eyeballs vented hot, murky&#10;tears which trickled down her tense and livid features.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Thereupon I turned to her again, and, throwing down cooking-pot,&#10;teapot, and wallet, laid her on her back, and strove to bend her&#10;knees upwards in the direction of her body. Meanwhile she sought to&#10;repel me with blows on face and breast, and at length rolled on to&#10;her stomach. Then, raising herself on all fours, she, sobbing,&#10;gasping, and cursing in a breath, crawled away like a bear into a&#10;remoter portion of the thicket.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Beast!&#34; she panted. &#34;Oh, you devil!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Yet, even as the words escaped her lips, her arms gave way&#10;beneath her, and she collapsed upon her face, with legs stretched&#10;out, and her lips emitting a fresh series of convulsive moans.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Excited now to fever pitch, I hurriedly recalled my small store&#10;of knowledge of such cases and finally decided to turn her on her&#10;back, and, as before, to strive to bend her knees upwards in the&#10;direction of her body. Already signs of imminent parturition were&#10;not wanting.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Lie still,&#34; I said, &#34;and if you do that it will not be long&#10;before you are delivered of the child.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Whereafter, running down to the sea, I pulled up my sleeves,&#10;and, on returning, embarked upon my role, of accoucheur.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Scoring the earth with her fingers, uprooting tufts of withered&#10;grass, and struggling to thrust them into her mouth, scattering&#10;soil over her terrible, inhuman face and bloodshot eyes, the woman&#10;writhed like a strip of birch bark in a wood fire. Indeed, by this&#10;time a little head was coming into view, and it needed all my&#10;efforts to quell the twitchings of her legs, to help the child to&#10;issue, and to prevent its mother from thrusting grass down her&#10;distorted, moaning throat. Meanwhile we cursed one another&#8212;she&#10;through her teeth, and I in an undertone; she, I should surmise,&#10;out of pain and shame, and I, I feel certain, out of nervousness,&#10;mingled with a perfect agony of compassion.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O Lord!&#34; she gasped with blue lips flecked with foam as her&#10;eyes (suddenly bereft of their colour in the sunlight) shed tears&#10;born of the intolerable anguish of the maternal function, and her&#10;body writhed and twisted as though her frame had been severed in&#10;the middle.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Away, you brute!&#34; was her oft-repeated cry as with her weak&#10;hands, hands seemingly dislocated at the wrists, she strove to&#10;thrust me to a distance. Yet all the time I kept saying&#10;persuasively: &#34;You fool! Bring forth as quickly as you can!&#34; and,&#10;as a matter of fact, was feeling so sorry for her that tears&#10;continued to spurt from my eyes as much as from hers, and my very&#10;heart contracted with pity. Also, never did I cease to feel that I&#10;ought to keep saying something; wherefore, I repeated, and again&#10;repeated: &#34;Now then! Bring forth as quickly as ever you can!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And at last my hands did indeed hold a human creature in all its&#10;pristine beauty. Nor could even the mist of tears prevent me from&#10;seeing that that human creature was red in the face, and that to&#10;judge from the manner in which it kept kicking and resisting and&#10;uttering hoarse wails (while still bound to its mother by the&#10;ligament), it was feeling dissatisfied in advance with the world.&#10;Yes, blue-eyed, and with a nose absurdly sunken between a pair of&#10;scarlet, rumpled cheeks and lips which ceaselessly quivered and&#10;contracted, it kept bawling: &#34;A-aah! A-a-ah!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Moreover, so slippery was it that, as I knelt and looked at it&#10;and laughed with relief at the fact that it had arrived safely, I&#10;came near to letting it fall upon the ground: wherefore I entirely&#10;forgot what next I ought to have done.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Cut it!&#34; at length whispered the mother with eyes closed, and&#10;features suddenly swollen and resembling those of a corpse.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;A knife!&#34; again she whispered with her livid lips. &#34;Cut&#10;it!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;My pocket-knife I had had stolen from me in the workmen&#39;s&#10;barraque; but with my teeth I severed the caul, and then the child&#10;gave renewed tongue in true Orlovian fashion, while the mother&#10;smiled. Also, in some curious fashion, the mother&#39;s unfathomable&#10;eyes regained their colour, and became filled as with blue fire as,&#10;plunging a hand into her bodice and feeling for the pocket, she&#10;contrived to articulate with raw and blood-flecked lips:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I have not a single piece of string or riband to bind the caul&#10;with.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Upon that I set to, and managed to produce a piece of riband,&#10;and to fasten it in the required position.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Thereafter she smiled more brightly than ever. So radiantly did&#10;she smile that my eyes came near to being blinded with the&#10;spectacle.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And now rearrange yourself,&#34; I said, &#34;and in the meanwhile I&#10;will go and wash the baby.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, yes,&#34; she murmured uneasily. &#34;But be very careful with&#10;him&#8212;be very gentle.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Yet it was little enough care that the rosy little homunculus&#10;seemed to require, so strenuously did he clench his fists, and bawl&#10;as though he were minded to challenge the whole world to&#10;combat.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Come, now!&#34; at length I said. &#34;You must have done, or your very&#10;head will drop off.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Yet no sooner did he feel the touch of the ocean spray, and&#10;begin to be sprinkled With its joyous caresses, than he lamented&#10;more loudly and vigorously than ever, and so continued throughout&#10;the process of being slapped on the back and breast as, frowning&#10;and struggling, he vented squall after squall while the waves laved&#10;his tiny limbs.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Shout, young Orlovian!&#34; said I encouragingly. &#34;Let fly with all&#10;the power of your lungs!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And with that, I took him back to his mother. I found her with&#10;eyes closed and lips drawn between her teeth as she writhed in the&#10;torment of expelling the after-birth. But presently I detected&#10;through the sighs and groans a whispered:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Give him to me! Give him to me!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You had better wait a little,&#34; I urged.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh no! Give him to me now!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And with tremulous, unsteady hands she unhooked the bosom of her&#10;bodice, and, freeing (with my assistance) the breast which nature&#10;had prepared for at least a dozen children, applied the mutinous&#10;young Orlovian to the nipple. As for him, he at once understood the&#10;matter, and ceased to send forth further lamentation.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O pure and holy Mother of God!&#34; she gasped in a long-drawn,&#10;quivering sigh as she bent a dishevelled head over the little one,&#10;and, between intervals of silence, fell to uttering soft, abrupt&#10;exclamations. Then, opening her ineffably beautiful blue eyes, the&#10;hallowed eyes of a mother, she raised them towards the azure&#10;heavens, while in their depths there was coming and going a flame&#10;of joy and gratitude. Lastly, lifting a languid hand, she with a&#10;slow movement made the sign of the cross over both herself and her&#10;babe.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Thanks to thee O purest Mother of God!&#34; she murmured. &#34;Thanks&#10;indeed to thee!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then her eyes grew dim and vague again, and after a pause&#10;(during which she seemed to be scarcely breathing) she said in a&#10;hard and matter-of-fact tone:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Young fellow, unfasten my satchel.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And whilst I was so engaged she continued to regard me with a&#10;steady gaze; but, when the task was completed she smiled&#10;shamefacedly, and on her sunken cheeks and sweat-flecked temples&#10;there dawned the ghost of a blush.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Now,&#34; said she, &#34;do you, for the present, go away.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And if I do so, see that in the meanwhile you do not move about&#10;too much.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No, I will not. But please go away.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So I withdrew a little. In my breast a sort of weariness was&#10;lurking, but also in my breast there was echoing a soft and&#10;glorious chorus of birds, a chorus so exquisitely in accord with&#10;the never-ceasing splash of the sea that for ever could I have&#10;listened to it, and to the neighbouring brook as it purled on its&#10;way like a maiden engaged in relating confidences about her&#10;lover.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Presently, the woman&#39;s yellow-scarfed head (the scarf now tidily&#10;rearranged) reappeared over the bushes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Come, come, good woman!&#34; was my exclamation. &#34;I tell you that&#10;you must not move about so soon.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And certainly her attitude now was one of utter languor, and she&#10;had perforce to grasp the stem of a bush with one hand to support&#10;herself. Yet while the blood was gone from her face, there had&#10;formed in the hollows where her eyes had been two lakes of&#10;blue.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;See how he is sleeping!&#34; she murmured.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And, true enough, the child was sound asleep, though to my eyes&#10;he looked much as any other baby might have done, save that the&#10;couch of autumn leaves on which he was ensconced consisted of&#10;leaves of a kind which could not have been discovered in the&#10;faraway forests of Orlov.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Now, do you yourself lie down awhile,&#34; was my advice.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh, no,&#34; she replied with a shake of her head on its sinuous&#10;neck; &#34;for I must be collecting my things before I move on&#10;towards&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Towards Otchenchiri&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes. By now my folk will have gone many a verst in that&#10;direction.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And can you walk so far?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The Holy Mother will help me.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Yes, she was to journey in the company of the Mother of God. So&#10;no more on the point required to be said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Glancing again at the tiny, inchoate face under the bushes, her&#10;eyes diffused rays of warm and kindly light as, licking her lips,&#10;she, with a slow movement, smoothed the breast of the little&#10;one.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then I arranged sticks for a fire, and also adjusted stones to&#10;support the kettle.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Soon I will have tea ready for you,&#34; I remarked.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And thankful indeed I shall be,&#34; she responded, &#34;for my breasts&#10;are dried up.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why have your companions deserted you?&#34; I said next.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;They have not deserted me. It was I that left them of my own&#10;accord. How could I have exposed myself in their presence?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And with a glance at me she raised a hand to her face as,&#10;spitting a gout of blood, she smiled a sort of bashful smile.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;This is your first child, I take it?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It is&#8230; . And who are you?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;A man.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, a man, of course; but, are you a MARRIED man?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No, I have never been able to marry.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That cannot be true.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why not?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With lowered eyes she sat awhile in thought.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Because, if so, how do you come to know so much about women&#39;s&#10;affairs?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;This time I DID lie, for I replied:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Because they have been my study. In fact, I am a medical&#10;student.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ah! Our priest&#39;s son also was a student, but a student for the&#10;Church.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Very well. Then you know what I am. Now I will go and fetch&#10;some water.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Upon this she inclined her head towards her little son and&#10;listened for a moment to his breathing. Then she said with a glance&#10;towards the sea:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I too should like to have a wash, but I do not know what the&#10;water is like. What is it? Brackish or salt?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No; quite good water&#8212;fit for you to wash in.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Is it really?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, really. Moreover, it is warmer than the water of the&#10;streams hereabouts, which is as cold as ice.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ah! Well, you know best.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Here a shaggy-eared pony, all skin and bone, was seen&#10;approaching us at a foot&#39;s pace. Trembling, and drooping its head,&#10;it scanned us, as it drew level, with a round black eye, and&#10;snorted. Upon that, its rider pushed back a ragged fur cap, glanced&#10;warily in our direction, and again sank his head.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The folk of these parts are ugly to look at,&#34; softly commented&#10;the woman from Orlov.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then I departed in quest of water. After I had washed my face&#10;and hands I filled the kettle from a stream bright and lively as&#10;quicksilver (a stream presenting, as the autumn leaves tossed in&#10;the eddies which went leaping and singing over the stones, a truly&#10;enchanting spectacle), and, returning, and peeping through the&#10;bushes, perceived the woman to be crawling on hands and knees over&#10;the stones, and anxiously peering about, as though in search of&#10;something.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What is it?&#34; I inquired, and thereupon, turning grey in the&#10;face with confusion she hastened to conceal some article under her&#10;person, although I had already guessed the nature of the&#10;article.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Give it to me,&#34; was my only remark. &#34;I will go and bury&#10;it.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;How so? For, as a matter of fact, it ought to be buried under&#10;the floor in front of some stove.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Are we to build a stove HERE? Build it in five minutes?&#34; I&#10;retorted.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ah, I was jesting. But really, I would rather not have it&#10;buried here, lest some wild beast should come and devour it&#8230; Yet it&#10;ought to be committed only to the earth.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;That said, she, with averted eyes, handed me a moist and heavy&#10;bundle; and as she did so she said under her breath, with an air of&#10;confusion:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I beg of you for Christ&#39;s sake to bury it as well, as deeply,&#10;as you can. Out of pity for my son do as I bid you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I did as she had requested; and, just as the task had been&#10;completed, I perceived her returning from the margin of the sea&#10;with unsteady gait, and an arm stretched out before her, and a&#10;petticoat soaked to the middle with the sea water. Yet all her face&#10;was alight with inward fire, and as I helped her to regain the spot&#10;where I had prepared some sticks I could not help reflecting with&#10;some astonishment:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;How strong indeed she is!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Next, as we drank a mixture of tea and honey, she inquired:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Have you now ceased to be a student?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And why so? Through too much drink?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Even so, good mother.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Dear me! Well, your face is familiar to me. Yes, I remember&#10;that I noticed you in Sukhum when once you were arguing with the&#10;barraque superintendent over the question of rations. As I did so&#10;the thought occurred to me: &#39;Surely that bold young fellow must&#10;have gone and spent his means on drink? Yes, that is how it must&#10;be.&#39;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then, as from her swollen lips she licked a drop of honey, she&#10;again bent her blue eyes in the direction of the bush under which&#10;the slumbering, newly-arrived Orlovian was couched.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;How will he live?&#34; thoughtfully she said with a sigh&#8212;then&#10;added:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You have helped me, and I thank you. Yes, my thanks are yours,&#10;though I cannot tell whether or not your assistance will have&#10;helped HIM.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And, drinking the rest of her tea, she ate a morsel of bread,&#10;then made the sign of the cross. And subsequently, as I was putting&#10;up my things, she continued to rock herself to and fro, to give&#10;little starts and cries, and to gaze thoughtfully at the ground&#10;with eyes which had now regained their original colour. At last she&#10;rose to her feet.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You are not going yet?&#34; I queried protestingly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, I must.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The Blessed Virgin will go with me. So please hand me over the&#10;child.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No, I will carry him.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And, after a contest for the honour, she yielded, and we walked&#10;away side by side.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I only wish I were a little steadier on my feet,&#34; she remarked&#10;with an apologetic smile as she laid a hand upon my shoulder.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Meanwhile, the new citizen of Russia, the little human being of&#10;an unknown future, was snoring soundly in my arms as the sea&#10;plashed and murmured, and threw off its white shavings, and the&#10;bushes whispered together, and the sun (now arrived at the&#10;meridian) shone brightly upon us all.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In calm content it was that we walked; save that now and then&#10;the mother would halt, draw a deep breath, raise her head, scan the&#10;sea and the forest and the hills, and peer into her son&#39;s face. And&#10;as she did so, even the mist begotten of tears of suffering could&#10;not dim the wonderful brilliancy and clearness of her eyes. For&#10;with the sombre fire of inexhaustible love were those eyes&#10;aflame.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Once, as she halted, she exclaimed:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O God, O Mother of God, how good it all is! Would that for ever&#10;I could walk thus, yes, walk and walk unto the very end of the&#10;world! All that I should need would be that thou, my son, my&#10;darling son, shouldst, borne upon thy mother&#39;s breast, grow and wax&#10;strong!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And the sea murmured and murmured.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 19, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/3920')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('The Icebreaker'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;On a frozen river near a certain Russian town, a gang of seven&#10;carpenters were hastily repairing an icebreaker which the townsfolk&#10;had stripped for firewood.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;That year spring happened to be late in arriving, and youthful&#10;March looked more like October, and only at noon, and that not on&#10;every day, did the pale, wintry sun show himself in the overcast&#10;heavens, or, glimmering in blue spaces between clouds, contemplate&#10;the earth with a squinting, malevolent eye.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The day in question was the Friday in Holy Week, and, as night&#10;drew on, drippings were becoming congealed into icicles half an&#10;arshin long, and in the snow-stripped ice of the river only the dun&#10;hue of the wintry clouds was reflected.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As the carpenters worked there kept mournfully, insistently&#10;echoing from the town the coppery note of bells; and at intervals&#10;heads would raise themselves, and blue eyes would gleam&#10;thoughtfully through the same grey fog in which the town lay&#10;enveloped, and an axe uplifted would hover a moment in the air as&#10;though fearing with its descent to cleave the luscious flood of&#10;sound.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Scattered over the spacious river-track were dark pine branches,&#10;projecting obliquely from the ice, to mark paths, open spaces, and&#10;cracks on the surface; and where they reared themselves aloft,&#10;these branches looked like the cramped, distorted arms of drowning&#10;men.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;From the river came a whiff of gloom and depression. Covered&#10;over with sodden slush, it stretched with irksome rigidity towards&#10;the misty quarter whence blew a languid, sluggish, damp, cold&#10;wind.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Suddenly the foreman, one Ossip, a cleanly built, upright little&#10;peasant with a neatly curling, silvery beard, ruddy cheeks, and a&#10;flexible neck, a man everywhere and always in evidence,&#10;shouted:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Look alive there, my hearties!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Presently he turned his attention to myself, and smiled&#10;insinuatingly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Inspector,&#34; he said, &#34;what are you trying to poke out of the&#10;sky with that squat nose of yours? And why are you here at all? You&#10;come from the contractor, you say?&#8212;from Vasili Sergeitch? Well,&#10;well! Then your job is to hurry us up, to keep barking out, &#39;Mind&#10;what you are doing, such-and-such gang!&#39; Yet there you&#10;stand-blinking over your task like an object dried stiff! It&#39;s not&#10;to blink that you&#39;re here, but to play the watchdog upon us, and to&#10;keep an eye open, and your tongue on the wag. So issue your&#10;commands, young cockerel.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then he shouted to the workmen:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Now, then! No shirking! Is the job going to be finished&#10;tonight, or is it not?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As a matter of fact, he himself was the worst shirker in the&#10;artel [Workman&#39;s union]. True, he was also a first-rate hand at his&#10;trade, and a man who could work quickly and well and with skill and&#10;concentration; but, unfortunately, he hated putting himself out,&#10;and preferred to spend his time spinning arresting yarns. For&#10;instance, on the present occasion he chose the moment when work was&#10;proceeding with a swing, when everyone was busily and silently and&#10;wholeheartedly labouring with the object of running the job through&#10;to the end, to begin in his musical voice:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Look here, lads. Once upon a time&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And though for the first two or three minutes the men appeared&#10;not to hear him, and continued their planing and chopping as&#10;before, the moment came when the soft tenor accents caught and held&#10;the men&#39;s attention, as they trickled and burbled forth. Then,&#10;screwing up his bright eyes with a humorous air, and twisting his&#10;curly beard between his fingers, Ossip gave a complacent click of&#10;his tongue, and continued measuredly, and with deliberation:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;So he seized hold of the tench, and thrust it back into the&#10;cave. And as he turned to proceed through the forest he thought to&#10;himself: &#39;Now I must keep my eyes about me.&#39; And suddenly, from&#10;somewhere (no one could have said where), a woman&#39;s voice shrieked:&#10;&#39;Elesi-a-ah! Elesia-ah!&#39;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Here a tall, lanky Morduine named Leuka, with, as surname,&#10;Narodetz, a young fellow whose small eyes wore always an expression&#10;of astonishment, laid aside his axe, and stood gaping.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And from the cave a deep bass voice replied: &#39;Elesi-a-ah!&#39;&#10;while at the same moment the tench sprang from the cave, and,&#10;champing its jaws, wriggled and wriggled back to the slough.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Here an old soldier named Saniavin, a morose man, a tippler, and&#10;a sufferer from asthma and an inexplicable grudge against life in&#10;general, croaked out:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;How could your tench have wriggled across dry land if it was a&#10;fish?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Can, for that matter, a fish speak?&#34; was Ossip&#39;s good-humoured&#10;retort.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;All of which inspired Mokei Budirin, a grey-headed muzhik of a&#10;cast of countenance canine in the prominence of his jaws and the&#10;recession of his forehead, and taciturn withal, though not&#10;otherwise remarkable, to give slow, nasal utterance to his&#10;favourite formula.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That is true enough,&#34; he said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For never could anything be spoken of that was grim or&#10;marvellous or lewd or malicious, but Budirin at once re-echoed&#10;softly, but in a tone of unshakable conviction: &#34;That is true&#10;enough.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Thereafter he would tap me on the breast with his hard and&#10;ponderous fist.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Presently work again underwent an interruption through the fact&#10;that Yakov Boev, a man who possessed both a stammer and a squint,&#10;became similarly filled with a desire to tell us something about a&#10;fish. Yet from the moment that he began his narrative everyone&#10;declined to believe it, and laughed at his broken verbiage as,&#10;frequently invoking the Deity, and cursing, and brandishing his&#10;awl, and viciously swallowing spittle, he shouted amid general&#10;ridicule:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Once-once upon a time there lived a man. Yes, other folk before&#10;YOU have believed my tale. Indeed, it is no more than the truth&#10;that I&#39;m going to tell you. Very well! Cackle away, and be&#10;damned!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Here everyone without exception dropped his work to shout with&#10;merriment and clap his hands: with the result that, doffing his&#10;cap, and thereby disclosing a silvered, symmetrically shaped head&#10;with one bald spot amid its one dark portion, Ossip was forced to&#10;shout severely:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Hi, you Budirin! You&#39;ve had your say, and given us some fun,&#10;and there must be no more of it.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But I had only just begun what I want to say,&#34; the old soldier&#10;grumbled, spitting upon the palms of his hands.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Next, Ossip turned to myself.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Inspector,&#34; he began&#8230;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It is my opinion that in thus hindering the men from work&#10;through his tale-telling, Ossip had some definite end in view. I&#10;could not say precisely what that end was, but it must have been&#10;the object either of cloaking his own laziness or of giving the men&#10;a rest. On the other hand, whenever the contractor was present he,&#10;Ossip, bore himself with humble obsequiousness, and continued to&#10;assume a guise of simplicity which none the less did not prevent&#10;him, on the advent of each Saturday, from inducing his employer to&#10;bestow a pourboire upon the artel.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And though this same Ossip was an artelui, and a director of the&#10;artel, his senior co-members bore him no affection, but, rather,&#10;looked upon him as a wag or trifler, and treated him as of no&#10;importance. And, similarly, the younger members of the artel liked&#10;well enough to listen to his tales, but declined to take him&#10;seriously, and, in some cases, regarded him with ill-concealed, or&#10;openly expressed, distrust.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Once the Morduine, a man of education with whom, on occasions, I&#10;held discussions on intimate subjects, replied to a question of&#10;mine on the subject of Ossip:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I scarcely know. Goodness alone knows! No, I do not know&#10;anything about him.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;To which, after a pause, he added:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Once a fellow named Mikhailo, a clever fellow who is now dead,&#10;insulted Ossip by saying to him: &#39;Do you call yourself a man? Why,&#10;regarded as a workman, you&#39;re as lifeless as a doornail, while,&#10;seeing that you weren&#39;t born to be a master, you&#39;ll all your life&#10;continue chattering in corners, like a plummet swinging at the end&#10;of a string!&#39; Yes, and that was true enough.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Lastly, after another pause the Morduine concluded:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No matter. He is not such a bad sort.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;My own position among these men was a position of some&#10;awkwardness, for, a young fellow of only fifteen, I had been&#10;appointed by the contractor, a distant relative of mine, to the&#10;task of superintending the expenditure of material. That is to say,&#10;I had to see to it that the carpenters did not make away with&#10;nails, or dispose of planks in return for drink. Yet all the time&#10;my presence was practically useless, seeing that the men stole&#10;nails as though I were not even in existence and strove to show me&#10;that among them I was a person too many, a sheer incubus, and&#10;seized every opportunity of giving me covert jogs with a beam, and&#10;similarly affronting me.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;This, of course, made my relations with them highly difficult,&#10;embarrassing, and irksome; and though moments occurred when I&#10;longed to say something that might ingratiate me, and endeavoured&#10;to effect an advance in that direction, the words always failed me&#10;at the necessary juncture, and I found myself lying crushed as&#10;before under a burdensome sense of the superfluity of my&#10;existence.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Again, if ever I tried to make an entry as to some material&#10;which had been used, Ossip would approach me, and, for instance,&#10;say:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Is it jotted down, eh? Then let me look at it.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And, eyeing the notebook with a frown, he would add vaguely:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What a nice hand you write!&#34; (He himself could write only in&#10;printing fashion, in the large scriptory characters of the&#10;Ecclesiastical Rubric, not in those of the ordinary kind.)&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;For example, that scoop there&#8212;what does IT say?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It is the word &#39;Good.&#39;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;&#39;Good&#39;? But what a slip-knot of a thing! And what are those&#10;words THERE, on THAT line?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;They say, &#39;Planks, 1 vershok by 9 arshini, 5.&#39;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No, six was the number used.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No, five.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Five? Why, the soldier broke one, didn&#39;t he?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, but never mind&#8212;at least it wasn&#39;t a plank that was&#10;wanted.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh! Well, I may tell you that he took the two pieces to the&#10;tavern to get drink with.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then, glancing into my face with his cornflower-blue eyes and&#10;quiet, quizzical smile, he would say without the least confusion as&#10;he twisted the ringlets of his beard:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Put down &#39;6.&#39; And see here, young cockerel. The weather has&#10;turned wet and cold, and the work is hard, and sometimes folk need&#10;to have their spirits cheered and raised with a drop of liquor. So&#10;don&#39;t you be too hard upon us, for God won&#39;t think the more of you&#10;for being strict.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And as he thus talked to me in his slow and kindly, but&#10;semi-affected, fashion&#8212;bespattering me, as it were, with wordy&#10;sawdust&#8212;I would suddenly grow blind of an eye and silently show him&#10;the corrected figure.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That&#39;s it&#8212;that&#39;s right. And how fine the figure looks now, as&#10;it squats there like a merchant&#39;s buxom, comely dame!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then he would be seen triumphantly telling his mates of his&#10;success; then, I would find myself feeling acutely conscious of the&#10;fact that everyone was despising me for my complacence Yes, grown&#10;sick beyond endurance with a yearning for some thing which it could&#10;not descry, my fifteen-year-old heart would dissolve in a flood of&#10;mortified tears, and there would pass through my brain the&#10;despondent, aching thought:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh, what a sad, uncomfortable world is this! How should Ossip&#10;have known so well that I should not re-correct the 6 into a 5, or&#10;that I should not tell the contractor that the men have bartered a&#10;plank for liquor?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Again, there befell an occasion when the men stole two pounds&#39;&#10;weight of five vershok mandrels and bolts.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Look here,&#34; I said to Ossip warningly. &#34;I am going to report&#10;this.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;All right,&#34; he agreed with a twitch of his grey eyebrows.&#10;&#34;Though what such a trifle can matter I fail to see. Yes, go and&#10;report every mother&#39;s son of them.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And to the men themselves he shouted:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Hi, boobies! Each of you now stands docked for some mandrels&#10;and bolts.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why?&#34; was the old soldier&#39;s grim inquiry.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Because you DO so stand,&#34; carelessly retorted the other.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With snarls thereafter, the men eyed me covertly, until I began&#10;to feel that very likely I should not do as I had threatened, and&#10;even that so to do might not be expedient.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But look here,&#34; said I to Ossip. &#34;I am going to give the&#10;contractor notice, and let all of you go to the devil. For if I&#10;were to remain with you much longer I too should become a&#10;thief.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Ossip stroked his beard awhile, and pondered. Then he seated&#10;himself beside me, and said in an undertone:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That is true.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But things are always so. The truth is that it&#39;s time you&#10;departed. What sort of a watchman, of a checker, are you? In jobs&#10;of this kind what a man needs to know is the meaning of property.&#10;He needs to have in him the spirit of a dog, so that he shall look&#10;after his master&#39;s stuff as he would look after the skin which his&#10;mother has put on to his own body. But you, you young puppy,&#10;haven&#39;t the slightest notion of what property means. In fact, were&#10;anyone to go and tell Vasili Sergeitch about the way in which you&#10;keep letting us off, he&#39;d give it you in the neck. Yes, you&#39;re no&#10;good to him at all, but just an expense: whereas when a man serves&#10;a master he ought, do you understand, to be PROFITABLE to that&#10;master.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He rolled and handed me a cigarette.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Smoke this,&#34; said he, &#34;and perhaps it&#39;ll make your brain work&#10;easier. If only you had been of a less awkward, uncomfortable&#10;nature, I should have said to you, &#39;Go and join the priests; but,&#10;as things are, you aren&#39;t the right sort for that&#8212;you&#39;re too stiff&#10;and unbending, and would never make headway even with an abbot. No,&#10;you&#39;re not the sort to play cards with. A monk is like a jackdaw&#8212;he&#10;chatters without knowing what he is chattering about, and pays no&#10;heed to the root of things, so busy is he with stuffing himself&#10;full with the grain. I say this to you with absolute earnestness,&#10;for I perceive you to be strange to our ways&#8212;a cuckoo that has&#10;blundered into the wrong nest.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And, doffing his cap, a gesture which he never failed to execute&#10;when he had something particularly important to say, he added&#10;humbly and sonorously as he glanced at the grey firmament:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;In the sight of the Lord our ways are the ways of thieves, and&#10;such as will never gain of Him salvation.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And that is true enough,&#34; responded Mokei Budirin after the&#10;fashion of a clarionet.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;From that time forth, Ossip of the curly, silvered head, bright&#10;eyes, and shadowy soul became an object of agreeable interest for&#10;me. Indeed, there grew up between us a species of friendship, even&#10;though I could see that a civil bearing towards me in public was a&#10;thing that it hurt him to maintain. At all events, in the presence&#10;of others he avoided my glance, and his eyes, clear, unsullied, and&#10;fight blue in tint, wavered unsteadily, and his lips twitched and&#10;assumed an artificially unpleasant expression, while he uttered&#10;some such speech as:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Hi, you Makarei, see that you keep your eyes open, and cam your&#10;pay, or that pig of a soldier will be making away with more&#10;nails!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But at other times, when we were alone together, he would speak&#10;to me kindly and instructively, while his eyes would dance and&#10;gleam with a faint, grave, knowing smile, and dart blue rays direct&#10;into mine, while for my part, as I listened to his words, I took&#10;every one of them to be absolutely true and balanced, despite their&#10;strange delivery.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;A man&#39;s duty consists in being good,&#34; I remarked on one&#10;occasion.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, of course,&#34; assented Ossip, though the next moment he&#10;veiled his eyes with a smile, and added in an undertone: &#34;But what&#10;do you understand by the term &#39;good&#39;? In my opinion, unless virtue&#10;be to their advantage, folk spit upon that &#39;goodness,&#39; that&#10;&#39;honourableness,&#39; of yours. Hence, the better plan is to pay folk&#10;court, and be civil to them, and flatter and cajole every mother&#39;s&#10;son of them. Yes, do that, and your &#39;goodness&#39; will have a chance&#10;of bringing you in some return. Not that I do not say that to be&#10;&#39;good,&#39; to be able to look your own ugly jowl in the face in a&#10;mirror, is pleasant enough; but, as I see the matter, it is all one&#10;to other people whether you be a cardsharper or a priest so long as&#10;you&#39;re polite, and let down your neighbours lightly. That&#39;s what&#10;they want.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For my part I never, at that period, grew weary of watching my&#10;fellows, for it was my constant idea that some day one of them&#10;would be able to raise me to a higher level, and to bring me to an&#10;understanding of this unintelligible and complicated existence of&#10;ours. Hence I kept asking myself the restless, the importunate&#10;question:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What precisely is the human soul?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Certain souls, I thought, existed which seemed like balls of&#10;copper, for, solid and immovable, they reflected things from their&#10;own point of view alone, in a dull and irregular and distorted&#10;fashion. And souls, I thought, existed which seemed as flat as&#10;mirrors, and, for all intents and purposes, had no existence at&#10;all.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And in every case the human soul seemed formless, like a cloud,&#10;and as murkily mutable as an imitation opal, a thing which altered&#10;according to the colour of what adjoined it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Only as regarded the soul of the intelligent Ossip was I&#10;absolutely at a loss, absolutely unable to reach a conclusion.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Pondering these and similar matters in my mind, I, on the day of&#10;which I speak, stood gazing at the river, and at the town under the&#10;hill, as I listened to the bells. Rearing themselves aloft like the&#10;organ pipes in my favourite Polish-Roman Catholic church, the&#10;steeples of the town had their crosses dimly sparkling as though&#10;the latter had been stars imprisoned in a murky sky. Yet it was as&#10;though those stars hoped eventually to ascend into the purer&#10;firmament above the wind-torn clouds that they sparkled; and as I&#10;stood watching the clouds glide onward, and momentarily efface with&#10;their shadows, the town&#39;s multifarious hues, I marked the fact that&#10;although, whenever dark-blue cavities in their substance permitted&#10;the beams of the sun to illuminate the buildings below, those&#10;buildings&#39; roofs assumed tints of increased cheerfulness. The&#10;clouds seemed to glide the faster to veil the beams, while the&#10;humid shadows grew more opaque&#8212;and the scene darkened as though&#10;only for a moment had it assumed a semblance of joy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The buildings of the town (looking like heaps of muddy snow),&#10;the black, naked earth around those buildings, the trees in the&#10;gardens, the hummocks of piled-up soil, the dull grey glimmer of&#10;the window panes of the houses&#8212;all these things reminded me of&#10;winter, even though the misty breath of the northern spring was&#10;beginning to steal over the whole.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Presently a young fellow with flaxen hair, a pendent underlip,&#10;and a tall, ungainly figure, by name Mishuk Diatlov, essayed to&#10;troll the stanza:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p class=&#34;poem&#34;&#62;&#34;That morn to him the maiden came,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;To find his soul had fled.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Whereupon the old soldier shouted:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Hi, you! Have you forgotten the day?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And even Boev saw fit to take umbrage at the singing, and,&#10;threatening Diatlov with his fist, to rap out:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ah, sobatchnia dusha!&#34; [&#34;Soul of a dog.&#34;]&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What a rude, rough, primitive lot we Russians are!&#34; commented&#10;Ossip, seating himself atop of the icebreaker, and screwing up his&#10;eyes to measure its fall. &#34;To speak plainly, we Russians are sheer&#10;barbarians. Once upon a time, I may tell you, an anchorite happened&#10;to be on his travels; and as the people came pressing around him,&#10;and kneeling to him, and tearfully beseeching him with the words,&#10;&#39;Oh holy father, intercede for us with the wolves which are&#10;devouring our substance!&#39; he replied: &#39;Ha! Are you, or are you not,&#10;Orthodox Christians? See that I assign you not to condign&#10;perdition!&#39; Yes, angry, in very truth he was. Nay, he even spat in&#10;the people&#39;s faces. Yet in reality he was a kindly old man, for his&#10;eyes kept shedding tears equally with theirs.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Twenty sazheni below the icebreaker was a gang of barefooted&#10;sailors, engaged in hacking out the floes from under their barges;&#10;and as they shattered the brittle, greyish-blue crust on the river,&#10;the mattocks rang out, and the sharp blades of the icecutters&#10;gleamed as they thrust the broken fragments under the surface.&#10;Meanwhile, there could be heard a bubbling of water, and the sound&#10;of rivulets trickling down to the sandy margin of the river. And&#10;similarly among our own gang was there audible a scraping of&#10;planes, and a screeching of saws, and a clattering of iron braces&#10;as they were driven into the smooth yellow wood, while through all&#10;the web of these sounds there ran the ceaseless song of the bells,&#10;a song so softened by distance as to thrill the soul, much as&#10;though dingy, burdensome labour were holding revel in honour of&#10;spring, and calling upon the latter to spread itself over the&#10;starved, naked surface of the gradually thawing ground.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At this point someone shouted hoarsely:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Go and fetch the German. We have not got hands enough.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And from the bank someone bawled in reply:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Where IS he?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;In the tavern. That is where you must go and look for him.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And as they made themselves heard, the voices floated up&#10;turgidly into the sodden air, spread themselves over the river&#39;s&#10;mournful void, and died away.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Meanwhile our men worked with industry and speed, but not&#10;without a fault or two, for their thoughts were fixed upon the town&#10;and its washhouses and churches. And particularly restless was&#10;Sashok Diatlov, a man whose hair, as flaxen as that of his brother,&#10;seemed to have been boiled in lye. At intervals, glancing up-river,&#10;this well-built, sturdy young fellow would say softly to his&#10;brother:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It&#39;s cracking now, eh?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And, certainly, the ice had &#34;moved&#34; two nights ago, so that&#10;since yesterday morning the river watchmen had refused to permit&#10;horsed vehicles to cross, and only a few beadlike pedestrians now&#10;were making their way along the marked-out ice paths, while, as&#10;they proceeded, one could hear the water slapping against the&#10;planks as the latter bent under the travellers&#39; weight.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, it IS cracking,&#34; at length Mishuk replied with a hoist of&#10;his ginger eyebrows.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Ossip too scanned the river from under his hand. Then he said to&#10;Mishuk:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Pah! It is the dry squeak of the planes in your own hand that&#10;you keep hearing, so go on with your work, you son of a beldame.&#10;And as for you, Inspector, do you help me to speed up the men&#10;instead of burying your nose in your notebook.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;By this time there remained only two more hours for work, and&#10;the arch of the icebreaker had been wholly sheathed in&#10;butter-tinted scantlings, and nothing required to be added to it&#10;save the great iron braces. Unfortunately, Boev and Saniavin, the&#10;men who had been engaged upon the task of cutting out the sockets&#10;for the braces, had worked so amiss, and run their lines so&#10;straight, that, when it came to the point, the arms of the braces&#10;refused to sink properly into the wood.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh, you cock-eyed fool of a Morduine!&#34; shouted Ossip, smiting&#10;his fist against the side of his cap. &#34;Do you call THAT sort of&#10;thing work?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At this juncture there came from somewhere on the bank a&#10;seemingly exultant shout of:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ah! NOW it&#39;s giving way!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And almost at the same moment, there stole over the river a sort&#10;of rustle, a sort of quiet crunching which made the projecting pine&#10;branches quiver as though they were trying to catch at something,&#10;while, shouldering their mattocks, the barefooted sailors noisily&#10;hastened aboard their barges with the aid of rope ladders.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And then curious indeed was it to see how many people suddenly&#10;came into view on the river&#8212;to see how they appeared to issue from&#10;below the very ice itself, and, hurrying to and fro like jackdaws&#10;startled by the shot of a gun, to dart hither and thither, and to&#10;seize up planks and boathooks, and to throw them down again, and&#10;once more to seize them up.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Put the tools together,&#34; Ossip shouted. &#34;And look alive there,&#10;and make for the bank.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Aye, and a fine Easter Day it will be for us on THAT bank!&#34;&#10;growled Sashok.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Meanwhile, it was the river rather than the town that seemed to&#10;be motionless&#8212;the latter had begun, as it were, to quiver and reel,&#10;and, with the hill above it, to appear to be gliding slowly up&#10;stream, even as the grey, sandy bank some ten sazheni from us was&#10;beginning to grow tremulous, and to recede.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Run, all of you!&#34; shouted Ossip, giving me a violent push as he&#10;did so. Then to myself in particular he added: &#34;Why stand gaping&#10;there?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;This caused a keen sense of danger to strike home in my heart,&#10;and to make my feet feel as though already the ice was escaping&#10;their tread. So, automatically picking themselves up, those feet&#10;started to bear my body in the direction of a spot on the sandy&#10;bank where the winter-stripped branches of a willow tree were&#10;writhing, and whither there were betaking themselves also Boev, the&#10;old soldier, Budirin, and the brothers Diatlov. Meanwhile the&#10;Morduine ran by my side, cursing vigorously as he did so, and Ossip&#10;followed us, walking backwards.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No, no, Narodetz,&#34; he said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But, my good Ossip&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Never mind. What has to be, has to be.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But, as likely as not, we may remain stuck here for two&#10;days!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Never mind even if we DO remain stuck here.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But what of the festival?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It will have, for this year at least, to be kept without&#10;you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Seating himself on the sand, the old soldier lit his pipe and&#10;growled:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What cowards you all are! The bank was only fifteen sazheni&#10;from us, yet you ran as though possessed!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;With you yourself as leader,&#34; put in Mokei.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The old soldier took no notice, but added:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What were you all afraid of? Once upon a time Christ Himself,&#10;Our Little Father, died.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And rose again,&#34; muttered the Morduine with a tinge of&#10;resentment. Which led Boev to exclaim:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Puppy, hold your tongue! What right have you to air your&#10;opinions?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Besides, this is Good Friday, not Easter Day,&#34; the old soldier&#10;concluded with severe, didactical mien.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In a gap of blue between the clouds there was shining the March&#10;sun, and everywhere the ice was sparkling as though in derision of&#10;ourselves. Shading his eyes, Ossip gazed at the dissolving river,&#10;and said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, it IS rising&#8212;but that will not last for long.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No, but long enough to make us miss the festival,&#34; grumbled&#10;Sashok.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Upon this the smooth, beardless face of the youthful Morduine, a&#10;face dark and angular like the skin of an unpeeled potato, assumed&#10;a resentful frown, and, blinking his eyes, he muttered:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, here we may have to sit&#8212;here where there&#39;s neither food&#10;nor money! Other folk will be enjoying themselves, but we shall&#10;have to remain hugging our hungry stomachs like a pack of&#10;dogs!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Meanwhile Ossip&#39;s eyes had remained fixed upon the river, for&#10;evidently his thoughts were far away, and it was in absentminded&#10;fashion that he replied:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Hunger cannot be considered where necessity impels. By the way,&#10;what use are our damned icebreakers? For the protection of barges&#10;and such? Why, the ice hasn&#39;t the sense to care. It just goes&#10;sliding over a barge, and farewell is the word to THAT bit of&#10;property!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Damn it, but none of us have a barge for property, have we?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You had better go and talk to a fool.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The truth is that the icebreaker ought to have been taken in&#10;hand sooner.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Finally, the old soldier made a queer grimace, and&#10;ejaculated:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Blockhead!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;From a barge a knot of sailors shouted something, and at the&#10;same moment the river sent forth a sort of whiff of cruel&#10;chilliness and brooding calm. The disposition of the pine boughs&#10;now had changed. Nay, everything in sight was beginning to assume a&#10;different air, as though everything were charged with tense&#10;expectancy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;One of the younger men asked diffidently, beneath his&#10;breath:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Mate Ossip, what are we going to do?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What do you say?&#34; Ossip queried absent-mindedly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I say, what are we going to do? Just to sit here?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;To this Boev responded, with loud, nasal derision in his&#10;tone:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, my lad, for the Lord has seen fit to prevent you from&#10;participating in His most holy festival.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And the old soldier, in support of his mate, extended his pipe&#10;towards the river, and muttered with a grin:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You want to cross to the town, do you? Well, be off with you,&#10;and though the ice may give way beneath your feet and drown you, at&#10;least you&#39;ll be taken to the police station, and so get to your&#10;festival. For that&#39;s what you want, I suppose?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;True enough,&#34; Mokei re-echoed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then the sun went in, and the river grew darker, while the town&#10;stood out more clearly. Ceaselessly, the younger men gazed towards&#10;the town with wistful, gloomy eyes, though silently they remained&#10;where they were.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Similarly, I myself was beginning to find things irksome and&#10;uncomfortable, as always happens when a number of companions are&#10;thinking different thoughts, and contain in themselves none of that&#10;unity of will which alone can join men into a direct, uniform&#10;force. Rather, I felt as though I could gladly leave my companions&#10;and start out upon the ice alone.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Suddenly Ossip recovered his faculties. Rising, then doffing his&#10;cap and making the sign of the cross in the direction of the town,&#10;he said with a quiet, simple, yet somehow authoritative, air:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Very well, my mates. Go in peace, and may the Lord go with&#10;you!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But whither?&#34; asked Sashok, leaping to his feet. &#34;To the&#10;town?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Whither else?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The old soldier was the only one not to rise, and with&#10;conviction he remarked:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It will result but in our getting drowned.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Then stay where you are.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Ossip glanced around the party. Then he continued:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Bestir yourselves! Look alive!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Upon which all crowded together, and Boev, thrusting the tools&#10;into a hole in the bank, groaned:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The order &#39;go&#39; has been given, so go we MUST, well though a man&#10;in receipt of such an order might ask himself, &#39;How is it going to&#10;be done?&#39;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Ossip seemed, in some way, to have grown younger and more&#10;active, while the habitually shy, though good-humoured, expression&#10;of his countenance was gone from his ruddy features, and his&#10;darkened eyes had assumed an air of stern activity. Nay, even his&#10;indolent, rolling gait had disappeared, and in his step there was&#10;more firmness, more assurance, than had ever before been the&#10;case.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Let every man take a plank,&#34; he said, &#34;and hold it in front of&#10;him. Then, should anyone fall in (which God forbid!), the&#10;plank-ends will catch upon the ice to either side of him, and hold&#10;him up. Also, every man must avoid cracks in the ice. Yes, and is&#10;there a rope handy? Here, Narodetz! Reach me that spirit-level. Is&#10;everyone ready? I will walk first, and next there must come&#8212;well,&#10;which is the heaviest?&#8212;you, soldier, and then Mokei, and then the&#10;Morduine, and then Boev, and then Mishuk, and then Sashok, and then&#10;Makarei, the lightest of all. And do you all take off your caps&#10;before starting, and say a prayer to the Mother of God. Ha! Here is&#10;Old Father Sun coming out to greet us.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Readily did the men bare their tousled grey or flaxen heads as&#10;momentarily the sun glanced through a bank of thin white vapour&#10;before again concealing himself, as though averse to arousing any&#10;false hopes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Now!&#34; sharply commanded Ossip in his new-found voice. &#34;And may&#10;God go with us! Watch my feet, and don&#39;t crowd too much upon one&#10;another, but keep each at a sazhen&#39;s distance or more&#8212;in fact, the&#10;more the better. Yes, come, mates!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With which, stuffing his cap into his bosom, and grasping the&#10;spirit-level in his hands, Ossip set foot upon the ice with a&#10;sliding, cautious, shuffling gait. At the same moment, there came&#10;from the bank behind us a startled cry of:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Where are you off to, you fools?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Never mind,&#34; said Ossip to ourselves. &#34;Come along with you, and&#10;don&#39;t stand staring.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You blockheads!&#34; the voice repeated. &#34;You had far better&#10;return.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No, no! come on!&#34; was Ossip&#39;s counter-command. &#34;And as you move&#10;think of God, or you&#39;ll never find yourselves among the invited&#10;guests at His holy festival of Eastertide.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Next Ossip sounded a police whistle, which act led the old&#10;soldier to exclaim:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh, that&#39;s the way, mate! Good! Yes, you know what to do. Now&#10;notice will have been given to the police on the further bank, and,&#10;if we&#39;re not drowned, we shall find ourselves clapped in gaol when&#10;we get there. However, I&#39;m not responsible.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In spite of this remonstrance, Ossip&#39;s sturdy voice drew his&#10;companions after him as though they had been tied to a rope.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Watch your feet carefully,&#34; once more he cried.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Our line of march was directed obliquely, and in the opposite&#10;direction to the current. Also, I, as the rearmost of the party,&#10;found it pleasant to note how the wary little Ossip of the silvery&#10;head went looping over the ice with the deftness of a hare, and&#10;practically no raising of the feet, while behind him there trailed,&#10;in wild-goose fashion, and as though tied to a single invisible&#10;string, six dark and undulating figures the shadows of which kept&#10;making themselves visible on the ice, from those figures&#39; feet to&#10;points indefinitely remote. And as we proceeded, all of us kept our&#10;heads lowered as though we had been descending from a mountain in&#10;momentary fear of a false step.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Also, though the shouting in our rear kept growing in volume,&#10;and we could tell that by this time a crowd had gathered, not a&#10;word could we distinguish, but only a sort of ugly din.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In time our cautious march became for me a mere, mechanical,&#10;wearisome task, for on ordinary occasions it was my custom to&#10;maintain a pace of greater rapidity. Thus, eventually I sank into&#10;the semiconscious condition amid which the soul turns to vacuity,&#10;and one no longer thinks of oneself, but, on the contrary issues&#10;from one&#39;s personality, and begins to see objects with unwonted&#10;clarity, and to hear sounds with unwonted precision. Under my feet&#10;the seams in the blue-grey, leaden ice lay full of water, while as&#10;for the ice itself, it was blinding in its expansive glitter, even&#10;though in places it had come to be either cracked or bulbous, or&#10;had ground itself into powder with its own movement, or had become&#10;heaped into slushy hummocks of pumice-like sponginess and the&#10;consistency of broken glass. And everywhere around me I could&#10;discern the chilly, gaping smile of blue crevices which caught at&#10;my feet, and rendered the tread of my boot-soles unstable. And&#10;ever, as we marched, could the voices of Boev and the old soldier&#10;be heard speaking in antiphony, like two pipes being fluted by one&#10;and the same pair of lips.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I won&#39;t be responsible,&#34; said the one voice.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Nor I,&#34; responded the other.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The only reason why I have come is that I was told to do so.&#10;That&#39;s all about it.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, and the same with me.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;One man gives an order, and another man, perhaps a man a&#10;thousand times more sensible than he, is forced to obey it.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Is any man, in these days, sensible, seeing what a racket we&#10;have to live among?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;By this time Ossip had tucked the skirts of his greatcoat into&#10;his belt, while beneath those skirts his legs (clad in grey cloth&#10;gaiters of a military pattern) were shuffling along as lightly and&#10;easily as springs, and in a manner that suggested that there was&#10;turning and twisting in front of him some person whom, though&#10;desirous of barring to him the direct course, the shortest route,&#10;Ossip successfully opposed and evaded by dint of dodges and&#10;deviations to right and left, and occasional turns about, and the&#10;execution of dance steps and loops and semicircles. Meanwhile in&#10;the tones of Ossip&#39;s voice there was a soft, musical ring that&#10;struck agreeably upon the ear, and harmonised to admiration with&#10;the song of the bells just when we were approaching the middle of&#10;the river&#39;s breadth of four hundred sazheni. There resounded over&#10;the surface of the ice a vicious rustle while a piece of ice slid&#10;from under my feet. Stumbling, and powerless to retain my footing,&#10;I blundered down upon my knees in helpless astonishment; and then,&#10;as I glanced upstream, fear gripped at my throat, deprived me of&#10;speech, and darkened all my vision. For the whole substance of the&#10;grey ice-core had come to life and begun to heave itself upwards!&#10;Yes, the hitherto level surface was thrusting forth sharp angular&#10;ridges, and the air seemed full of a strange sound like the&#10;trampling of some heavy being over broken glass.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With a quiet trickle there came a swirl of water around me,&#10;while an adjacent pine bough cracked and squeaked as though it too&#10;had come to life. My companions shouted, and collected into a knot;&#10;whereupon, at once dominating and quelling the tense, painful&#10;hubbub of sounds, there rang forth the voice of Ossip.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Mother of God!&#34; he shouted. &#34;Scatter, lads! Get away from one&#10;another, and keep each to himself! Now! Courage!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With that, springing towards us as though wasps had been after&#10;him, and grasping the spirit-level as though it had been a weapon,&#10;he jabbed it to every side, as though fighting invisible foes,&#10;while, just as the quivering town began, seemingly, to glide past&#10;us, and the ice at my feet gave a screech and crumbled to fragments&#10;beneath me, so that water bubbled to my knees. I leapt up from&#10;where I was, and rushed blindly in Ossip&#39;s direction.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Where are you coming to, fool?&#34; was his shout as he brandished&#10;the spirit-level. &#34;Stand still where you are!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Indeed, Ossip seemed no longer to be Ossip at all, but a person&#10;curiously younger, a person in whom all that had been familiar in&#10;Ossip had become effaced. Yes, the once blue eyes had turned to&#10;grey, and the figure added half an arshin to its stature as,&#10;standing as erect as a newly made nail, and pressing both feet&#10;together, the foreman stretched himself to his full height, and&#10;shouted with his mouth open to its widest extent:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Don&#39;t shuffle about, nor crowd upon one another, or I&#39;ll break&#10;your heads!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Whereafter, of myself in particular, he inquired as he raised&#10;the spirit-level:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What is the matter with YOU, pray?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I am feeling frightened,&#34; I muttered in response.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Feeling frightened of WHAT, indeed?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Of being drowned.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Pooh! Just you hold your tongue.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Yet the next moment he glanced at me, and added in a gentler,&#10;quieter tone:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;None but a fool gets drowned. Pick yourself up and come&#10;along.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then once more he shouted full-throated words of encouragement&#10;to his men; and as he did so, his chest swelled and his head rocked&#10;with the effort.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Yet, crackling and cracking, the ice was breaking up; and soon&#10;it began slowly to bear us past the town. &#39;Twas as though some&#10;unknown force ashore had awakened, and was striving to tear the&#10;banks of the river in two, so much did the portion of the landscape&#10;downstream seem to be standing still while the portion level with&#10;us seemed to be receding in the opposite direction, and thus&#10;causing a break to take place in the middle of the picture.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And soon this movement, a movement agonisingly slow, deprived me&#10;of my sense of being connected with the rest of the world, until,&#10;as the whole receded, despair again gripped my heart and unnerved&#10;my limbs. Roseate clouds were gliding across the sky and causing&#10;stray fragments of the ice, which, seemingly, yearned to engulf me,&#10;to assume reflected tints of a similar hue. Yes, it was as though&#10;the birth of spring had reawakened the universe, and was causing it&#10;to stretch itself, and to emit deep, hurried, broken pants that&#10;cracked its bones as the river, embedded in the earth&#39;s stout&#10;framework, revivified the whole with thick, turbulent, ebullient&#10;blood.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And this sense of littleness, of impotence amid the calm,&#10;assured movement of the earth&#39;s vast bulk, weighed upon my soul,&#10;and evoked, and momentarily fanned to flame in me, the shameless&#10;human question: &#34;What if I should stretch forth my hand and lay it&#10;upon the hill and the banks of the river, and say, &#39;Halt until I&#10;come to you!&#39;?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Meanwhile the bells continued the mournful moaning of their&#10;resonant, coppery notes; and that moaning led me to reflect that&#10;within two days (on the night of the morrow) they would be pealing&#10;a joyous welcome to the Resurrection Feast.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh that all of us may live to hear that sound!&#34; was my unspoken&#10;thought.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Before my vision there kept quavering seven dark figures&#8212;figures&#10;shuffling over the ice, and brandishing planks like oars. And,&#10;wriggling like a lamprey in front of them was a little old fellow,&#10;an old fellow resembling Saint Nicholas the Wonder-Worker, an old&#10;fellow who kept crying softly, but authoritatively:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Do not stare about you!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And ever the river was growing rougher and ruder; ever its&#10;backbone was beginning to puiver and flounder like a whale&#10;underfoot, with its liquescent body of cold, grey, murky water&#10;bursting with increasing frequency from its shell of ice, and&#10;lapping hungrily at our feet.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Yes, we were human beings traversing, as it were, a slender pole&#10;over a bottomless abyss; and as we walked, the water&#39;s soft,&#10;cantabile splash set me in mind of the depths below, of the&#10;infinite time during which a body would continue sinking through&#10;dense, chilly bulk until sight faded and the heart stopped beating.&#10;Yes, before my mind&#39;s eye there arose men drowned and devoured by&#10;crayfish, men with crumbling skulls and swollen features, and&#10;glassy, bulging eyes and puffy hands and outstretched fingers and&#10;palms of which the skin had rotted off with the damp.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The first to fall in was Mokei Budirin. He had been walking next&#10;ahead of the Morduine, and, as a man habitually silent and&#10;absorbed, proceeding on his way more quietly than the rest.&#10;Suddenly something had seemed to catch at his legs, and he had&#10;disappeared until only his head and his hands, as the latter&#10;clutched at his plank, had been left above-level.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Run and help him, somebody!&#34; was Ossip&#39;s instant cry. &#34;Yes, but&#10;not all of you&#8212;just one or two. Help him I say!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The spluttering Mokei, however, said to the Morduine and&#10;myself:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No; do you move away, mates, for I shall best help myself.&#10;Never you mind.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And, sure enough, he did succeed in drawing himself out on to&#10;the ice without assistance. Whereafter he remarked as he shook&#10;himself:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;A nice pickle, this, to be in! I might as well have been&#10;drowned!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And, in fact, at the moment he looked, with his chattering teeth&#10;and great tongue licking a dripping moustache, precisely like a&#10;large, good-natured dog.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then I remembered how, a month earlier, he had accidentally&#10;driven the blade of his axe through the joint of his left thumb,&#10;and, merely picking up the white fragment of flesh with the nail&#10;turning blue, and scanning it with his unfathomable eyes, had&#10;remarked, as though it was he himself that had been at fault:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;How often before I have injured that thumb, I could not say.&#10;And when once I dislocated it, I went on working with it longer&#10;than was right&#8230; . Now I will go and bury it.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With which, carefully wrapping up the fragment in some shavings,&#10;he had thrust the whole into his pocket, and bandaged the wounded&#10;hand.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Similarly, after that, did Boev, the man next in order behind&#10;Mokei, contrive to wrest himself from the grasp of the ice, though,&#10;on immersion, he started bawling, &#34;Mates, I shall drown! I am dead&#10;already! Help me, help me!&#34; and became so cramped with terror as to&#10;be extricated only with great difficulty, while amid the general&#10;confusion the Morduine too nearly slipped into the water.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;A narrow shave of saying Vespers tonight with the devils in&#10;Hell!&#34; he remarked as he clambered back, and stood grinning with an&#10;even more angular and attenuated appearance than usual.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The next moment Boev achieved a second plunge, and screamed, as&#10;before, for help.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Don&#39;t shout, you goat of a Yashka!&#34; Ossip exclaimed as he&#10;threatened him with the spirit-level. &#34;Why scare people? I&#39;ll give&#10;it you! Look here, lads. Let every man take off his belt and turn&#10;out his pockets. Then he&#39;ll walk lighter.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Toothed jaws gaped and crunched at us at every step, and vomited&#10;thick spittle; at every tenth step their keen blue fangs reached&#10;for our lives. Meanwhile, the soaked condition of our boots and&#10;clothes had rendered us as slimy as though smeared with paste.&#10;Also, it so weighed us down as to hinder any active movement, and&#10;to cause each step to be taken cautiously, slowly, silently, and&#10;with ponderous diffidence.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Yet, soaked though we were, Ossip might verily have known the&#10;number of cracks in advance, so smooth and harelike was his&#10;progress from floe to floe as at intervals he faced about, watched&#10;us, and cried sonorously:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That&#39;s the way to do it, eh?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Yes, he absolutely played with the river, and though it kept&#10;catching at his diminutive form, he always evaded it, circumvented&#10;its movements, and avoided its snares. Nay, capable even of&#10;directing its trend did he seem, and of thrusting under our feet&#10;only the largest and firmest floes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Lads, there is no need to be downhearted,&#34; he would cry at&#10;intervals.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ah, that brave Ossip!&#34; the Morduine once ejaculated. &#34;In very&#10;truth is he a man, and no mistake! Just look at him!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The closer we approached the further shore, the thinner and the&#10;more brittle did the ice become, and the more liable we to break&#10;through it. By this time the town had nearly passed us, and we were&#10;bidding fair to be carried out into the Volga, where the ice would&#10;still be sound, and, as likely as not, draw us under itself.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;By your leave, we are going to be drowned,&#34; the Morduine&#10;murmured as he glanced at the blue shadow of eventide on our&#10;left.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And simultaneously, as though compassionating our lot, a large&#10;floe grounded upon the bank, glided upwards with a cracking and a&#10;crashing, and there held fast!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Run, all of you!&#34; came a furious shout from Ossip. &#34;Hurry up,&#10;now! Put your very best legs foremost!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For myself, as I sprang upon the floe I lost my footing, and,&#10;falling headlong and remaining seated on the hither end of the floe&#10;amid a shower of spray, saw five of my seven comrades rush past,&#10;pushing and jostling, as they made for the shore. But presently the&#10;Morduine turned and halted beside me, with the intention of&#10;rendering Ossip assistance.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Run, you young fools!&#34; the latter exclaimed. &#34;Come! Be off with&#10;you!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Somehow in his face there was now a livid, uncertain air, while&#10;his eyes had lost their fire, and his mouth was curiously&#10;agape.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No, mate. Do YOU get up,&#34; was my counter-adjuration.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Unfortunately, I have hurt my leg,&#34; he replied with his head&#10;bent down. &#34;In fact, I am not sure that I can get up.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;However, we contrived to raise him and carry him ashore with an&#10;arm of his resting on each of our necks. Meanwhile he growled with&#10;chattering teeth:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Aha, you river devils! Drown me if you can! But I&#39;ve not given&#10;you a chance, the Lord be thanked! Hi, look out! The ice won&#39;t bear&#10;the three of us. Mind how you step, and choose places where the ice&#10;is bare of snow. There it&#39;s firmer. No, a better plan still would&#10;be to leave me where I am.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Next, with a frowning scrutiny of my face, he inquired:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That notebook of our misdeeds&#8212;hasn&#39;t it had a wetting and got&#10;done for?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;That very moment, as we stepped from the stranded floe (in&#10;grounding, it had crushed and shattered a small boat), such part of&#10;it as lay in the water gave a loud crack, and, swaying to and fro,&#10;and emitting a gurgling sound, floated clear of the rest.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ah!&#34; was the Morduine&#39;s quizzical comment. &#34;YOU knew well&#10;enough what needed to be done.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Wet, and chilled to the bone, though relieved in spirit, we&#10;stepped ashore to find a crowd of townspeople in conversation with&#10;Boev and the old soldier. And as we deposited our charge under the&#10;lea of a pile of logs he shouted cheerfully:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Mates, Makarei&#39;s notebook is done for, soaked through!&#34; And&#10;since the notebook in question was weighing upon my breast like a&#10;brick, I pulled it out unseen, and hurled it far into the river&#10;with a plop like that of a frog.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As for the Diatlovs, they lost no time in setting out in search&#10;of vodka in the tavern on the hill, and slapped one another on the&#10;back as they ran, and could be heard shouting, &#34;Hurrah,&#10;hurrah!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Upon this, a tall old man with the beard of an apostle and the&#10;eyes of a brigand muttered:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Infidels, why disturb peaceful folk like this? You ought to be&#10;thrashed!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Whereupon Boev, who was changing his clothes, retorted:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What do you mean by &#39;disturb&#39;?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Besides,&#34; put in the old soldier, &#34;even though we are&#10;Christians like yourself, we might as well have been drowned for&#10;all that you did to help us.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What could we have done?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Meanwhile Ossip had remained lying on the ground with one leg&#10;stretched out at full length, and tremulous hands fumbling at his&#10;greatcoat as under his breath he muttered:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Holy Mother, how wet I am! My clothes, though I have only worn&#10;them a year, are ruined for ever!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Moreover, he seemed now to have shrunken again in stature&#8212;to&#10;have become crumpled up like a man run over. Indeed, as he lay he&#10;seemed actually to be melting, so continuously was his bulk&#10;decreasing in size.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But suddenly he raised himself to a sitting posture, groaned,&#10;and exclaimed in high-pitched, wrathful accents:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;May the devil take you all! Be off with you to your washhouses&#10;and churches! Yes, be off, for it seems that, as God couldn&#39;t keep&#10;His holy festival without you, I&#39;ve had to stand within an ace of&#10;death and to spoil my clothes-yes, all that you fellows should be&#10;got out of your fix!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Nevertheless, the men merely continued taking off their boots,&#10;and wringing out their clothes, and conversing with sundry gasps&#10;and grunts with the bystanders. So presently Ossip resumed:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What are you thinking of, you fools? The washhouse is the best&#10;place for you, for if the police get you, they&#39;ll soon find you a&#10;lodging, and no mistake!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;One of the townspeople put in officiously:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Aye, aye. The police have been sent for.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And this led Boev to exclaim to Ossip:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why pretend like that?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Pretend? I?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes&#8212;you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What do you mean?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I mean that it was you who egged us on to cross the river.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You say that it was I?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I do.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Indeed?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Aye,&#34; put in Budirin quietly, but incisively. And him the&#10;Morduine supported by saying in a sullen undertone:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It was you, mate. By God it was. It would seem that you have&#10;forgotten.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, you started all this business,&#34; the old soldier&#10;corroborated, in dour, ponderous accents.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Forgotten, indeed? HE?&#34; was Boev&#39;s heated exclamation.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;How can you say such a thing? Well, let him not try to shift&#10;the responsibility on to others&#8212;that&#39;s all! WE&#39;LL see, right&#10;enough, that he goes through with it!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;To this Ossip made no reply, but gazed frowningly at his&#10;dripping, half-clad men.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;All at once, with a curious outburst of mingled smiles and tears&#10;(it would be hard to say which), he shrugged his shoulders, threw&#10;up his hands, and muttered:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, it IS true. If it please you, it was I that contrived the&#10;idea.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Of COURSE it was!&#34; the old soldier cried triumphantly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Ossip turned his eyes again to where the river was seething like&#10;a bowl of porridge, and, letting his eyes fall with a frown,&#10;continued:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;In a moment of forgetfulness I did it. Yet how is it that we&#10;were not all drowned? Well, you wouldn&#39;t understand even if I were&#10;to tell you. No, by God, you wouldn&#39;t!&#8230; Don&#39;t be angry with me,&#10;mates. Pardon me for the festival&#39;s sake, for I am feeling uneasy&#10;of mind. Yes, I it was that egged you on to cross the river, the&#10;old fool that I was!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Aha!&#34; exclaimed Boev. &#34;But, had I been drowned, what should you&#10;have said THEN?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In fact, by this time Ossip seemed conscious to the full of the&#10;futility and the senselessness of what he had done: and in his&#10;state of sliminess, as he sat nodding his head, picking at the&#10;sand, looking at no one, and emitting a torrent of remorseful&#10;words, he reminded me strongly of a new-born calf.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And as I watched him I thought to myself:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Where now is the leader of men who could draw his fellows in&#10;his train with so much care and skill and authority?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And into my soul there trickled an uneasy sense of something&#10;lacking. Seating myself beside Ossip (for I desired still to retain&#10;a measure of my late impression of him), I said to him in an&#10;undertone:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Soon you will be all right again.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With a sideways glance he muttered in reply, as he combed his&#10;beard:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well, you saw what happened just now. Always do things so&#10;happen.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;While for the benefit of the men he added:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That was a good jest of mine, eh?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The summit of the hill which lay crouching, like a great beast,&#10;on the brink of the river was standing out clearly against the fast&#10;darkening sky; while a clump of trees thereon had grown black, and&#10;everywhere blue shadows of the spring eventide were coming into&#10;view, and looming between the housetops where the houses lay&#10;pressed like scabs against the hill&#39;s opaque surface, and peering&#10;from the moist, red jaws of the ravine which, gaping towards the&#10;river, seemed as though it were stretching forth for a draught of&#10;water.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Also, by now the rustling and crunching of the ice on the&#10;similarly darkening river was beginning to assume a deeper note,&#10;and at times a floe would thrust one of its extremities into the&#10;bank as a pig thrusts its snout into the earth, and there remain&#10;motionless before once more beginning to sway, tearing itself free,&#10;and floating away down the river as another such floe glided into&#10;its place.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And ever more and more swiftly was the water rising, and washing&#10;away soil from the bank, and spreading a thick sediment over the&#10;dark blue surface of the river. And as it did so, there resounded&#10;in the air a strange noise as of chewing and champing, a noise as&#10;though some huge wild animal were masticating, and licking itself&#10;with its great long tongue.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And still there continued to come from the town the melancholy,&#10;distance-softened, sweet-toned song of the bells.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Presently, the brothers Diatlov appeared descending from the&#10;hill with bottles in their hands, and sporting like a couple of&#10;joyous puppies, while to intercept them there could be seen&#10;advancing along the bank of the river a grey-coated police sergeant&#10;and two black-coated constables.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh Lord!&#34; groaned Ossip as he rubbed his knee.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As for the townsfolk, they had no love for the police, so&#10;hastened to withdraw to a little distance, where they silently&#10;awaited the officers&#39; approach. Before long the sergeant, a little,&#10;withered sort of a fellow with diminutive features and a sandy,&#10;stubby moustache, called out in gruff, stern, hoarse, laboured&#10;accents:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;So here you are, you rascals!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Ossip prised himself up from the ground with his elbow, and said&#10;hurriedly:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It was I that contrived the idea of the thing, your Excellency;&#10;but, pray let me off in honour of the festival.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What do you say, you&#8212;?&#34; the sergeant began, but his bluster was&#10;lost amid the swift flow of Ossip&#39;s further conciliatory words.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;We are folk of this town,&#34; Ossip continued, &#34;who tonight found&#10;ourselves stranded on the further bank, with nothing to buy bread&#10;with, even though the day after tomorrow will be Christ&#39;s day, the&#10;day when Christians like ourselves wish to clean themselves up a&#10;little, and to go to church. So I said to my mates, &#39;Be off with&#10;you, my good fellows, and may God send that no mishap befall you!&#39;&#10;And for this presumptuousness of mine I have been punished already,&#10;for, as you can see, have as good as broken my leg.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes,&#34; ejaculated the sergeant grimly. &#34;But if you had been&#10;drowned, what then?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Ossip sighed wearily.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What then, do you say, your Excellency? Why, then, nothing,&#10;with your permission.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;This led the officer to start railing at the culprit, while the&#10;crowd listened as silently and attentively as though he had been&#10;saying something worthy to be heard and heeded, rather than foully&#10;and cynically miscalling their mothers.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Lastly, our names having been noted, the police withdrew, while&#10;each of us drank a dram of vodka (and thereby gained a measure of&#10;warmth and comfort), and then began to make for our several homes.&#10;Ossip followed the police with derisive eyes; whereafter, he leapt&#10;to his feet with a nimble, adroit movement, and crossed himself&#10;with punctilious piety.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That&#39;s all about it, thank God!&#34; he exclaimed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What?&#34; sniggered Boev, now both disillusioned and astonished.&#10;&#34;Do you really mean to say that that leg of yours is better&#10;already? Or do you mean that it never was injured at all?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ah! So you wish that it HAD been injured, eh?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The rascal of a Petrushka!&#34; the other exclaimed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Now,&#34; commanded Ossip, &#34;do all of you be off, mates.&#34; And with&#10;that he pulled his wet cap on to his head.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I accompanied him&#8212;walking a little behind the rest. As he limped&#10;along, he said in an undertone-said kindly&#8212;and as though he were&#10;communicating a secret known only to himself:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Whatsoever one may do, and whithersoever one may turn, one will&#10;find that life cannot be lived without a measure of fraud and&#10;deceit. For that is what life IS, Makarei, the devil fly away with&#10;it!&#8230; I suppose you&#39;re making for the hill? Well, I&#39;ll keep you&#10;company.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Darkness had fallen, but at a certain spot some red and yellow&#10;lamps, lamps the beams of which seemed to be saying, &#34;Come up&#10;hither!&#34; were shining through the obscurity.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Meanwhile, as we proceeded in the direction of the bells that&#10;were ringing on the hill, rivulets of water flowed with a murmur&#10;under our feet, and Ossip&#39;s kindly voice kept mingling with their&#10;sound.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;See,&#34; he continued, &#34;how easily I befooled that sergeant! That&#10;is how things have to be done, Makarei&#8212;one has to keep folk from&#10;knowing one&#39;s business, yet to make them think that they are the&#10;chief persons concerned, and the persons whose wit has put the cap&#10;on the whole.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Yet as I listened to his speech, while supporting his steps, I&#10;could make little of it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Nor did I care to make very much of it, for I was of a simple&#10;and easygoing nature. And though at the moment I could not have&#10;told whether I really liked Ossip, I would still have followed his&#10;lead in any direction&#8212;yes, even across the river again, though the&#10;ice had been giving way beneath me.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And as we proceeded, and the bells echoed and re-echoed, I&#10;thought to myself with a spasm of joy:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ah, many times may I thus walk to greet the spring!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;While Ossip said with a sigh:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The human soul is a winged thing. Even in sleep it flies.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A winged thing? Yes, and a thing of wonder.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 19, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/3920')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('Gubin'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;The place where I first saw him was a tavern wherein, ensconced&#10;in the chimney-corner, and facing a table, he was exclaiming&#10;stutteringly, &#34;Oh, I know the truth about you all! Yes, I know the&#10;truth about you!&#34; while standing in a semicircle in front of him,&#10;and unconsciously rendering him more and more excited with their&#10;sarcastic interpolations, were some tradesmen of the superior&#10;sort&#8212;five in number. One of them remarked indifferently:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;How should you NOT know the truth about us, seeing that you do&#10;nothing but slander us?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Shabby, in fact in rags, Gubin at that moment reminded me of a&#10;homeless dog which, having strayed into a strange street, has found&#10;itself held up by a band of dogs of superior strength, and, seized&#10;with nervousness, is sitting back on its haunches and sweeping the&#10;dust with its tail; and, with growls, and occasional barings of its&#10;fangs, and sundry barkings, attempting now to intimidate its&#10;adversaries, and now to conciliate them. Meanwhile, having&#10;perceived the stranger&#39;s helplessness and insignificance, the&#10;native pack is beginning to moderate its attitude, in the&#10;conviction that, though continued maintenance of dignity is&#10;imperative, it is not worthwhile to pick a quarrel so long as an&#10;occasional yelp be vented in the stranger&#39;s face.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;To whom are you of any use?&#34; one of the tradesmen at length&#10;inquired.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Not a man of us but may be of use.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;To whom, then?&#34;&#8230;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I had long since grown familiar with tavern disputes concerning&#10;verities, and not infrequently seen those disputes develop into&#10;open brawls; but never had I permitted myself to be drawn into&#10;their toils, or to be set wandering amid their tangles like a blind&#10;man negotiating a number of hillocks. Moreover, just before this&#10;encounter with Gubin, I had arrived at a dim surmise that when such&#10;differences were carried to the point of madness and bloodshed.&#10;Really, they constituted an expression of the unmeaning, hopeless,&#10;melancholy life that is lived in the wilder and more remote&#10;districts of Russia&#8212;of the life that is lived on swampy banks of&#10;dingy rivers, and in our smaller and more God-forgotten towns. For&#10;it would seem that in such places men have nothing to look for, nor&#10;any knowledge of how to look for anything; wherefore, they brawl&#10;and shout in vain attempts to dissipate despondency&#8230; .&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I myself was sitting near Gubin, but on the other side of the&#10;table. Yet, this was not because his outbursts and the tradesmen&#39;s&#10;retorts thereto were a pleasure to listen to, since to me both the&#10;one and the other seemed about as futile as beating the air.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;To whom are YOU of use?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;To himself every man can be useful.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But what good can one do oneself?&#34;&#8230;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The windows of the tavern were open, while in the pendent,&#10;undulating cloud of blue smoke that the flames of the lamps&#10;emitted, those lamps looked like so many yellow pitchers floating&#10;amid the waters of a stagnant pond. Out of doors there was brooding&#10;the quiet of an August night, and not a rustle, not a whisper was&#10;there to be heard. Hence, as numbed with melancholy, I gazed at the&#10;inky heavens and limpid stars I thought to myself:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Surely, never were the sky and the stars meant to look down&#10;upon a life like this, a life like this?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Suddenly someone said with the subdued assurance of a person&#10;reading aloud from a written document:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Unless the peasants of Kubarovo keep a watch upon their timber&#10;lands, the sun will fire them tomorrow, and then the Birkins&#39;&#10;forest also will catch alight.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For a moment the dispute died down. Then, as it were cleaving&#10;the silence, a voice said stutteringly:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Who cares about the significance of the word &#39;truth&#39;?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And the words&#8212;heavy, jumbled, and clumsy&#8212;filled me with&#10;despondent reflections. Then again the voices rose&#8212;this time in&#10;louder and more venomous accents, and with their din recalled to&#10;me, by some accident, the foolish lines:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p class=&#34;poem&#34;&#62;The gods did give men water&#60;br /&#62;&#10;To wash in, and to drink;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Yet man has made it but a pool&#60;br /&#62;&#10;In which his woes to sink.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Presently I moved outside and, seating myself on the steps of&#10;the veranda, fell to contemplating the dull, blurred windows of the&#10;Archpriest&#39;s house on the other side of the square, and to watching&#10;how black shadows kept flitting to and fro behind their panes as&#10;the faint, lugubrious notes of a guitar made themselves heard. And&#10;a high-pitched, irritable voice kept repeating at intervals: &#34;Allow&#10;me. Pray, permit me to speak,&#34; and being answered by a voice which&#10;intermittently shot into the silence, as into a bottomless sack,&#10;the words: &#34;No, do you wait a moment, do you wait a moment.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Surrounded by the darkness, the houses looked stunted like&#10;gravestones, with a line of black trees above their roofs that&#10;loomed shadowy and cloud-like. Only in the furthest corner of the&#10;expanse was the light of a solitary street lamp bearing a&#10;resemblance to the disk of a stationary, resplendent dandelion.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Over everything was melancholy. Far from inviting was the&#10;general outlook. So much was this the case that, had, at that&#10;moment, anyone stolen upon me from behind the bushes and dealt me a&#10;sudden blow on the head, I should merely have sunk to earth without&#10;attempting to see who my assailant had been.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Often, in those days, was I in this mood, for it clave to me as&#10;faithfully as a dog&#8212;never did it wholly leave me.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It was for men like THOSE that this fair earth of ours was&#10;bestowed upon us!&#34; I thought to myself.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Suddenly, with a clatter, someone ran out of the door of the&#10;tavern, slid down the steps, fell headlong at their foot, quickly&#10;regained his equilibrium, and disappeared in the darkness after&#10;exclaiming in a threatening voice:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh, I&#39;LL pay you out! I&#39;LL skin you, you damned&#8230; !&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Whereafter two figures that also appeared in the doorway said as&#10;they stood talking to one another:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You heard him threaten to fire the place, did you not?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, I did. But why should he want to fire it?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Because he is a dangerous rascal.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Presently, slinging my wallet upon my back, I pursued my onward&#10;way along a street that was fenced on either side with a tall&#10;palisade. As I proceeded, long grasses kept catching at my feet and&#10;rustling drily. And so warm was the night as to render the payment&#10;of a lodging fee superfluous; and the more so since in the&#10;neighbourhood of the cemetery, where an advanced guard of young&#10;pines had pushed forward to the cemetery wall and littered the&#10;sandy ground, with a carpet of red, dry cones, there were&#10;sleeping-places prepared in advance.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Suddenly from the darkness there emerged, to recoil again, a&#10;man&#39;s tall figure.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Who is that? Who is it?&#34; asked the hoarse, nervous voice of&#10;Gubin in dissipation of the deathlike stillness.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Which said, he and I fell into step with one another. As we&#10;proceeded he inquired whence I had come, and why I was still&#10;abroad. Whereafter he extended to me, as to an old acquaintance,&#10;the invitation:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Will you come and sleep at my place? My house is near here, and&#10;as for work, I will find you a job tomorrow. In fact, as it&#10;happens, I am needing a man to help me clean out a well at the&#10;Birkins&#39; place. Will the job suit you? Very well, then. Always I&#10;like to settle things overnight, as it is at night that I can best&#10;see through people.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The &#34;house&#34; turned out to be nothing more than an old one-eyed,&#10;hunchbacked washhouse or shanty which, bulging of wall, stood&#10;wedged against the clayey slope of a ravine as though it would fain&#10;bury itself amid the boughs of the neighbouring arbutus trees and&#10;elders.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Without striking a light, Gubin flung himself upon some mouldy&#10;hay that littered a threshold as narrow as the threshold of a&#10;dog-kennel, and said to me with an air of authority as he did&#10;so:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I will sleep with my head towards the door, for the atmosphere&#10;here is a trifle confined.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And, true enough, the place reeked of elderberries, soap, burnt&#10;stuff, and decayed leaves. I could not conceive why I had come to&#10;such a spot.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The twisted branches of the neighbouring trees hung motionless&#10;athwart the sky, and concealed from view the golden dust of the&#10;Milky Way, while across the Oka an owl kept screeching, and the&#10;strange, arresting remarks of my companion pelted me like showers&#10;of peas.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Do not be surprised that I should live in a remote ravine,&#34; he&#10;said. &#34;I, whose hand is against every man, can at least feel lord&#10;of what I survey here.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Too dark was it for me to see my host&#39;s face, but my memory&#10;recalled his bald cranium, and the yellow light of the lamps&#10;falling upon a nose as long as a woodpecker&#39;s beak, a pair of grey&#10;and stubbly cheeks, a pair of thin lips covered by a bristling&#10;moustache, a mouth sharp-cut as with a knife, and full of black,&#10;evil-looking stumps, a pair of pointed, sensitive, mouse-like ears,&#10;and a clean-shaven chin. The last feature in no way consorted with&#10;his visage, or with his whole appearance; but at least it rendered&#10;him worthy of remark, and enabled one to realise that one had to&#10;deal with neither a peasant nor a soldier nor a tradesman, but with&#10;a man peculiar to himself. Also, his frame was lanky, with long&#10;arms and legs, and pointed knees and elbows. In fact, so like a&#10;piece of string was his body that to twist it round and round, or&#10;even to tie it into a knot, would, seemingly, have been easy&#10;enough.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For awhile I found his speech difficult to follow; wherefore,&#10;silently I gazed at the sky, where the stars appeared to be playing&#10;at follow-my-leader.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Are you asleep?&#34; at length he inquired.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No, I am not. Why do you shave your beard?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why do you ask?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Because, if you will pardon me, I think your face would look&#10;better bearded.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With a short laugh he exclaimed:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Bearded? Ah, sloven! Bearded, indeed!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;To which he added more gravely:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Both Peter the Great and Nicholas I were wiser than you, for&#10;they ordained that whosoever should be bearded should have his nose&#10;slit, and be fined a hundred roubles. Did you ever hear of&#10;that?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And from the same source, from the beard, arose also the Great&#10;Schism.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;His manner of speaking was too rapid to be articulate, and, in&#10;leaving his mouth, his words caused his lips to bare stumps and&#10;gums amid which they lost their way, became disintegrated, and&#10;issued, as it were, in an incomplete state.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Everyone,&#34; he continued, &#34;knows that life is lived more easily&#10;with a beard than without one, since with a beard lies are more&#10;easily told&#8212;they can be told, and then hidden in the masses of&#10;hair. Hence we ought to go through life with our faces naked, since&#10;such faces render untruthfulness more difficult, and prevent their&#10;owners from prevaricating without the fact becoming plain to&#10;all.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But what about women?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What about women? Well, women can always lie to their husbands&#10;successfully, but not to all the town, to all the world, to folk in&#10;general. Moreover, since a woman&#39;s real business in life is the&#10;same as that of the hen, to rear young, what can it matter if she&#10;DOES cackle a few falsehoods, provided that she be neither a priest&#10;nor a mayor nor a tchinovnik, and does not possess any authority,&#10;and cannot establish laws? For the really important point is that&#10;the law itself should not lie, but ever uphold truth pure and&#10;simple. Long has the prevalent illegality disgusted me.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The door of the shanty was standing open, and amid the outer&#10;darkness, as in a church, the trees looked like pillars, and the&#10;white stems of the birches like silver candelabra tipped with a&#10;thousand lights, or dimly-seen choristers with faces showing pale&#10;above sacramental vestments of black. All my soul was full of a&#10;sort of painful restlessness. It was a feeling as though I should&#10;live to rise and go forth into the darkness, and offer battle to&#10;the terrors of the night; yet ever, as my companion&#39;s torrential&#10;speech caught and held my attention, it detained me where I&#10;was.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My father was a man of no little originality and character,&#34; he&#10;went on. &#34;Wherefore, none of the townsfolk liked him. By the age of&#10;twenty he had risen to be an alderman, yet never to the end could&#10;get the better of folk&#39;s stubbornness and stupidity, even though he&#10;made it his custom to treat all and sundry to food and drink, and&#10;to reason with them. No, not even at the last did he attain his&#10;due. People feared him because he revolutionised everything,&#10;revolutionised it down to the very roots; the truth being that he&#10;had grasped the one essential fact that law and order must be&#10;driven, like nails, into the people&#39;s very vitals.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mice squeaked under the floor, and on the further side of the&#10;Oka an owl screeched, while amid the pitch-black heavens I could&#10;see a number of blotches intermittently lightening to an elusive&#10;red and blurring the faint glitter of the stars.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It was one o&#39;clock in the morning when my father died,&#34; Gubin&#10;continued. &#34;And upon myself, who was seventeen and had just&#10;finished my course at the municipal school of Riazan, there&#10;devolved, naturally enough, all the enmity that my father had&#10;incurred during his lifetime. &#39;He is just like his sire,&#39; folk&#10;said. Also, I was alone, absolutely alone, in the world, since my&#10;mother had lost her reason two years before my father&#39;s death, and&#10;passed away in a frenzy. However, I had an uncle, a retired&#10;unter-officier who was both a sluggard, a tippler, and a hero (a&#10;hero because he had had his eyes shot out at Plevna, and his left&#10;arm injured in a manner which had induced paralysis, and his breast&#10;adorned with the military cross and a set of medals). And&#10;sometimes, this uncle of mine would rally me on my learning. For&#10;instance, &#39;Scholar,&#39; he would say, &#39;what does &#34;tiversia&#34; mean?&#39; &#39;No&#10;such word exists,&#39; would be my reply, and thereupon he would seize&#10;me by the hair, for he was rather an awkward person to deal with.&#10;Another factor as concerned making me ashamed of my scholarship was&#10;the ignorance of the townspeople in general, and in the end I&#10;became the common butt, a sort of &#39;holy idiot.&#39;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So greatly did these recollections move Gubin that he rose and&#10;transferred his position to the door of the hut, where, a dark blur&#10;against the square of blue, he lit a gurgling pipe, and puffed&#10;thereat until his long, conical nose glowed. Presently the surging&#10;stream of words began again:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;At twenty I married an orphan, and when she fell ill and died&#10;childless I found myself alone once more, and without an adviser or&#10;a friend. However, still I continued both to live and to look about&#10;me. And in time, I perceived that life is not lived wholly as it&#10;should be.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What in life is &#39;not lived wholly as it should be&#39;?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Everything in life. For life is mere folly, mere fatuous&#10;nonsense. The truth is that our dogs do not bark always at the&#10;right moment. For instance, when I said to folk, &#39;How would it be&#10;if we were to open a technical school for girls?&#39; They merely&#10;laughed and replied, &#39;Trade workers are hopeless drunkards. Already&#10;have we enough of them. Besides, hitherto women have contrived to&#10;get on WITHOUT education.&#39; And when next I conceived a scheme for&#10;instituting a match factory, it befell that the factory was burnt&#10;down during its first year of existence, and I found myself once&#10;more at a loose end. Next a certain woman got hold of me, and I&#10;flitted about her like a martin around a belfry, and so lost my&#10;head as to live life as though I were not on earth at all&#8212;for three&#10;years I did not know even what I was doing, and only when I&#10;recovered my senses did I perceive myself to be a pauper, and my&#10;all, every single thing that I had possessed, to have passed into&#10;HER white hands. Yes, at twenty-eight I found myself a beggar. Yet&#10;I have never wholly regretted the fact, for certainly for a time I&#10;lived life as few men ever live it. &#39;Take my all&#8212;take it!&#39; I used&#10;to say to her. And, truly enough, I should never have done much&#10;good with my father&#39;s fortune, whereas she&#8212;well, so it befell.&#10;Somehow I think that in those days my opinions must have been&#10;different from now&#8212;now that I have lost everything&#8230; . Yet the woman&#10;used to say, &#39;You have NOT lost everything,&#39; and she had wit enough&#10;to fit out a whole townful of people.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;This woman&#8212;who was she?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The wife of a merchant. Whenever she unrobed and said, &#39;Come!&#10;What is this body of mine worth?&#39; I used to make reply, &#39;A price&#10;that is beyond compute.&#39;&#8230; So within three years everything that I&#10;possessed vanished like smoke. Sometimes, of course, folk laughed&#10;at and jibed at me; nor did I ever refute them. But now that I have&#10;come to have a better understanding of life&#39;s affairs, I see that&#10;life is not wholly lived as it should be. For that matter, too, I&#10;do not hold my tongue on the subject, for that is not my way&#8212;still&#10;left to me I have a tongue and my soul. The same reason accounts&#10;for the fact that no one likes me, and that by everyone I am looked&#10;upon as a fool.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;How, in your opinion, ought life to be lived?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Without answering me at once, Gubin sucked at his pipe until his&#10;nose made a glowing red blur in the darkness. Then he muttered&#10;slowly:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;How life ought to be lived no one could say exactly. And this&#10;though I have given much thought to the subject, and still am doing&#10;so.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I found it no difficult matter to form a mental picture of the&#10;desolate existence which this man must be leading&#8212;this man whom all&#10;his fellows both derided and shunned. For at that time I too was&#10;bidding fair to fail in life, and had my heart in the grip of&#10;ceaseless despondency.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The truth is that of futile people Russia is over-full. Many&#10;such I myself have known, and always they have attracted me as&#10;strongly and mysteriously as a magnet. Always they have struck me&#10;more favourably than the provincial-minded majority who live for&#10;food and work alone, and put away from them all that could&#10;conceivably render their bread-winning difficult, or prevent them&#10;from snatching bread out of the hands of their weaker neighbours.&#10;For most such folk are gloomy and self-contained, with hearts that&#10;have turned to wood, and an outlook that ever reverts to the past;&#10;unless, indeed, they be folk of spurious good nature, an addition&#10;to talkativeness, and an apparent bonhomie which veils a frigid,&#10;grey interior, and conveys an impression of cruelty and greed of&#10;all that life contains.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Always, in the end, I have detected in such folk something&#10;wintry, something that makes them seem, as it were, to be spending&#10;spring and summer in expectation solely of the winter season, with&#10;its long nights, and its cold of an austerity which forces one for&#10;ever to be consuming food.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Yet seldom among this distasteful and wearisome crowd of wintry&#10;folk is there to be encountered a man who has altogether proved a&#10;failure. But if he has done so, he will be found to be a man whose&#10;nature is of a more thoughtful, a more truly existent, a more&#10;clear-sighted cast than that of his fellows&#8212;a man who at least can&#10;look beyond the boundaries of the trite and commonplace, and whose&#10;mentality has a greater capacity for attaining spiritual&#10;fulfilment, and is more desirous of doing so, than the mentality of&#10;his compeers. That is to say, in such a man one can always detect a&#10;striving for space, as a man who, loving light, carries light in&#10;himself.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Unfortunately, all too often is that light only the fugitive&#10;phosphorescence of putrefaction; wherefore as one contemplates him&#10;one soon begins to realise with bitterness and vexation and&#10;disappointment that he is but a sluggard, but a braggart, but one&#10;who is petty and weak and blinded with conceit and distorted with&#10;envy, but one between whose word and whose deed there gapes a&#10;disparity even wider and deeper than the disparity which divides&#10;the word from the deed of the man of winter, of the man who, though&#10;he be as tardy as a snail, at least is making some way in the&#10;world, in contradistinction from the failure who revolves ever in a&#10;single spot, like some barren old maid before the reflection in her&#10;looking-glass.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Hence, as I listened to Gubin, there recurred to me more than&#10;one instance of his type.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, I have succeeded in observing life throughout,&#34; he&#10;muttered drowsily as his head sank slowly upon his breast.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And sleep overtook myself with similar suddenness. Apparently&#10;that slumber was of a few minutes&#39; duration only, yet what aroused&#10;me was Gubin pulling at my leg.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Get up now,&#34; he said. &#34;It is time that we were off.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And as his bluish-grey eyes peered into my face, somehow I&#10;derived from their mournful expression a sense of intellectuality.&#10;Beneath the hair on his hollow cheeks were reddish veins, while&#10;similar veins, bluish in tint, covered with a network his temples,&#10;and his bare arms had the appearance of being made of tanned&#10;leather.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Dawn had not yet broken when we rose and proceeded through the&#10;slumbering streets beneath a sky that was of a dull yellow, and&#10;amid an atmosphere that was full of the smell of burning.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Five days now has the forest been on fire,&#34; observed Gubin.&#10;&#34;Yet the fools cannot succeed in putting it out.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Presently the establishment of the merchants Birkin lay before&#10;us, an establishment of curious aspect, since it constituted,&#10;rather, a conglomeration of appendages to a main building of ground&#10;floor and attics, with four windows facing on to the street, and a&#10;series of underpropping annexes. That series extended to the wing,&#10;and was solid and permanent, and bade fair to overflow into the&#10;courtyard, and through the entrance-gates, and across the street,&#10;and to the very kitchen-garden and flower-garden themselves. Also,&#10;it seemed to have been stolen piecemeal from somewhere, and at&#10;different periods, and from different localities, and tacked at&#10;haphazard on to the walls of the parent erection. Moreover, all the&#10;windows of the latter were small, and in their green panes, as they&#10;confronted the world, there was a timid and suspicious air, while,&#10;in particular, the three windows which faced upon the courtyard had&#10;iron bars to them. Lastly, there were posted, sentinel-like on the&#10;entrance-steps, two water-butts as a precaution against fire.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What think you of the place?&#34; Gubin muttered as he peered into&#10;the well. &#34;Isn&#39;t it a barbarous hole? The right thing would be to&#10;pull it down wholesale, and then rebuild it on larger and less&#10;restricted lines. Yet these fools merely go tacking new additions&#10;on to the old.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For awhile his lips moved as in an incantation. Then he frowned,&#10;glanced shrewdly at the structures in question, and continued&#10;softly:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I may say in passing that the place is MINE.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;YOURS?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, mine. At all events, so it used to be.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And he pulled a grimace as though he had got the toothache&#10;before adding with an air of command:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Come! I will pump out the water, and YOU shall carry it to the&#10;entrance-steps and fill the water-butts. Here is a pail, and here a&#10;ladder.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Whereafter, with a considerable display of strength, he set&#10;about his portion of the task, whilst I myself took pail in hand&#10;and advanced towards the steps to find that the water-butts were so&#10;rotten that, instead of retaining the water, they let it leak out&#10;into the courtyard. Gubin said with an oath:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Fine masters these&#8212;masters who grudge one a groat, and squander&#10;a rouble! What if a fire WERE to break out? Oh, the&#10;blockheads!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Presently, the proprietors in person issued into the&#10;courtyard&#8212;the stout, bald Peter Birkin, a man whose face was&#10;flushed even to the whites of his shifty eyes, and, close behind&#10;him, eke his shadow, Jonah Birkin&#8212;a person of sandy, sullen mien,&#10;and overhanging brows, and dull, heavy eyes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Good day, dear sir,&#34; said Peter Birkin thinly, as with a puffy&#10;hand he raised from his head a cloth cap, while Jonah nodded. And&#10;then, with a sidelong glance at myself, asked in a deep bass&#10;voice:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Who is this young man?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Large and important like peacocks, the pair then shuffled across&#10;the wet yard, and in so doing, went to much trouble to avoid&#10;soiling their polished shoes. Next Peter said to his brother:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Have you noticed that the water-butts are rotted? Oh, that fine&#10;Yakinika! He ought long ago to have been dismissed.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Who is that young man over there?&#34; Jonah repeated with an air&#10;of asperity.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The son of his father and mother,&#34; Gubin replied quietly, and&#10;without so much as a glance at the brothers.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well, come along,&#34; snuffled Peter with a drawling of his&#10;vowels. &#34;It is high time that we were moving. It doesn&#39;t matter who&#10;the young man may be.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And with that they slip-slopped across to the entrance gates,&#10;while Gubin gazed after them with knitted brows, and as the&#10;brothers were disappearing through the wicket said carelessly:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The old sheep! They live solely by the wits of their&#10;stepmother, and if it were not for her, they would long ago have&#10;come to grief. Yes, she is a woman beyond words clever. Once upon a&#10;time there were three brothers&#8212;Peter, Alexis, and Jonah; but,&#10;unfortunately, Alexis got killed in a brawl. A fine, tall fellow HE&#10;was, whereas these two are a pair of gluttons, like everyone else&#10;in this town. Not for nothing do three loaves figure on the&#10;municipal arms! Now, to work again! Or shall we take a rest?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Here there stepped on to the veranda a tall, well-grown young&#10;woman in an open pink bodice and a blue skirt who, shading blue&#10;eyes with her hand, scanned the courtyard and the steps, and said&#10;with some diffidence:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Good day, Yakov Vasilitch.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With a good-humoured glance in response, and his mouth open,&#10;Gubin waved a hand in greeting:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Good day to YOU, Nadezhda Ivanovna,&#34; he replied. &#34;How are you&#10;this morning?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Somehow this made her blush, and cross her arms upon her ample&#10;bosom, while her kindly, rounded, eminently Russian face evinced&#10;the ghost of a shy smile. At the same time, it was a face wherein&#10;not a single feature was of a kind to remain fixed in the memory, a&#10;face as vacant as though nature had forgotten to stamp thereon a&#10;single wish. Hence, even when the woman smiled there seemed to&#10;remain a doubt whether the smile had really materialised.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;How is Natalia Vasilievna?&#34; continued Gubin.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Much as usual,&#34; the woman answered softly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Whereafter hesitantly, and with downcast eyes, she essayed to&#10;cross the courtyard. As she passed me I caught a whiff of&#10;raspberries and currants.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Disappearing into the grey mist through a small door with iron&#10;staples, she soon reissued thence with a hencoop, and, seating&#10;herself on the steps of the doorway, and setting the coop on her&#10;knees, took between her two large palms some fluttering, chirping,&#10;downy, golden chicks, and raised them to her ruddy lips and cheeks&#10;with a murmur of:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh my little darlings! Oh my little darlings!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And in her voice, somehow, there was a note as of intoxication,&#10;of abandonment. Meanwhile dull, reddish sunbeams were beginning to&#10;peer through the fence, and to warm the long, pointed staples with&#10;which it was fastened together. While in a stream of water that was&#10;dripping from the eaves, and trickling over the floor of the court,&#10;and around the woman&#39;s feet, a single beam was bathing and&#10;quivering as though it would fain effect an advance to the woman&#39;s&#10;lap and the hencoop, and, with the soft, downy chicks, enjoy the&#10;caresses of the woman&#39;s bare white arms.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ah, little things!&#34; again she murmured. &#34;Ah, little children of&#10;mine!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Upon that Gubin suddenly desisted from his task of hauling up&#10;the bucket, and, as he steadied the rope with his arms raised above&#10;his head, said quickly:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Nadezhda Ivanovna, you ought indeed to have had some&#10;children&#8212;six at the least!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Yet no reply came, nor did the woman even look at him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The rays of the sun were now spreading, smokelike and&#10;greyish-yellow, over the silver river. Above the river&#39;s calm bed a&#10;muslin texture of mist was coiling. Against the nebulous heavens&#10;the blue of the forest was rearing itself amid the fragrant,&#10;pungent fumes from the burning timber.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Yet still asleep amid its sheltering half-circle of forest was&#10;the quiet little town of Miamlin, while behind it, and encompassing&#10;it as with a pair of dark wings, the forest in question looked as&#10;though it were ruffling its feathers in preparation for further&#10;flight beyond the point where, the peaceful Oka reached, the trees&#10;stood darkening, overshadowing the water&#39;s clear depths, and&#10;looking at themselves therein.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Yet, though the hour was so early, everything seemed to have&#10;about it an air of sadness, a mien as though the day lacked&#10;promise, as though its face were veiled and mournful, as though,&#10;not yet come to birth, it nevertheless were feeling weary in&#10;advance.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Seating myself by Gubin on some trampled straw in the hut&#10;ordinarily used by the watchman of the Birkins&#39; extensive orchard,&#10;I found that, owing to the orchard being set on a hillside, I could&#10;see over the tops of the apple and pear and fig trees, where their&#10;tops hung bespangled with dew as with quicksilver, and view the&#10;whole town and its multicoloured churches, yellow, newly-painted&#10;prison, and yellow-painted bank.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And while in the town&#39;s lurid, four-square buildings I could&#10;trace a certain resemblance to the aces of clubs stamped upon&#10;convicts&#39; backs, in the grey strips of the streets I could trace a&#10;certain resemblance to a number of rents in an old, ragged, faded,&#10;dusty coat. Indeed, that morning all comparisons seemed to take on&#10;a tinge of melancholy; the reason being that throughout the&#10;previous evening there had been moaning in my soul a mournful dirge&#10;on the future life.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With nothing, however, were the churches of the town of which I&#10;am speaking exactly comparable, for many of them had attained a&#10;degree of beauty the contemplation of which caused the town to&#10;assume throughout&#8212;a different, a more pleasing and seductive,&#10;aspect. Thought I to myself: &#34;Would that men had fashioned all&#10;other buildings in the town as the churches have been&#10;fashioned!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;One of the latter, an old, squat edifice the blank windows of&#10;which were deeply sunken in the stuccoed walls, was known as the&#10;&#34;Prince&#39;s Church,&#34; for the reason that it enshrined the remains of&#10;a local Prince and his wife, persons of whom it stood recorded that&#10;&#34;they did pass all their lives in kindly, unchanging love.&#34;&#8230;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The following night Gubin and I chanced to see Peter Birkin&#39;s&#10;tall, pale, timid young wife traverse the garden on her way to a&#10;tryst in the washhouse with her lover, the precentor of the&#10;Prince&#39;s Church. And as clad in a simple gown, and barefooted, and&#10;having her ample shoulders swathed in an old, gold jacket or shawl&#10;of some sort, she crossed the orchard by a path running between two&#10;lines of apple trees; she walked with the unhasting gait of a cat&#10;which is crossing a yard after a shower of rain, and from time to&#10;time, whenever a puddle is encountered, lifts and shakes&#10;fastidiously one of its soft paws. Probably, in the woman&#39;s case,&#10;this came of the fact that things kept pricking and tickling her&#10;soles as she proceeded. Also, her knees, I could see, were&#10;trembling, and her step had in it a certain hesitancy, a certain&#10;lack of assurance.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Meanwhile, bending over the garden from the warm night sky, the&#10;moon&#39;s kindly visage, though on the wane, was shining brightly; and&#10;when the woman emerged from the shadow of the trees I could discern&#10;the dark patches of her eyes, her rounded, half-parted lips, and&#10;the thick plait of hair which lay across her bosom. Also, in the&#10;moonlight her bodice had assumed a bluish tinge, so that she looked&#10;almost phantasmal; and when soundlessly, moving as though on air,&#10;she stepped back into the shadow of the trees, that shadow seemed&#10;to lighten.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;All this happened at midnight, or thereabouts, but neither of us&#10;was yet asleep, owing to the fact that Gubin had been telling me&#10;some interesting stories concerning the town and its families and&#10;inhabitants. However, as soon as he descried the woman looming like&#10;a ghost, he leapt to his feet in comical terror, then subsided on&#10;to the straw again, contracted his body as though he were in&#10;convulsions, and hurriedly made the sign of the cross.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh Jesus our Lord!&#34; he gasped. &#34;Tell me what that is, tell me&#10;what that is!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Keep quiet, you,&#34; I urged.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Instead, lurching in my direction, he nudged me with his&#10;arm,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Is it Nadezhda, think you?&#34; he whispered.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It is.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Phew! The scene seems like a dream. Just in the same way, and&#10;in the very same place, did her mother-in-law, Petrushka&#39;s&#10;stepmother, use to come and walk. Yes, it was just like this.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then, rolling over, face downwards, he broke into subdued,&#10;malicious chuckles; whereafter, seizing my hand and sawing it up&#10;and down, he whispered amid his exultant pants:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I expect Petrushka is asleep, for probably he has taken too&#10;much liquor at the Bassanov&#39;s smotrini. [A festival at which a&#10;fiance pays his first visit to the house of the parents of his&#10;betrothed.] Aye, he will be asleep. And as for Jonah, HE will have&#10;gone to Vaska Klochi. So tonight, until morning, Nadezhda will be&#10;able to kick up her heels to her heart&#39;s content.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I too had begun to surmise that the woman was come thither for&#10;purposes of her own. Yet the scene was almost dreamlike in its&#10;beauty. It thrilled me to the soul to watch how the woman&#39;s blue&#10;eyes gazed about her&#8212;gazed as though she were ardently, caressingly&#10;whispering to all living creatures, asleep or awake:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh my darlings! Oh my darlings!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Beside me the uncouth, broken-down Gubin went on in hoarse&#10;accents:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You must know that she is Petrushka&#39;s THIRD wife, a woman whom&#10;he took to himself from the family of a merchant of Murom. Yet the&#10;town has it that not only Petrushka, but also Jonah, makes use of&#10;her&#8212;that she acts as wife to both brothers, and therefore lacks&#10;children. Also has it been said of her that one Trinity Sunday she&#10;was seen by a party of women to misconduct herself in this garden&#10;with a police sergeant, and then to sit on his lap and weep. Yet&#10;this last I do not wholly believe, for the sergeant in question is&#10;a veteran scarcely able to put one foot before the other. Also,&#10;Jonah, though a brute, lives in abject fear of his stepmother.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Here a worm-eaten apple fell to the ground, and the woman&#10;paused; whereafter, with head a little raised, she resumed her way&#10;with greater speed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As for Gubin, he continued, unchecked, though with a trifle less&#10;animosity, rather as though he were reading aloud a manuscript&#10;which he found wearisome:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;See how a man like Peter Birkin may pride himself upon his&#10;wealth, and receive honour during his lifetime, yet all the while&#10;have the devil grinning over his shoulder!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then he, Gubin, kept silent awhile, and merely breathed heavily,&#10;and twisted his body about. But suddenly, he resumed in a strange&#10;whisper:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Fifteen years ago&#8212;no, surely it was longer ago than&#10;that?&#8212;Madame Nadkin, Nadezhda&#39;s mother-in-law, made it her practice&#10;to come to this spot to meet her lover. And a fine gallant HE&#10;was!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Somehow, as I watched the woman creeping along, and looking as&#10;though she were intending to commit a theft, or as though she&#10;fancied that at any moment she might see the plump brothers Birkin&#10;issue from the courtyard into the garden and come shuffling&#10;ponderously over the darkened ground, with ropes and cudgels&#10;grasped in coarse, red hands which knew no pity; somehow, as I&#10;watched her, I felt saddened, and paid little heed to Gubin&#39;s&#10;whispered remarks, so intently were my eyes fixed upon the granary&#10;wall as, after gliding along it awhile, the woman bent her head and&#10;disappeared through the dark blue of the washhouse door. As for&#10;Gubin, he went to sleep with a last drowsy remark of:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Life is all falsity. Husbands, wives, fathers, children&#8212;all of&#10;them practise deceit.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In the east, portions of the sky were turning to light purple,&#10;and other portions to a darker hue, while from time to time I could&#10;see, looming black against those portions, coils of smoke the&#10;density of which kept being stabbed with fiery spikes of flame, so&#10;that the vague, towering forest looked like a hill on the top of&#10;which a fiery dragon was crawling about, and writhing, and&#10;intermittently raising tremulous, scarlet wings, and as often&#10;relapsing into, becoming submerged in, the bank of vapour. And, in&#10;contemplating the spectacle, I seemed actually to be able to hear&#10;the cruel, hissing din of combat between red and black, and to see&#10;pale, frightened rabbits scudding from underneath the roots of&#10;trees amid showers of sparks, and panting, half-suffocated birds&#10;fluttering wildly amid the branches as further and further afield,&#10;and more and more triumphantly, the scarlet dragon unfurled its&#10;wings, and consumed the darkness, and devoured the rain-soaked&#10;timber.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Presently from the dark, blurred doorway in the wall of the&#10;washhouse there emerged a dark figure which went flitting away&#10;among the trees, while after it someone called in a sharp, incisive&#10;whisper:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Do not forget. You MUST come.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh, I shall be only too glad!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Very well. In the morning the lame woman shall call upon you.&#10;Do you hear?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And as the woman disappeared from view the other person&#10;sauntered across the garden, and scaled the fence with a&#10;clatter.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;That night I could not sleep, but, until dawn, lay watching the&#10;burning forest as gradually the weary moon declined, and the lamp&#10;of Venus, cold and green as an emerald, came into view over the&#10;crosses on the Prince&#39;s Church. Indeed was the latter a fitting&#10;place for Venus to illumine if really it had been the case that the&#10;Prince and Princess had &#34;passed their lives in kindly, unchanging&#10;love&#34;!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Gradually, the dew cleared the trees of the night darkness, and&#10;caused the damp, grey foliage to smile once more with aniseed and&#10;red raspberry, and to sparkle with the gold of their mildew. Also,&#10;there came hovering about us goldfinches with their little&#10;red-hooded crests, and fussy tomtits in their cravats of yellow,&#10;while a nimble, dark, blue woodpecker scaled the stem of an apple&#10;tree. And everywhere, yellow leaves fluttered to earth, and, in&#10;doing so, so closely resembled birds as to make it not always easy&#10;to distinguish whether a leaf or a tomtit had glimmered for a&#10;moment in the air.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Gubin awoke, sighed, and with his gnarled knuckles gave his&#10;puffy eyes a rub. Then he raised himself upon all-fours, and,&#10;crawling, much dishevelled with sleep, out of the watchman&#39;s hut,&#10;snuffed the air (a process in which his movements approximated&#10;comically to those of a keen-nosed watch-dog). Finally he rose to&#10;his feet, and, in the act, shook one of the trees so violently as&#10;to cause a bough to shed its burden of ripe fruit, and disperse the&#10;apples hither and thither over the dry surface of the ground, or&#10;cause them to bury themselves among the long grass. Three of the&#10;juiciest apples he duly recovered, and, after examination of their&#10;exterior, probed with his teeth, while kicking away from him as&#10;many of the remainder as he could descry.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why spoil those apples?&#34; I queried&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh, so you are NOT asleep?&#34; he countered with a nod of his&#10;melon-shaped cranium. &#34;As a matter of fact, a few apples won&#39;t be&#10;missed, for there are too many of them about. My own father it was&#10;that planted the trees which have grown them.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then, turning upon me a keen, good-humoured eye, and chuckling,&#10;he added:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What about that Nadezhda? Ah, she is a clever woman indeed! Yet&#10;I have a surprise in store for her and her lover.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why should you have?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Because I desire to benefit mankind at large&#34; (this was said&#10;didactically, and with a frown). &#34;For, no matter where I detect&#10;evil or underhandedness, it is my duty&#8212;I feel it to be my duty&#8212;to&#10;expose that evil, and to lay it bare. There exist people who need&#10;to be taught a lesson, and to whom I long to cry: &#39;Sinners that you&#10;are, do you lead more righteous lives!&#39;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;From behind some clouds the sun was rising with a disk as murky&#10;and mournful as the face of an ailing child. It was as though he&#10;were feeling conscious that he had done amiss in so long delaying&#10;to shed light upon the world, in so long dallying on his bed of&#10;soft clouds amid the smoke of the forest fire. But gradually the&#10;cheering beams suffused the garden throughout, and evoked from the&#10;ripening fruit an intoxicating wave of scent in which there could&#10;be distinguished also the bracing breath of autumn.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Simultaneously there rose into the sky, in the wake of the sun,&#10;a dense stratum of cloud which, blue and snow-white in colour, lay&#10;with its soft hummocks reflected in the calm Oka, and so wrought&#10;therein a secondary firmament as profound and impalpable as its&#10;original.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Now then, Makar!&#34; was Gubin&#39;s command, and once more I posted&#10;myself at the bottom of the well. About three sazheni in depth, and&#10;lined with cold, damp mud to above the level of my middle, the&#10;orifice was charged with a stifling odour both of rotten wood and&#10;of something more intolerable still. Also, whenever I had filled&#10;the pail with mud, and then emptied it into the bucket and shouted&#10;&#34;Right away!&#34; the bucket would start swinging against my person and&#10;bumping it, as unwillingly it went aloft, and thereafter discharge&#10;upon my head and shoulders clots of filth and drippings of&#10;water&#8212;meanwhile screening, with its circular bottom, the glowing&#10;sun and now scarce visible stars. In passing, the spectacle of&#10;those stars&#39; waning both pained and cheered me, for it meant that&#10;for a companion in the firmament they now had the sun. Hence it was&#10;until my neck felt almost fractured, and my spine and the nape of&#10;my neck were aching as though clamped in a cast of plaster of&#10;paris, that I kept my eyes turned aloft. Yes, anything to gain a&#10;sight of the stars! From them I could not remove my vision, for&#10;they seemed to exhibit the heavens in a new guise, and to convey to&#10;me the joyful tidings that in the sky there was present also the&#10;sun.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Yet though, meanwhile, I tried to ponder on something great, I&#10;never failed to find myself cherishing the absurd, obstinate&#10;apprehension that soon the Birkins would leave their beds, enter&#10;the courtyard, and have Nadezhda betrayed to them by Gubin.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And throughout there kept descending to me from above the&#10;latter&#39;s inarticulate, as it were damp-sodden, observations.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Another rat!&#34; I heard him exclaim. &#34;To think that those two&#10;fellows, men of money, should neglect for two whole years to clean&#10;out their well! Why, what can the brutes have been drinking&#10;meanwhile? Look out below, you!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And once more, with a creaking of the pulley, the bucket would&#10;descend&#8212;bumping and thudding against the lining of the well as it&#10;did so, and bespattering afresh my head and shoulders with its&#10;filth. Rightly speaking, the Birkins ought to have cleared out the&#10;well themselves!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Let us exchange places,&#34; I cried at length.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What is wrong?&#34; inquired Gubin in response&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Down here it is cold&#8212;I can&#39;t stand it any longer.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Gee up!&#34; exclaimed Gubin to the old horse which supplied the&#10;leverage power for the bucket; whereupon I seated myself upon the&#10;edge of the receptacle and went aloft, where everything was looking&#10;so bright and warm as to bear a new and unwontedly pleasing&#10;appearance.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So now it was Gubin&#39;s turn to stand at the bottom of the well.&#10;And soon, in addition to the odour of decay, and a subdued sound of&#10;splashing, and the rumblings and bumpings of the iron bucket&#10;against its chain, there began to come up from the damp, black&#10;cavity a perfect stream of curses.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The infernal skinflints!&#34; I heard my companion exclaim.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Hullo, here is something! A dog or a baby, eh? The damned old&#10;barbarians!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And the bucket ascended with, among its contents, a sodden and&#10;most ancient hat. With the passage of time Gubin&#39;s temper grew&#10;worse and worse.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;If I SHOULD find a baby here,&#34; next he exclaimed, &#34;I shall&#10;report the matter to the police, and get those blessed old brothers&#10;into trouble.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Each movement of the leathern-hided, wall-eyed steed which did&#10;our bidding was accompanied by a swishing of a sandy tail which had&#10;for its object the brushing away of autumn&#39;s harbingers, the&#10;bluebottles. Almost with the tranquil gait of a religious did the&#10;animal accomplish its periodical journeys from the wall to the&#10;entrance gates and back again; after which it always heaved a&#10;profound sigh, and stood with its bony crest lowered.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Presently, from a corner of the yard that lay screened behind&#10;some rank, pale, withered, trampled herbage a door screeched. Into&#10;the yard there issued Nadezhda Birkin, carrying a bunch of keys,&#10;and followed by a lady who, elderly and rotund of figure, had a few&#10;dark hairs growing on her full and rather haughty upper lip. As the&#10;two walked towards the cellar (Nadezhda being clad only in an&#10;under-petticoat, with a chemise half-covering her shoulders, and&#10;slippers thrust on to bare feet), I perceived from the languor of&#10;the younger woman&#39;s gait that she was feeling weary indeed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why do you look at us like that?&#34; her senior inquired of me as&#10;she drew level. And as she did so the eyes that peered at me from&#10;above the full and, somehow, displaced-looking cheeks bid in them a&#10;dim, misty, half-blind expression.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That must be Peter Birkin&#39;s mother-in-law,&#34; was my unspoken&#10;reflection.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At the door of the cellar Nadezhda handed the keys to her&#10;companion, and with a slow step which set her ample bosom swaying,&#10;and increased the disarray of the bodice on her round, but broad,&#10;shoulders, approached myself, and said quietly:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Please open the gutter-sluice and let out the water into the&#10;street, or the yard will soon be flooded. Oh, the smell of it! What&#10;is that thing there? A rat? Oh batinshka, what a horrible&#10;mess!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Her face had about it a drawn look, and under her eyes there&#10;were a pair of dark patches, and in their depths the dry glitter of&#10;a person who has spent a night of waking. True, it was a face still&#10;fresh of hue; yet beads of sweat were standing on the forehead, and&#10;her shoulders looked grey and heavy&#8212;as grey and heavy as unleavened&#10;bread which the fire has coated with a thin crust, yet failed to&#10;bake throughout.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Please, also, open the wicket,&#34; she continued. &#34;And, in case a&#10;lame old beggar-woman should call, come and tell me. I am the&#10;Nadezhda Ivanovna for whom she will inquire. Do you&#10;understand?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;From the well, at this point, there issued the words:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Who is that speaking?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It is the mistress,&#34; I replied.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What? Nadezhda? With her I have a bone to pick.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What did he say?&#34; the woman asked tensely as she raised her&#10;dark, thinly pencilled brows, and made as though to go and lean&#10;over the well. Independently of my own volition I forestalled what&#10;Gubin might next have been going to say by remarking:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I must tell you that last night he saw you walking in the&#10;garden here.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Indeed?&#34; she ejaculated, and drew herself to her full height.&#10;Yet in doing so she blushed to her shoulders, and, clapping plump&#10;hands to her bosom, and opening dark eyes to their fullest, said in&#10;a hasty and confused whisper as, again paling and shrinking in&#10;stature, she subsided like a piece of pastry that is turning&#10;heavy:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Good Lord! WHAT did he see?&#8230; If the lame woman should call, you&#10;must not admit her. No, tell her that she will not be wanted, that&#10;I cannot, that I must not&#8212;But see here. Here is a rouble for you.&#10;Oh, good Lord!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;By this time even louder and more angry exclamations had begun&#10;to ascend from Gubin. Yet the only sound to reach my ears was the&#10;woman&#39;s muttered whispering, and as I glanced into her face I&#10;perceived that its hitherto high-coloured and rounded contours had&#10;fallen in, and turned grey, and that her flushed lips were&#10;trembling to such an extent as almost to prevent the articulation&#10;of her words. Lastly, her eyes were frozen into an expression of&#10;pitiful, doglike terror.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Suddenly she shrugged her shoulders, straightened her form, put&#10;away from her the expression of terror, and said quietly, but&#10;incisively:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You will not need to say anything about this. Allow me.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And with a swaying step she departed&#8212;a step so short as almost&#10;to convey the impression that her legs were bound together. Yet&#10;while the gait was the gait of a person full of suppressed fury, it&#10;was also the gait of a person who can scarcely see an inch in&#10;advance.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Haul away, you!&#34; shouted Gubin.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I hauled him up in a state of cold and wet; whereafter he fell&#10;to stamping around the coping of the well, cursing, and waving his&#10;arms.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What have you been thinking of all this time?&#34; he vociferated.&#10;&#34;Why, for ever so long I shouted and shouted to you!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I have been telling Nadezhda that last night you saw her&#10;walking in the garden.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He sprang towards me with a vicious scowl.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Who gave you leave to do so?&#34; he exclaimed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Wait a moment. I said that it was only in a dream, that you saw&#10;her crossing the garden to the washhouse.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Indeed? And why did you do that?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Somehow, as, barelegged and dripping with mud, he stood blinking&#10;his eyes at me with a most disagreeable expression, he looked&#10;extremely comical.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;See here,&#34; I remarked, &#34;you have only to go and tell her&#10;husband about her for me to go and tell him the same story about&#10;your having seen the whole thing in a dream.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why?&#34; cried Gubin, now almost beside himself. Presently,&#10;however, he recovered sufficient self-possession to grin and ask in&#10;an undertone:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;HOW MUCH DID SHE GIVE YOU?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I explained to him that my sole reason for what I had done had&#10;been that I pitied the woman, and feared lest the brothers Birkin&#10;should do an injury to one who at least ought not to be betrayed.&#10;Gubin began by declining to believe me, but eventually, after the&#10;matter had been thought out, said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Acceptance of money for doing what is right is certainly&#10;irregular; but at least is it better than acceptance of money for&#10;conniving at sin. Well, you have spoilt my scheme, young fellow.&#10;Hired only to clean out the well, I would nevertheless have cleaned&#10;out the establishment as a whole, and taken pleasure in doing&#10;so.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then once more he relapsed into fury, and muttered as he&#10;scurried round and round the well:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;How DARED you poke your nose into other people&#39;s affairs? Who&#10;are YOU in this establishment?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The air was hot and arid, yet still the sky was as dull as&#10;though coated throughout with the dust of summer, and, as yet, one&#10;could gaze at the sun&#39;s purple, rayless orb without blinking, and&#10;as easily as one could have gazed at the glowing embers of a wood&#10;fire.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Seated on the fence, a number of rooks were directing&#10;intelligent black eyes upon the heaps of mud which lay around the&#10;coping of the well. And from time to time they fluttered their&#10;wings impatiently, and cawed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I got you some work,&#34; Gubin continued in a grumbling tone, &#34;and&#10;put heart into you with the prospect of employment. And now you&#10;have gone and treated me like&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At this point I caught the sound of a horse trotting towards the&#10;entrance-gates, and heard someone shout, as the animal drew level&#10;with the house:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;YOUR timber too has caught alight!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Instantly, frightened by the shout, the rooks took to their&#10;wings and flew away. Also, a window sash squeaked, and the&#10;courtyard resounded with sudden bustle&#8212;the culinary regions&#10;vomiting the elderly lady and the tousled, half-clad Jonah; and an&#10;open window the upper half of the red-headed Peter.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Men, harness up as quickly as possible!&#34; the latter cried, his&#10;voice charged with a plaintive note.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And, indeed, he had hardly spoken before Gubin led out a fat&#10;roan pony, and Jonah pulled from a shelter a light buggy or&#10;britchka. Meanwhile Nadezhda called from the veranda to Jonah:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Do you first go in and dress yourself!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The elderly lady then unfastened the gates; whereupon a stunted,&#10;oldish muzhik in a red shirt limped into the yard with a&#10;foam-flecked steed, and exclaimed:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It is caught in two places&#8212;at the Savelkin clearing and near&#10;the cemetery!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Immediately the company pressed around him with groans and&#10;ejaculations, and Gubin alone continued to harness the pony with&#10;swift and dexterous hands&#8212;saying to me through his teeth as he did&#10;so, and without looking at anyone:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That is how those wretched folk ALWAYS defer things until too&#10;late.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The next person to present herself at the entrance gates was a&#10;beggar-woman. Screwing up her eyes in a furtive manner, she&#10;droned:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;For the sake of Lord Je-e-esus!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;God will give you alms! God will give you alms!&#34; was Nadezhda&#39;s&#10;reply as, turning pale, she flung out her arms in the old woman&#39;s&#10;direction. &#34;You see, a terrible thing has happened&#8212;our timber lands&#10;have caught fire. You must come again later.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Upon that Peter&#39;s bulky form (which had entirely filled the&#10;window from which it had been leaning), disappeared with a jerk,&#10;and in its stead there came into view the figure of a woman. Said&#10;she contemptuously:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;See the visitation with which God has tried us, you men of&#10;faint hearts and indolent hands!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The woman&#39;s hair was grey at the temples, and had resting upon&#10;it a silken cap which so kept changing colour in the sunlight as to&#10;convey to one the impression that her head was bonneted with steel,&#10;while in her face, picturesque but dark (seemingly blackened with&#10;smoke), there gleamed two pupil-less blue eyes of a kind which I&#10;had never before beheld.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Fools,&#34; she continued, &#34;how often have I not pointed out to you&#10;the necessity of cutting a wider space between the timber and the&#10;cemetery?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;From a furrow above the woman&#39;s small but prominent nose, a pair&#10;of heavy brows extended to temples that were silvered over. As she&#10;spoke there fell a strange silence amid which save for the pony&#39;s&#10;pawing of the mire no sound mingled with the sarcastic reproaches&#10;of the deep, almost masculine voice.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That again is the mother-in-law,&#34; was my inward reflection.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Gubin finished the harnessing&#8212;then said to Jonah in the tone of&#10;a superior addressing a servant:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Go in and dress yourself, you object!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Nevertheless, the Birkins drove out of the yard precisely as&#10;they were, while the peasant mounted his belathered steed and&#10;followed them at a trot; and the elderly lady disappeared from the&#10;window, leaving its panes even darker and blacker than they had&#10;previously been. Gubin, slip-slopping through the puddles with bare&#10;feet, said to me with a sharp glance as he moved to shut the&#10;entrance gates:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I presume that I can now take in hand the little affair of&#10;which you know.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yakov!&#34; at this juncture someone shouted from the house.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Gubin straightened himself a la militaire.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, I am coming,&#34; he replied.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Whereafter, padding on bare soles, he ascended the steps.&#10;Nadezhda, standing at their top, turned away with a frown of&#10;repulsion at his approach, and nodded and beckoned to myself.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What has Yakov said to you?&#34; she inquired&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;He has been reproaching me.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Reproaching you for what?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;For having spoken to you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She heaved a sigh.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ah, the mischief-maker!&#34; she exclaimed. &#34;And what is it that he&#10;wants?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As she pouted her displeasure her round and vacant face looked&#10;almost childlike.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Good Lord!&#34; she added. &#34;What DO such men as he want?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Meanwhile the heavens were becoming overspread with dark grey&#10;clouds, and presaging a flood of autumn rain, while from the window&#10;near the steps the voice of Peter&#39;s mother-in-law was issuing in a&#10;steady stream. At first, however, nothing was distinguishable save&#10;a sound like the humming of a spindle.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It is my mother that is speaking,&#34; Nadezhda explained softly.&#10;&#34;She&#39;ll give it him! Yes, SHE will protect me!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Yet I scarcely heard Nadezhda&#39;s words, so greatly was I feeling&#10;struck with the quiet forcefulness, the absolute assurance, of what&#10;was being said within the window.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Enough, enough!&#34; said the voice. &#34;Only through lack of&#10;occupation have you joined the company of the righteous.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Upon this I made a move to approach closer to the window;&#10;whereupon Nadezhda whispered:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Whither are you going? You must not listen.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;While she was yet speaking I heard come from the window:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Similarly your revolt against mankind has come of idleness, of&#10;lack of an interest in life. To you the world has been wearisome,&#10;so, while devising this revolt as a resource, you have excused it&#10;on the ground of service of God and love of equity, while in&#10;reality constituting yourself the devil&#39;s workman.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Here Nadezhda plucked at my sleeve, and tried to pull me away,&#10;but I remarked:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I MUST learn what Gubin has got to say in answer.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;This made Nadezhda smile, and then whisper with a confiding&#10;glance at my face:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You see, I have made a full confession to her. I went and said&#10;to her: &#39;Mamenka, I have had a misfortune.&#39; And her only reply as&#10;she stroked my hair was, &#39;Ah, little fool!&#39; Thus you see that she&#10;pities me. And what makes her care the less that I should stray in&#10;that direction is that she yearns for me to bear her a child, a&#10;grandchild, as an heir to her property.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Next, Gubin was heard saying within the room:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Whensoever an offence is done against the law I&#8230; &#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At once a stream of impressive words from the other drowned his&#10;utterance:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;An offence is not always an offence of moment, since sometimes&#10;a person outgrows the law, and finds it too restrictive. No one&#10;person ought to be rated against another. For whom alone ought we&#10;to fear? Only the God in whose sight all of us have erred!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And though in the elderly lady&#39;s voice there was weariness and&#10;distaste, the words were spoken slowly and incisively. Upon this&#10;Gubin tried to murmur something or another, but again his utterance&#10;failed to edge its way into his interlocutor&#39;s measured&#10;periods:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No great achievement is it,&#34; she said, &#34;to condemn a fellow&#10;creature. For always it is easy to sit in judgment upon our&#10;fellows. And even if a fellow creature be allowed to pursue an evil&#10;course unchecked, his offence may yet prove productive of good.&#10;Remember how in every case the Saints reached God. Yet how truly&#10;sanctified, by the time that they did so reach Him, were they? Let&#10;this ever be borne in mind, for we are over-apt to condemn and&#10;punish!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;In former days, Natalia Vassilievna, you took away from me my&#10;substance, you took my all. Also, let me recount to you how we fell&#10;into disagreement.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No; there is no need for that.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Thereafter, I ceased to be able to bear the contemplation of&#10;myself; I ceased to consider myself as of any value.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Let the past remain the past. That which must be is not to be&#10;avoided.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Through you, I say, I lost my peace of mind.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Nadezhda nudged me, and whispered with gay malice:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That is probably true, for they say that once he was one of her&#10;lovers.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then she recollected herself and, clapping her hands to her&#10;face, cried through her fingers:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh good Lord! What have I said? No, no, you must not believe&#10;these tales. They are only slanders, for she is the best of&#10;women.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;When evil has been done,&#34; continued the quiet voice within the&#10;window, &#34;it can never be set right by recounting it to others. He&#10;upon whom a burden has been laid should try to bear it. And, should&#10;he fail to bear it, the fact will mean that the burden has been&#10;beyond his strength.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It was through you that I lost everything. It was you that&#10;stripped me bare.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But to that which you lost I added movement. Nothing in life is&#10;ever lost; it merely passes from one hand to another&#8212;from the&#10;unskilled hand to the experienced&#8212;so that even the bone picked of a&#10;dog may ultimately become of value.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, a bone&#8212;that is what I am.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why should you say that? You are still a man.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, a man, but a man useful for what?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Useful, even though the use may not yet be fully apparent.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;To this, after a pause, the speaker added:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Now, depart in peace, and make no further attempt against this&#10;woman. Nay, do not even speak ill of her if you can help it, but&#10;consider everything that you saw to have been seen in a dream.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ah!&#34; was Gubin&#39;s contrite cry. &#34;It shall be as you say. Yet,&#10;though I should hate, I could not bear, to grieve you, I must&#10;confess that the height whereon you stand is&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Is what, Oh friend of mine?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Nothing; save that of all souls in this world you are, without&#10;exception, the best.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yakov Petrovitch, in this world you and I might have ended our&#10;lives together in honourable partnership. And even now, if God be&#10;willing, we might do so.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No. Rather must farewell be said.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;All became quiet within the window, except that after a&#10;prolonged silence there came from the woman a deep sigh, and then a&#10;whisper of, &#34;Oh Lord!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Treading softly, like a cat, Nadezhda darted away towards the&#10;steps; whereas I, less fortunate, was caught by the departing Gubin&#10;in the very act of leaving the neighbourhood of the window. Upon&#10;that he inflated his cheeks, ruffled up his sandy hair, turned red&#10;in the face like a man who has been through a fight, and cried in&#10;strange, querulous, high-pitched accents:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Hi! What were you doing just now? Long-legged devil that you&#10;are, I have no further use for you&#8212;I do not intend to work with you&#10;any more. So you can go.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At the same moment the dim face, with its great blue eyes,&#10;showed itself at the window, and the stem voice inquired:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What does the noise mean?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What does it mean? It means that I do not intend&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You must not, if you wish to create a disturbance, do it&#10;anywhere but in the street. It must not be created here.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What is all this?&#34; Nadezhda put in with a stamp of her foot.&#10;&#34;What&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At this point, the cook rushed out with a toasting-fork and&#10;militantly ranged herself by Nadezhda&#39;s side, exclaiming:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;See what comes of not having a single muzhik in the house!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I now prepared to withdraw, but, in doing so, glanced once more&#10;at the features of the elderly lady, and saw that the blue pupils&#10;were dilated so as almost to fill the eyes in their entirety, and&#10;to leave only a bluish margin. And strange and painful were those&#10;eyes&#8212;eyes fixed blindly, eyes which seemed to have strayed from&#10;their orbits through yielding to emotion and a consequent&#10;overstrain&#8212;while the apple of the throat had swelled like the crop&#10;of a bird, and the sheen of the silken head-dress become as the&#10;sheen of metal. Involuntarily, I thought to myself:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It is a head that must be made of iron.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;By this time Gubin had penitently subsided, and was exchanging&#10;harmless remarks with the cook, while carefully avoiding my&#10;glance.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Good day to you, madame,&#34; at length I said as I passed the&#10;window.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Not at once did she reply, but when she did so she said&#10;kindly:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And good day to YOU, my friend. Yes, I wish you good day.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;To which she added an inclination of the head which resembled&#10;nothing so much as a hammer which much percussion upon an anvil has&#10;wrought to a fine polish.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 19, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/3920')

Its houses, with their many-coloured shutters,&#10;stand so crowded together as to form around the churches and gloomy&#10;law courts a perfect maze&#8212;the streets which intersect the dark&#10;masses of houses meandering aimlessly hither and thither, and&#10;throwing off alleyways as narrow as sleeves, and feeling their way&#10;along plot-fences and warehouse walls, until, viewed from the&#10;hillock above, the town looks as though someone has stirred it up&#10;with a stick and dispersed and confused everything that it&#10;contains. Only from the point where Great Zhitnaia Street takes its&#10;rise from the river do the stone mansions of the local merchants&#10;(for the most part German colonists) cut a grim, direct line&#10;through the packed clusters of buildings constructed of wood, and&#10;skirt the green islands of gardens, and thrust aside the churches;&#10;whereafter, continuing its way through Council Square (still&#10;running inexorably straight), the thoroughfare stretches to, and&#10;traverses, a barren plain of scrub, and so reaches the pine&#10;plantation belonging to the Monastery of St. Michael the Archangel&#10;where the latter is lurking behind a screen of old red spruces of&#10;which the denseness seems to prop the very heavens, and which on&#10;clear, sunny days can be seen rising to mark the spot whence the&#10;monastery&#39;s crosses, like the gilded birds of the forest of eternal&#10;silence, scintillate a constant welcome.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At a distance of some ten houses before Zhitnaia Street&#10;debouches upon the plain which I have mentioned there begin to&#10;diverge from the street and to trend towards a ravine, and&#10;eventually to lose themselves in the latter&#39;s recesses, the small,&#10;squat shanties with one or two windows apiece which constitute the&#10;suburb of Tolmachikha. This suburb, it may be said, had as its&#10;original founders the menials of a landowner named Tolmachev&#8212;a&#10;landowner who, after emancipating his serfs some thirteen years&#10;before all serfs were legally emancipated, [In the year 1861] was,&#10;for his action, visited with such bitter revilement that, in dire&#10;offence at the same, he ended by becoming an inmate of the&#10;monastery, and there spending ten years under the vow of silence,&#10;until death overtook him amid a peaceful obscurity born of the fact&#10;that the authorities had forbidden his exhibition to pilgrims or&#10;strangers.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It is in the very cots originally apportioned to Tolmachev&#39;s&#10;menials, at the time, fifty years ago, when those menials were&#10;converted into citizens, that the present inhabitants of the suburb&#10;dwell. And never have they been burnt out of those homes, although&#10;the same period has seen all Buev save Zhitnaia Street consumed,&#10;and everywhere that one may delve within the township one will be&#10;sure to come across undestroyed hearthstones.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The suburb, as I have said, stands at the hither end and on the&#10;sloping side of one of the arms of a deep, wooded ravine, with its&#10;windows facing towards the ravine&#39;s yawning mouth, and affording a&#10;view direct to the Mokrie (certain marshes beyond the Obericha) and&#10;the swampy forest of firs into which the dim red sun declines.&#10;Further on, the ravine trends across the plain, then bends round&#10;towards the western side of the town, cats away the clayey soil&#10;with an appetite which each spring increases, and which, carrying&#10;the soil down to the river, is gradually clogging the river&#39;s flow,&#10;diverting the muddy water towards the marshes, and converting those&#10;marshes into a lagoon outright. The fissure in question is named&#10;&#34;The Great Ravine,&#34; and has its steep flanks so overgrown with&#10;chestnuts and laburnums that even in summertime its recesses are&#10;cool and moist, and so serve as a convenient trysting place for the&#10;poorer lovers of the suburb and the town, and witness their tea&#10;drinkings and frequently fatal quarrels, as well as being used by&#10;the more well-to-do for a dumping ground for rubbish of the nature&#10;of deceased dogs, cats, and horses.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Pleasantly singing, there scours the bottom of the ravine the&#10;brook known as the Zhandarmski Spring, a brook celebrated&#10;throughout Buev for its crystal-cold water, which is so icy of&#10;temperature that even on a burning day it will make the teeth ache.&#10;This water the denizens of Tolmachikha account to be their peculiar&#10;property; wherefore they are proud of it, and drink it to the&#10;exclusion of any other, and so live to a green old age which in&#10;some cases cannot even reckon its years. And by way of a&#10;livelihood, the men of the suburb indulge in hunting, fishing,&#10;fowling, and thieving (not a single artisan proper does the suburb&#10;contain, save the cobbler Gorkov&#8212;a thin, consumptive skeleton of&#10;surname Tchulan); while, as regards the women, they, in winter, sew&#10;and make sacks for Zimmel&#39;s mill, and pull tow, and in summer they&#10;scour the plantation of the monastery for truffles and other&#10;produce, and the forest on the other side of the river for&#10;huckleberries. Also, two of the suburb&#39;s women practise as fortune&#10;tellers, while two others conduct an easy and highly lucrative&#10;trade in prostitution.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The result is that the town, as distinguished from the suburb,&#10;believes the men of the latter to be one and all thieves, and the&#10;women and girls of the suburb to be one and all disreputable&#10;characters. Hence the town strives always to restrict and extirpate&#10;the suburb, while the suburbans retaliate upon the townsfolk with&#10;robbery and arson and murder, while despising those townsfolk for&#10;their parsimony, decorum, and avarice, and detesting the settled,&#10;comfortable mode of life which they lead.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So poor, for that matter, is the suburb that never do even&#10;beggars resort thither, save when drunk. No, the only creatures&#10;which resort thither are dogs which subsist no one knows how as&#10;predatorily they roam from court to court with tails tucked between&#10;their flanks, and bloodless tongues hanging down, and legs ever&#10;prepared, on sighting a human being, to bolt into the ravine, or to&#10;let down their owners upon subservient bellies in expectation of a&#10;probable kick or curse.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In short, every cranny of every cot in the place, with the grimy&#10;panes of their windows, and their lathed roofs overgrown with&#10;velvety moss, breathes forth the universal, deadly hopelessness&#10;induced by Russia&#39;s crushing poverty.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In the Tolmachikhans&#39; backyards grow only alders, elders, and&#10;weeds. Everywhere docks thrust up heads through cracks in the&#10;fences to catch at the legs or the skirts of passers-by, while&#10;masses of nettles squeeze their way under fences to sting little&#10;children. Apropos, the latter are all thin and hungry, in the&#10;highest degree quarrelsome, and addicted to prolonged lamentation.&#10;Also, each spring sees a certain proportion of their number carried&#10;off by diphtheria, while scarlatina and measles are as epidemic&#10;among them as is typhoid among their elders.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Thus the sounds of life most to be heard throughout the suburb&#10;are the sounds either of weeping or of mad cursing. In general,&#10;however, life in Tolmachikha is lived quietly and lethargically. So&#10;much is this the case that in spring even the cats forbear to&#10;squall save in crushed and subdued accents. The only local person&#10;to sing is Felitzata; and even she does so only when she is drunk.&#10;It may be said that Felitzata is a saucy, cunning procuress, and&#10;does her singing in a peculiarly thick and rasping voice which,&#10;with many croaks and hiatuses, necessitates much closing of the&#10;eyes, and a great protruding of the apple of the throat. Indeed, it&#10;is only the women of the place who, turbulently quarrelsome and&#10;hysterically noisy, spend most of the day in scouring the streets&#10;with skirts tucked up, and never cease begging for pinches of salt&#10;or flour or spoonfuls of oil as they rail and screech at and beat&#10;their children, and thrust withered breasts into their babies&#39;&#10;mouths, and rush and fling themselves about, and bawl in a constant&#10;endeavour to right their woebegone condition. Yes, all are&#10;dishevelled and dirty, and have wizened, bony faces, and the&#10;restless eyes of thieves. Never, indeed, is a woman plump of&#10;figure, save at the period when she is ill, and her eyes are dim,&#10;and her gait is laboured. Yet until they are forty, the majority of&#10;the women become pregnant with every winter, and on the arrival of&#10;spring may be seen walking abroad with large stomachs and blue&#10;hollows under the eyes. And even this does not prevent them from&#10;working with the same desperate energy as when they are not with&#10;child. In short, the inhabitants of the place resemble needles and&#10;threads with which some rough, clumsy, and impatient hand is for&#10;ever trying to darn a ragged cloth which as constantly parts and&#10;rends.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The chief person of repute in the suburb is my landlord, one&#10;Antipa Vologonov&#8212;a little old man who keeps a shop of &#34;odd wares,&#34;&#10;and also lends money on pledge.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Unfortunately, Antipa is a sufferer from a long-standing&#10;tendency to rheumatism, which has left him bow-legged, and has&#10;twisted and swollen his fingers to the extent that they will not&#10;bend. Hence, he always keeps his hands tucked into his sleeves,&#10;though seemingly he has the less use for them in that, even when he&#10;withdraws them from their shelter, he does so as cautiously as&#10;though he were afraid of their becoming dislocated.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;On the other hand, he never loses his temper, and he never grows&#10;excited.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Neither of those things suits me,&#34; he will say, &#34;for my heart&#10;is dilated, and might at any moment fail.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As for his face, it has high cheekbones which in places blossom&#10;into dark red blotches; an expression as calm as that of the face&#10;of a Khirghiz; a chin whence dangle wisps of mingled grey, red, and&#10;flaxen hair of a perpetually moist appearance; oblique and&#10;ever-changing eyes which are permanently contracted; a pair of&#10;thick, parti-coloured eyebrows which cast deep shadows over the&#10;eyes; and temples whereon a number of blue veins struggle with an&#10;irregular, sparse coating of bristles. Finally, about his whole&#10;personality there is something ever variable and intangible.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Also, his gait is irritatingly slow; and the more so owing to&#10;his coat, which, of a cut devised by himself, consists, as it were,&#10;of cassock, sarafan [jacket], and waistcoat in one. As often as not&#10;he finds the skirts of the garment cumbering his legs; whereupon he&#10;has to stop and give them a kick. And thus it comes about that&#10;permanently the skirts are ragged and torn.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No need for hurry,&#34; is his customary remark. &#34;Always, in time,&#10;does one win to one&#39;s pitch in the marketplace.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;His speech is cast in rounded periods, and displays a great love&#10;for ecclesiastical terms. On the occurrence of one such term, he&#10;pauses thereafter as though mentally he were adding to the term a&#10;very thick, a very black, full stop. Yet always he will converse&#10;with anyone, and at great length&#8212;his probable motive being a desire&#10;to leave behind him the reputation of a wise old man.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In his shanty are three windows facing on to the street, and a&#10;partition-wall which divides it into two rooms of unequal size. In&#10;the larger room, which contains a Russian stove, he himself lives;&#10;in the smaller room I have my abode. By a passage the two are&#10;separated from a storeroom where, closeted behind a door to which&#10;there are a heavy, old-fashioned bolt and many iron and brass&#10;screws, Antipa preserves pledges left by his neighbours, such as&#10;samovars, ikons, winter clothing and the like. Of this storeroom he&#10;always carries the great indentated key at the back of the strap&#10;which upholds his cloth breeches; and, whenever the police call to&#10;ascertain whether he is harbouring any stolen goods, a long time&#10;ensues whilst he is shifting the key round to his stomach, and&#10;again a long time whilst he is unfastening it from the belt.&#10;Meanwhile, he says pompously to the Superintendent or the Deputy&#10;Superintendent:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Never do I take in goods of that kind. Of the truth of what I&#10;say, your honour, you have more than once assured yourself in&#10;person.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Also, whenever Antipa sits down the key rattles against the back&#10;or the seat of his chair; whereupon he bends his arm with&#10;difficulty, and feels to see whether or not the key has come&#10;unslung. This I know for the reason that the partition-wall is not&#10;so thick but that I can hear his every breath drawn, and divine his&#10;every movement.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Of an evening, when the misty sun is slanting across the river&#10;towards the auburn belt of pines, and distilling pink vapours from&#10;the sombre vista to be seen through the shaggy mouth of the ravine,&#10;Antipa Vologonov sets out a squat samovar that is dinted of side,&#10;and plated with green oxide on handle, turncock, and spout. Then he&#10;seats himself at his table by the window.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At intervals I hear the evening stillness broken by questions&#10;put in a tone which implies always an expectation of a precise&#10;answer.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Where is Darika?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;He has gone to the spring for water.&#34; The answer is given&#10;whiningly, and in a thin voice.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And how is your sister?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Still in pain.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes? Well, you can go now.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Giving a slight cough to clear his throat, the old man begins to&#10;sing in a quavering falsetto:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Once a bullet smote my breast,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;And scarce the pang I felt.&#60;br /&#62;&#10;But ne&#39;er the pang could be express&#39;d&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Which love&#39;s flame since hath dealt!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As the samovar hisses and bubbles, heavy footsteps resound in&#10;the street, and an indistinct voice says:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;He thinks that because he is a Town Councillor he is also&#10;clever.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes; such folk are apt to grow very proud.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why, all his brains put together wouldn&#39;t grease one of my&#10;boots!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And as the voices die away the old man&#39;s falsetto trickles forth&#10;anew, humming:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The poor man&#39;s anger&#8230; Minika! Hi, you! Come in here, and I will&#10;give you a bit of sugar. How is your father getting on? Is he drunk&#10;at present?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No, sober, for he is taking nothing but kvas and cabbage&#10;soup.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And what is he doing for a living?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Sitting at the table, and thinking.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And has your mother been beating him again?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No&#8212;not again.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And she&#8212;how is she?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Obliged to keep indoors.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well, run along with you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Softly there next presents herself before the window Felitzata,&#10;a woman of about forty with a hawk-like gleam in her coldly civil&#10;eyes, and a pair of handsome lips compressed into a covert smile.&#10;She is well known throughout the suburb, and once had a son,&#10;Nilushka, who was the local &#34;God&#39;s fool.&#34; Also she has the&#10;reputation of knowing what is correct procedure on all and sundry&#10;occasions, as well as of being skilled in lamentations, funeral&#10;rites, and festivities in connection with the musterings of&#10;recruits. Lastly she has had a hip broken, so that she walks with&#10;an inclination towards the left.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Her fellow women say of her that her veins contain &#34;a drop of&#10;gentle blood&#34;; but probably the statement is inspired by no more&#10;than the fact that she treats everyone with the same cold civility.&#10;Nevertheless, there is something peculiar about her, for her hands&#10;are slender and have long fingers, and her head is haughtily&#10;poised, and her voice has a metallic ring, even though the metal&#10;has, as it were, grown dull and rusty. Also, she speaks of&#10;everyone, herself included, in the most rough and downright terms,&#10;yet terms which are so simple that, though her talk may be&#10;disconcerting to listen to, it could never be called obscene.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For instance, once I overheard Vologonov reproach her for not&#10;leading a more becoming life:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You ought to have more self-restraint,&#34; said he, &#34;seeing that&#10;you are a lady, and also your own mistress.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That is played out, my friend,&#34; she replied. &#34;You see, I have&#10;had very much to bear, for there was a time when such hunger used&#10;to gnaw at my belly as you would never believe. It was then that my&#10;eyes became dazzled with the tokens of shame. So I took my fill of&#10;love, as does every woman. And once a woman has become a&#10;light-o&#39;-love she may as well doff her shift altogether, and use&#10;the body which God has given her. And, after all, an independent&#10;life is the best life; so I hawk myself about like a pot of beer,&#10;and say, &#39;Drink of this, anyone who likes, while it still contains&#10;liquor.&#39;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It makes one feel ashamed to hear such talk,&#34; said Vologonov&#10;with a sigh. In response she burst out laughing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What a virtuous man!&#34; was her comment upon his remark.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Until now Antipa had spoken cautiously, and in an undertone,&#10;whereas the woman had replied in loud accents of challenge.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Will you come in and have some tea?&#34; he said next as he leant&#10;out of the window.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No, I thank you. In passing, what a thing I have heard about&#10;you!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Do not shout so loud. Of what are you speaking?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh, of SUCH a thing!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Of NOTHING, I imagine.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, of EVERYTHING.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;God, who created all things, alone knows everything.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Whereafter the pair whispered together awhile. Then Felitzata&#10;disappeared as suddenly as she had come, leaving the old man&#10;sitting motionless. At length he heaved a profound sigh, and&#10;muttered to himself.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Into that Eve&#39;s ears be there poured the poison of the asp!&#8230;&#10;Yet pardon me, Oh God! Yea, pardon me!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The words contained not a particle of genuine contrition.&#10;Rather, I believe, he uttered them because he had a weakness not&#10;for words which signified anything, but for words which, being out&#10;of the way, were not used by the common folk of the suburb.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Sometimes Vologonov knocks at the partition-wall with a&#10;superannuated arshin measure which has only fifteen vershoki of its&#10;length remaining. He knocks, and shouts:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Lodger, would you care to join me in a pot of tea?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;During the early days of our acquaintanceship he regarded me&#10;with marked and constant suspicion. Clearly he deemed me to be a&#10;police detective. But subsequently he took to scanning my face with&#10;critical curiosity, until at length he said with an air of&#10;imparting instruction:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Have you ever read Paradise Lost and Destroyed?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No,&#34; I replied. &#34;Only Paradise Regained.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;This led him to wag his parti-coloured beard in token that &#39;he&#10;disagreed with my choice&#39;, and to observe:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The reason why Adam lost Paradise is that he allowed Eve to&#10;corrupt him. And never did the Lord permit him to regain it. For&#10;who is worthy to return to the gates of Paradise? Not a single&#10;human being.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And, indeed, I found it a waste of time to dispute the matter,&#10;for he merely listened to what I had to say, and then, without an&#10;attempt at refutation, repeated in the same tone as before, and&#10;exactly in the same words, his statement that &#34;Adam lost Paradise&#10;for the reason that he allowed Eve to corrupt him.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Similarly did women constitute our most usual subject of&#10;conversation.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You are young,&#34; once he said, &#34;and therefore a human being&#10;bound to find forbidden fruit blocking your way at every step. This&#10;because the human race is a slave to its love of sin, or, in other&#10;words, to love of the Serpent. Yes, woman constitutes the prime&#10;impediment to everything in life, as history has many times&#10;affirmed. And first and foremost is she the source of restlessness.&#10;&#39;Charged with poison, the Serpent shall plunge in thee her fangs.&#39;&#10;Which Serpent is, of course, our desire of the flesh, the Serpent&#10;at whose instigation the Greeks razed towns to the ground, and&#10;ravaged Troy and Carthagena and Egypt, and the Serpent which caused&#10;an amorous passion for the sister of Alexander Pavlovitch [The&#10;Emperor Alexander I] to bring about Napoleon&#39;s invasion of Russia.&#10;On the other hand, both the Mohammedan nations and the Jews have&#10;from earliest times grasped the matter aright, and kept their women&#10;shut up in their back premises; whereas WE permit the foulest of&#10;profligacy to exist, and walk hand in hand with our women, and&#10;allow them to graduate as female doctors and to pull teeth, and all&#10;the rest of it. The truth is that they ought not to be allowed to&#10;advance beyond midwife, since it is woman&#39;s business either to&#10;serve as a breeding animal or opprobriously to be called&#10;neiskusobrachnaia neviesta [Maid who hast never tasted of&#10;marriage.] Yes, woman&#39;s business should end there.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Near the stove there ticks and clicks on the grimy wall that is&#10;papered with &#34;rules and regulations&#34; and sheets of yellow&#10;manuscript the pendulum of a small clock, with, hanging to one of&#10;its weights, a hammer and a horseshoe, and, to the other, a copper&#10;pestle. Also, in a corner of the room a number of ikons make a&#10;glittering show with their silver applique and the gilded halos&#10;which surmount their figures&#39; black visages, while a stove with a&#10;ponderous grate glowers out of the window at the greenery in&#10;Zhitnaia Street and beyond the ravine (beyond the ravine everything&#10;looks bright and beautiful), and the dusty, dimly lighted storeroom&#10;across the passage emits a perennial odour of dried mushroom,&#10;tobacco leaves, and hemp oil.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Vologonov stirs his strong, stewed tea with a battered old&#10;teaspoon, and says with a sigh as he sips a little:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;All my life I have been engaged in gaining experience so that&#10;now I know most things, and ought to be listened to with attention.&#10;Usually folk do so listen to me, but though here and there one may&#10;find a living soul, of the rest it may be said: &#39;In the House of&#10;David shall terrible things come to pass, and fire shall consume&#10;the spirit of lechery.&#39;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The words resemble bricks in that they seem, if possible, to&#10;increase the height of the walls of strange and extraneous events,&#10;and even stranger dramas, which loom for ever around, me.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;For example,&#34; continues the old man, &#34;why is Mitri Ermolaev&#10;Polukonov, our ex-mayor, lying dead before his time? Because he&#10;conceived a number of arrogant projects. For example, he sent his&#10;eldest son to study at Kazan&#8212;with the result that during the son&#39;s&#10;second year at the University he, the son, brought home with him a&#10;curly-headed Jewess, and said to his father: &#39;Without this woman I&#10;cannot live&#8212;in her are bound up my whole soul and strength.&#39; Yes, a&#10;pass indeed! And from that day forth nothing but misfortune befell&#10;in that Yashka took to drink, the Jewess gave way to repining, and&#10;Mitri had to go perambulating the town with piteous invitations to&#10;&#39;come and see, my brethren, to what depths I have sunk!&#39; And&#10;though, eventually, the Jewess died of a bloody flux, of a&#10;miscarriage, the past was beyond mending, and, while the son went&#10;to the bad, and took to drink for good and all, the father &#39;fell a&#10;victim by night to untimely death.&#39; Yes, the lives of two folk were&#10;thus undone by &#39;the thorn-bearing company of Judaea.&#39; Like&#10;ourselves, the Hebrew has a destiny of his own. And destiny cannot&#10;be driven out with a stick. Of each of us the destiny is unhasting.&#10;It moves slowly and quietly, and can never be avoided. &#39;Wait,&#39; it&#10;says. &#39;Seek not to press onward.&#39;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As he discourses, Vologonov&#39;s eyes ceaselessly change colour&#8212;now&#10;turning to a dull grey, and wearing a tired expression, and now&#10;becoming blue, and assuming a mournful air, and now (and most&#10;frequently of all) beginning to emit green flashes of an impartial&#10;malevolence.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Similarly, the Kapustins, once a powerful family, came at&#10;length to dust-became as nothing. It was a family the members of&#10;which were ever in favour of change, and devoted to anything that&#10;was new. In fact, they went and set up a piano! Well, of them only&#10;Valentine is still on his legs, and he (he is a doctor of less than&#10;forty years of age) is a hopeless drunkard, and saturated with&#10;dropsy, and fallen a prey to asthma, so that his cancerous eyes&#10;protrude horribly. Yes, the Kapustins, like the Polukonovs, may be&#10;&#39;written down as dead.&#39;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Throughout, Vologonov speaks in a tone of unassailable&#10;conviction, in a tone implying that never could things happen,&#10;never could things have happened, otherwise than as he has stated.&#10;In fact, in his hands even the most inexplicable, the most&#10;grievous, phenomena of life become such as a law has inevitably&#10;decreed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And the same thing will befall the Osmukhins,&#34; he next remarks.&#10;&#34;Let them be a warning to you never to make friends with Germans,&#10;and never to engage in business with them. In Russia any housewife&#10;may brew beer; yet our people will not drink it&#8212;they are more used&#10;to spirits. Also, Russian folk like to attain their object in&#10;drinking AT ONCE; and a shkalik of vodka will do more to sap wit&#10;than five kruzhki of beer. Once our people liked uniform&#10;simplicity; but now they are become like a man who was born blind,&#10;and has suddenly acquired sight. A change indeed! For thirty-three&#10;years did Ilya of Murom [Ilya Murometz, the legendary figure most&#10;frequently met with In Russian bilini (folk songs), and probably&#10;identical with Elijah the Prophet, though credited with many of the&#10;attributes proper, rather, to the pagan god Perun the Thunderer.]&#10;sit waiting for his end before it came; and all who cannot bide&#10;patiently in a state of humility&#8230; &#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Meanwhile clouds shaped like snow-white swans are traversing the&#10;roseate heavens and disappearing into space, while below them, on&#10;earth, the ravine can be seen spread out like the pelt of a bear&#10;which the broad shoulders of some fabulous giant have sloughed&#10;before taking refuge in the marshes and forest. In fact the&#10;landscape reminds me of sundry ancient tales of marvels, as also&#10;does Antipa Vologonov, the man who is so strangely conversant with&#10;the shortcomings of human life, and so passionately addicted to&#10;discussing them.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For a moment or two he remains silent as sibilantly he purses&#10;his lips and drinks some saffron-coloured tea from the saucer which&#10;the splayed fingers of his right hand are balancing on their tips.&#10;Whereafter, when his wet moustache has been dried, his level voice&#10;resumes its speech in tones as measured as those of one reading&#10;aloud from the Psalter.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Have you noticed a shop in Zhitnaia Street kept by an old man&#10;named Asiev? Once that man had ten sons. Six of them, however, died&#10;in infancy. Of the remainder the eldest, a fine singer, was at once&#10;extravagant and a bookworm; wherefore, whilst an officer&#39;s servant&#10;at Tashkend, he cut the throats of his master and mistress, and for&#10;doing so was executed by shooting. As a matter of fact, the tale&#10;has it that he had been making love to his mistress, and then been&#10;thrown over in favour of his master once more. And another son,&#10;Grigori, after being given a high school education at St.&#10;Petersburg, became a lunatic. And another, Alexei, entered the army&#10;as a cavalryman, but is now acting as a circus rider, and probably&#10;has also become a drunkard. And the youngest son of all, Nikolai,&#10;ran away as a boy, and, eventually arriving in Norway with a&#10;precious scheme for catching fish in the Arctic Ocean, met with&#10;failure through the fact that he had overlooked the circumstance&#10;that we Russians have fish of our own and to spare, and had to have&#10;his interest assigned by his father to a local monastery. So much&#10;for fish of the Arctic Seas! Yet if Nikolai had only waited, if he&#10;had only been more patient, he&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Here Vologonov lowers his voice, and continues with something of&#10;the growl of an angry dog:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I too have had sons, one of whom was killed at Kushka (a&#10;document has certified to that effect), another was drowned whilst&#10;drunk, three more died in infancy, and only two are still alive. Of&#10;these last, I know that one is acting as a waiter in a hotel at&#10;Smolensk, while the other, Melenti, was educated for the Church,&#10;sent to study in a seminary, induced to abscond and get into&#10;trouble, and eventually dispatched to Siberia. There now! Yes, the&#10;Russian is what might be called a &#39;lightweighted&#39; individual, an&#10;individual who, unless he holds himself down by the head, is soon&#10;carried off by the wind like a chicken&#39;s feather&#8212;for we are too&#10;self-confident and restless. Before now, I myself have been a gull,&#10;a man lacking balance: for never does youth realise its own&#10;insignificance, or know how to wait.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Dissertations of the kind drop from the old man like water from&#10;a leaky pipe on a cold, blustery day in autumn. Wagging his grey&#10;beard, he talks and talks, until I begin to think that he must be&#10;an evil wizard, and master of this remote, barren, swampy,&#10;ravine-pitted region&#8212;that he it is who originally planted the town&#10;in this uncomfortable, clayey hollow, and has thrown the houses&#10;into heaps, and entangled the streets, and wantonly created the&#10;town&#39;s unaccountably rude and rough and deadly existence, and&#10;addled men&#39;s brains with disconnected nonsense, and consumed their&#10;hearts with a fear of life. Yes, it comes to me that it must be he&#10;who, during the long six months of winter, causes cruel snowstorms&#10;from the plain to invade the town, and with frost compresses the&#10;buildings of the town until their rafters crack, and stinging cold&#10;brings birds to the ground. Lastly, I become seized with the idea&#10;that it must be he who, almost every summer, envelops the town in&#10;those terrible visitations of heat by night which seem almost to&#10;cause the houses to melt.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;However, as a rule he maintains complete silence, and merely&#10;makes chewing motions with his strong-toothed jaws as he sits&#10;wagging his beard from side to side. At such times there is in his&#10;eyes a bluish fire like the gleam of charcoal, while his crooked&#10;fingers writhe like worms, and his outward appearance becomes&#10;sheerly that of a magician of iniquity.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Once I asked him:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What in particular ought men to wait for?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For a while he sat clasping his beard, and, with contracted&#10;eyes, gazing as at something behind me. Then he said quietly and&#10;didactically:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Someday there will arise a Strange Man who will proclaim to the&#10;world the Word to which there never was a beginning. But to which&#10;of us is the hour when that Man will arise known? To none of us&#8230;&#10;And to which of us are known the miracles which that Word will&#10;perform? To none of us.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Once upon a time there used to glide past the window of my room&#10;the fair, curly, wavering, golden head of Nilushka the idiot, a lad&#10;looking like a thing which the earth has begotten of love. Yes,&#10;Nilushka was like an angel in some sacred picture adorning the&#10;southern or the northern gates of an ancient church, as, with his&#10;flushed face smeared with wax-smoke and oil, and his light blue&#10;eyes gleaming in a cold, unearthly smile, and a frame clad in a red&#10;smock reaching to below his knees, and the soles of his feet&#10;showing black (always he walked on tiptoe), and his thin calves, as&#10;straight and white as the calves of a woman, covered with golden&#10;down, he walked the streets.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Sometimes hopping along on one leg, and smiling, and waving his&#10;arms, and causing the ample folds and sleeves of his smock to&#10;flutter until he seemed to be moving in the midst of a nimbus,&#10;Nilushka would sing in a halting whisper the childish ditty:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p class=&#34;poem&#34;&#62;Oh Lo-ord, pardon me!&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Wo-olves run,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;And do-ogs run,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;And the hunters wait&#60;br /&#62;&#10;To kill the wolves.&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Oh Lo-ord, pardon me!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Meanwhile, he would diffuse a cheering atmosphere of happiness&#10;with which no one in the locality had anything in common. For he&#10;was ever a lighthearted, winning, essentially pure innocent of the&#10;type which never fails to evoke good-natured smiles and kindly&#10;emotions. Indeed, as he roamed the streets, the suburb seemed to&#10;live its life with less clamour, to appear more decent of outward&#10;guise, since the local folk looked upon the imbecile with far more&#10;indulgence than they did upon their own children; and he was&#10;intimate with, and beloved by, even the worst. Probably the reason&#10;for this was that the semblance of flight amid an atmosphere of&#10;golden dust which was his combined with his straight, slender&#10;little figure to put all who beheld him in mind of churches,&#10;angels, God, and Paradise. At all events, all viewed him in a&#10;manner contemplative, interested, and more than a little&#10;deferential.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A curious fact was the circumstance that whenever Nilushka&#10;sighted a stray gleam from a piece of glass, or the glitter of a&#10;morsel of copper in sunlight, he would halt dead where he was, turn&#10;grey with the ashiness of death, lose his smile, and remain&#10;dilating to an unnatural extent his clouded and troubled eyes. And&#10;so, with his whole form distorted with horror, and his thin hand&#10;crossing himself, and his knees trembling, and his smock fluttering&#10;around his frail wisp of a body, and his features growing&#10;stonelike, he would, for an hour or more, continue to stand, until&#10;at length someone laid a hand in his, and led him home.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The tale had it that, in the first instance, born &#34;soft-headed,&#34;&#10;he finally lost his reason, five years before the period of which I&#10;am writing, when a great fire occurred, and that thenceforth&#10;anything, save sunlight, that in any way resembled fire plunged him&#10;into this torpor of dumb dread. Naturally the people of the suburb&#10;devoted to him a great deal of attention.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;There goes God&#39;s fool,&#34; would be their remark. &#34;It will not be&#10;long before he dies and becomes a Saint, and we fall down and&#10;worship him.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Yet there were persons who would go so far as to crack rude&#10;jests at his expense. For instance, as he would be skipping along,&#10;with his childish voice raised in his little ditty, some idler or&#10;another would shout from a window, or through the cranny of a&#10;fence:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Hi, Nilushka! Fire! Fire!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Whereupon the angel-faced imbecile would sink to earth as though&#10;his legs had been cut away at the knee from under him, and he would&#10;huddle, frantically clutching his golden head in his permanently&#10;soiled hands, and exposing his youthful form to the dust, under the&#10;nearest house or fence.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Only then would the person who had given him the fright repent,&#10;and say with a laugh:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;God in heaven, what a stupid lad this is!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And, should that person have been asked why he had thus&#10;terrified the boy, he would probably have replied:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Because it is such sport to do so. As a lad who cannot feel&#10;things as other human beings do, he inclines folk to make fun of&#10;him.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As for the omniscient Antipa Vologonov, the following was his&#10;frequent comment on Nilushka:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Christ also had to walk in terror. Christ also was persecuted.&#10;Why so? Because ever He endured in rectitude and strength. Men need&#10;to learn what is real and what is unreal. Many are the sins of&#10;earth come of the fact that the seeming is mistaken for the actual,&#10;and that men keep pressing forward when they ought to be waiting,&#10;to be proving themselves.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Hence Vologonov, like the rest, bestowed much attention upon&#10;Nilushka, and frequently held conversations with him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Do you now pray to God,&#34; he said once as he pointed to heaven&#10;with one of his crooked fingers, and with the disengaged hand&#10;clasped his dishevelled, variously coloured beard.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Whereupon Nilushka glanced fearfully at the mysteriously&#10;pointing finger, and, plucking sharply at his forehead, shoulders,&#10;and stomach with two fingers and a thumb, intoned in thin,&#10;plaintive accents:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Our Father in Heaven&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;WHICH ART in Heaven.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, in the Heaven of Heavens.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ah, well! God will understand. He is the friend of all blessed&#10;ones.&#34; [Idiots; since persons mentally deficient are popularly&#10;deemed to stand in a peculiarly close relation to the&#10;Almighty.]&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Again, great was Nilushka&#39;s interest in anything spherical.&#10;Also, he had a love for handling the heads of children; when,&#10;softly approaching a group from behind, he would, with his bright,&#10;quiet smile, lay slender, bony fingers upon a close-cropped little&#10;poll; with the result that the children, not relishing such&#10;fingering, would take alarm at the same, and, bolting to a discreet&#10;distance, thence abuse the idiot, put out their tongues at him, and&#10;drawl in a nasal chorus:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Nilka, the bottle-neck, the neck without a nape to it&#34;&#10;[Probably the attractiveness of this formula lay rather in the&#10;rhyming of the Russian words: &#34;Nilka, butilka, bashka bez zatilka!&#34;&#10;than in their actual meaning].&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Yet their fear of him was in no way reciprocated, nor, for that&#10;matter, did they ever assault him, despite the fact that&#10;occasionally they would throw an old boot or a chip of wood in his&#10;direction-throw it aimlessly, and without really desiring to hit&#10;the mark aimed at.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Also, anything circular&#8212;for example, a plate or the wheel of a&#10;toy, engaged Nilushka&#39;s attention and led him to caress it as&#10;eagerly as he did globes and balls. Evidently the rotundity of the&#10;object was the point that excited his interest. And as he turned&#10;the object over and over, and felt the flat part of it, he would&#10;mutter:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But what about the other one?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;What &#34;the other one&#34; meant I could never divine. Nor could&#10;Antipa. Once, drawing the idiot to him, he said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why do you always say &#39;What about the other one&#39;?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Troubled and nervous, Nilushka merely muttered some&#10;unintelligible reply as his fingers turned and turned about the&#10;circular object which he was holding.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Nothing,&#34; at length he replied.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Nothing of what?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Nothing here.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ah, he is too foolish to understand,&#34; said Vologonov with a&#10;sigh as his eyes darkened in meditative fashion.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, though it may seem foolish to say so,&#34; he added, &#34;some&#10;people would envy him.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why should they?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;For more than one reason. To begin with, he lives a life free&#10;from care&#8212;he is kept comfortably, and even held in respect. Since&#10;no one can properly understand him, and everyone fears him, through&#10;a belief that folk without wit, the &#39;blessed ones of God,&#39; are more&#10;especially the Almighty&#39;s favourites than persons possessed of&#10;understanding. Only a very wise man could deal with such a matter,&#10;and the less so in that it must be remembered that more than one&#10;&#39;blessed one&#39; has become a Saint, while some of those possessed of&#10;understanding have gone&#8212;well, have gone whither? Yes, indeed!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And, thoughtfully contracting the bushy eyebrows which looked as&#10;though they had been taken from the face of another man, Vologonov&#10;thrust his hands up his sleeves, and stood eyeing Nilushka shrewdly&#10;with his intangible gaze.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Never did Felitzata say for certain who the boy&#39;s father had&#10;been, but at least it was known to me that in vague terms she had&#10;designated two men as such&#8212;the one a young &#34;survey student,&#34; and&#10;the other a merchant by name Viporotkov, a man notorious to the&#10;whole town as a most turbulent rake and bully. But once when she&#10;and Antipa and I were seated gossiping at the entrance-gates, and I&#10;inquired of her whether Nilushka&#39;s father were still surviving, she&#10;replied in a careless way:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;He is so, damn him!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Then who is he?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Felitzata, as usual, licked her faded, but still comely, lips&#10;with the tip of her tongue before she replied:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;A monk.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ah!&#34; Vologonov exclaimed with unexpected animation. &#34;That,&#10;then, explains things. At all events, we have in it an intelligible&#10;THEORY of things.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Whereafter, he expounded to us at length, and with no sparing of&#10;details, the reason why a monk should have been Nilushka&#39;s father&#10;rather than either the merchant or the young &#34;survey student.&#34; And&#10;as Vologonov proceeded he grew unwontedly enthusiastic, and went so&#10;far as to clench his fists until presently he heaved a sigh, as&#10;though mentally hurt, and said frowningly and reproachfully to the&#10;woman:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why did you never tell us this before? It was exceedingly&#10;negligent of you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Felitzata looked at the old man with sarcasm and sauciness&#10;gleaming in her brown eyes. Suddenly, however, she contracted her&#10;brows, counterfeited a sigh, and whined:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ah, I was good-looking then, and desired of all. In those days&#10;I had both a good heart and a happy nature.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But the monk may prove to have been an important factor in the&#10;question,&#34; was Antipa&#39;s thoughtful remark.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, and many another man than he has run after me for his&#10;pleasure,&#34; continued Felitzata in a tone of reminiscence. This led&#10;Vologonov to cough, rise to his feet, lay his hand upon the woman&#39;s&#10;claret-coloured sleeve of satin, and say sternly:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Do you come into my room, for I have business to transact with&#10;you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As she complied she smiled and winked at me. And so the pair&#10;departed&#8212;he shuffling carefully with his bandy legs, and she&#10;watching her steps as though at any moment she might collapse on to&#10;her left side.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Thenceforth, Felitzata visited Vologonov almost daily; and once&#10;during the time of two hours or so that the pair were occupied in&#10;drinking tea I heard, through the partition-wall, the old man say&#10;in vigorous, level, didactical tones:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;These tales and rumours ought not to be dismissed save with&#10;caution. At least ought they to be given the benefit of the doubt.&#10;For, though all that he says may SEEM to us unintelligible, there&#10;may yet be enshrined therein a meaning, such as&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You say a meaning?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, a meaning which, eventually, will be vouchsafed to you in&#10;a vision. For example, you may one day see issue from a dense&#10;forest a man of God, and hear him cry aloud: Felitzata, Oh servant&#10;of God, Oh sinner most dark of soul&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What a croaking, to be sure!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Be silent! No nonsense! Do you blame yourself rather than sing&#10;your own praises. And in that vision you may hear the man of God&#10;cry: &#39;Felitzata, go you forth and do that which one who shall meet&#10;you may request you to perform!&#39; And, having gone forth, you may&#10;find the man of God to be the monk whom we have spoken of.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;A-a-ah!&#34; the woman drawled with an air of being about to say&#10;something more.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Come, fool!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You see&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Have I, this time, abused you?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No, but&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I have an idea that the man of God will be holding a&#10;crook.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Of course,&#34; assented Felitzata.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Similarly, on another occasion, did I hear Antipa mutter&#10;confidentially to his companion:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The fact that all his sayings are so simple is not a favourable&#10;sign. For, you see, they do not harmonise with the affair in its&#10;entirety&#8212;in such a connection words should be mysterious, and so,&#10;able to be interpreted in more than one way, seeing that the more&#10;meanings words possess, the more are those words respected and&#10;heeded by mankind.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why so?&#34; queried Felitzata.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why so?&#34; re-echoed Vologonov irritably. &#34;Are we not, then, to&#10;respect ANYONE or ANYTHING? Only he is worthy of respect who does&#10;not harm his fellows; and of those who do not harm their fellows&#10;there are but few. To this point you must pay attention&#8212;you must&#10;teach him words of variable import, words more abstract, as well as&#10;more sonorous.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But I know no such words.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I will repeat to you a few, and every night, when he goes to&#10;bed, you shall repeat them to HIM. For example: &#39;Adom ispolneni,&#10;pokaites&#39;[Do ye people who are filled with venom repent]. And mark&#10;that the exact words of the Church be adhered to. For instance,&#10;&#39;Dushenbitzi, pozhaleite Boga, okayannie,&#39; [Murderers of the soul,&#10;accursed ones, repent ye before God.] must be said rather than&#10;&#39;Dushenbitzi, pozhaleite Boga, okayanni,&#39; since the latter, though&#10;the shorter form, is also not the correct one. But perhaps I had&#10;better instruct the lad myself.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Certainly that would be the better plan.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So from that time onwards Vologonov fell to stopping Nilushka in&#10;the street, and repeating to him something or another in his kindly&#10;fashion. Once he even took him by the hand, and, leading him to his&#10;room, and giving him something to cat, said persuasively:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Say this after me. &#39;Do not hasten, Oh ye people.&#39; Try if you&#10;can say that.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;&#39;A lantern,&#39;&#34; began Nilushka civilly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;&#39;A lantern?&#39; Yes. Well, go on, and say, &#39;I am a lantern unto&#10;thee&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I want to sing, it.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;There is no need for that, though presently you shall sing it.&#10;For the moment your task is to learn the correct speaking of&#10;things. So say after me&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O Lo-ord, have mercy!&#34; came in a quiet, thoughtful chant from&#10;the idiot. Whereafter he added in the coaxing tone of a child:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;We shall all of us have to die.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, but come, come!&#34; expostulated Vologonov. &#34;What are you&#10;blurting out NOW? That much I know without your telling me&#8212;always&#10;have I known, little friend, that each of us is hastening towards&#10;his death. Yet your want of understanding exceeds what should&#10;be.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Dogs run-&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Dogs? Now, enough, little fellow.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Dogs run like chickens. They run here, in the ravine,&#34;&#10;continued Nilushka in the murmuring accents of a child of&#10;three.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Nevertheless,&#34; mused Vologonov, &#34;even that seeming nothing of&#10;his may mean something. Yes, there may lie in it a great deal. Now,&#10;say: &#39;Perdition will arise before him who shall hasten.&#39;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No, I want to SING something.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With a splutter Vologonov said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Truly you are a difficult subject to deal with!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And with that he fell to pacing the floor with long, thoughtful&#10;strides as the idiot&#39;s voice cried in quavering accents:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O Lo-ord, have me-ercy upon us!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Thus the winsome Nilushka proved indispensable to the foul,&#10;mean, unhealthy life of the suburb. Of that life he coloured and&#10;rounded off the senselessness, the ugliness, the superfluity. He&#10;resembled an apple hanging forgotten on a gnarled old worm-eaten&#10;tree, whence all the fruit and the leaves have fallen until only&#10;the branches wave in the autumn wind. Rather, he resembled a&#10;sole-surviving picture in the pages of a ragged, soiled old book&#10;which has neither a beginning nor an ending, and therefore can no&#10;longer be read, is no longer worth the reading, since now its pages&#10;contain nothing intelligible.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And as smiling his gracious smile, the lad&#39;s pathetic, legendary&#10;figure flitted past the mouldy buts and cracked fences and riotous&#10;beds of nettles, there would readily recur to the memory, and&#10;succeed one another, visions of some of the finer and more&#10;reputable personages of Russian lore&#8212;there would file before one&#39;s&#10;mental vision, in endless sequence, men whose biographies inform us&#10;how, in fear for their souls, they left the life of the world, and,&#10;hieing them to the forests and the caves, abandoned mankind for the&#10;wild things of nature. And at the same time would there recur to&#10;one&#39;s memory poems concerning the blind and the poor-in particular,&#10;the poem concerning Alexei the Man of God, and all the multitude of&#10;other fair, but unsubstantial, forms wherein Russia has embodied&#10;her sad and terrified soul, her humble and protesting grief. Yet it&#10;was a process to depress one almost to the point of&#10;distraction.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Once, forgetting that Nilushka was imbecile, I conceived an&#10;irrepressible desire to talk with him, and to read him good poetry,&#10;and to tell him both of the world&#39;s youthful hopes and of my own&#10;personal thoughts.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The occasion happened on a day when, as I was sitting on the&#10;edge of the ravine, and dangling my legs over the ravine&#39;s depths,&#10;the lad came floating towards me as though on air. In his hands,&#10;with their fingers as slender as a girl&#39;s, he was holding a large&#10;leaf; and as he gazed at it the smile of his clear blue eyes was,&#10;as it were, pervading him from head to foot.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Whither, Nilushka?&#34; said I.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With a start he raised his head and eyes heavenward. Then&#10;timidly he glanced at the blue shadow of the ravine, and extended&#10;to me his leaf, over the veins of which there was crawling a&#10;ladybird.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;A bukan,&#34; he observed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It is so. And whither are you going to take it?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;We shall all of us die. I was going to take and bury it.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But it is alive; and one does not bury things before they are&#10;dead.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Nilushka closed and opened his eyes once or twice.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I should like to sing something,&#34; he remarked.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Rather, do you SAY something.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He glanced at the ravine again&#8212;his pink nostrils quivering and&#10;dilating&#8212;then sighed as though he was weary, and in all&#10;unconsciousness muttered a foul expression. As he did so I noticed&#10;that on the portion of his neck below his right ear there was a&#10;large birthmark, and that, covered with golden down like velvet,&#10;and resembling in shape a bee, it seemed to be endowed with a&#10;similitude of life, through the faint beating of a vein in its&#10;vicinity.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Presently the ladybird raised her upper wings as though she were&#10;preparing for flight; whereupon Nilushka sought with a finger to&#10;detain her, and, in so doing, let fall the leaf, and enabled the&#10;insect to detach itself and fly away at a low level. Upon that,&#10;bending forward with arms outstretched, the idiot went softly in&#10;pursuit, much as though he himself were launching his body into&#10;leisurely flight, but, when ten paces away, stopped, raised his&#10;face to heaven, and, with arms pendent before him, and the palms of&#10;his hands turned outwards as though resting on something which I&#10;could not see, remained fixed and motionless.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;From the ravine there were tending upwards towards the sunlight&#10;some green sprigs of willow, with dull yellow flowers and a clump&#10;of grey wormwood, while the damp cracks which seamed the clay of&#10;the ravine were lined with round leaves of the &#34;mother-stepmother&#10;plant,&#34; and round about us little birds were hovering, and from&#10;both the bushes and the bed of the ravine there was ascending the&#10;moist smell of decay. Yet over our heads the sky was clear, as the&#10;sun, now sole occupant of the heavens, declined slowly in the&#10;direction of the dark marshes across the river; only above the&#10;roofs of Zhitnaia Street could there be seen fluttering about in&#10;alarm a flock of snow-white pigeons, while waving below them was&#10;the black besom which had, as it were, swept them into the air, and&#10;from afar one could hear the sound of an angry murmur, the&#10;mournful, mysterious murmur of the town.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Whiningly, like an old man, a child of the suburb was raising&#10;its voice in lamentation; and as I listened to the sound, it put me&#10;in mind of a clerk reading Vespers amid the desolation of an empty&#10;church. Presently a brown dog passed us with shaggy head&#10;despondently pendent, and eyes as beautiful as those of a drunken&#10;woman.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And, to complete the picture, there was standing&#8212;outlined&#10;against the nearest shanty of the suburb, a shanty which lay at the&#10;extreme edge of the ravine-there was standing, face to the sun, and&#10;back to the town, as though preparing for flight, the straight,&#10;slender form of the boy who, while alien to all, caressed all with&#10;the eternally incomprehensible smile of his angel-like eyes. Yes,&#10;that golden birthmark so like a bee I can see to this day!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Two weeks later, on a Sunday at mid-day, Nilushka passed into&#10;the other world. That day, after returning home from late Mass, and&#10;handing to his mother a couple of wafers which had been given him&#10;as a mark of charity, the lad said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Mother, please lay out my bed on the chest, for I think that I&#10;am going to lie down for the last time.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Yet the words in no way surprised Felitzata, for he had often&#10;before remarked, before retiring to rest:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Some day we shall all of us have to die.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At the same time, whereas, on previous occasions, Nilushka had&#10;never gone to sleep without first of all singing to himself his&#10;little song, and then chanting the eternal, universal &#34;Lord, have&#10;mercy upon us!&#34; he, on this occasion, merely folded his hands upon&#10;his breast, closed his eyes, and relapsed into slumber.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;That day Felitzata had dinner, and then departed on business of&#10;her own; and when she returned in the evening, she was astonished&#10;to find that her son was still asleep. Next, on looking closer at&#10;him, she perceived that he was dead.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I looked,&#34; she related plaintively to some of the suburban&#10;residents who came running to her cot, &#34;and perceived his little&#10;feet to be blue; and since it was only just before Mass that I had&#10;washed his hands with soap, I remarked the more readily that his&#10;feet were become less white than his hands. And when I felt one of&#10;those hands, I found that it had stiffened.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;On Felitzata&#39;s face, as she recounted this, there was manifest a&#10;nervous expression. Likewise, her features were a trifle flushed.&#10;Yet gleaming also through the tears in her languorous eyes there&#10;was a sense of relief&#8212;one might almost have said a sense of&#10;joy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Next,&#34; continued she, &#34;I looked closer still, and then fell on&#10;my knees before the body, sobbing: &#39;Oh my darling, whither art thou&#10;fled? Oh God, wherefore hast Thou taken him from me?&#39;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Here Felitzata inclined her head upon her left shoulder&#10;contracted her brows over her mischievous eyes, clasped her hands&#10;to her breast, and fell into the lament:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p class=&#34;poem&#34;&#62;Oh, gone is my dove, my radiant moon!&#60;br /&#62;&#10;O star of mine eyes, thou hast set too soon!&#60;br /&#62;&#10;In darksome depths thy light lies drown&#39;d,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;And time must yet complete its round,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;And the trump of the Second Advent sound,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Ere ever my&#8212;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Here, you! Hold your tongue!&#34; grunted Vologonov irritably.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For myself, I had, that day, been walking in the forest, until,&#10;as I returned, I was brought up short before the windows of&#10;Felitzata&#39;s cot by the fact that some of the erstwhile turbulent&#10;denizens of the suburb were whispering softly together as, with an&#10;absence of all noise, they took turns to raise themselves on&#10;tiptoe, and, craning their necks, to peer into one of the black&#10;window-spaces. Yes, like bees on the step of a hive did they look,&#10;and on the great majority of faces, and in the great majority of&#10;eyes, there was quivering an air of tense, nervous expectancy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Only Vologonov was nudging Felitzata, and saying to her in a&#10;loud, authoritative tone:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Very ready are you to weep, but I should like first to hear the&#10;exact circumstances of the lad&#39;s death.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Thus invited, the woman wiped her eyes with the sleeve of her&#10;bodice, licked her lips, heaved a prolonged sigh, and fell to&#10;regarding Antipa&#39;s red, hardbitten face with the cheerful,&#10;unabashed glance of a person who is under the influence of liquor.&#10;From under her white head-band there had fallen over her temples&#10;and her right cheek a few wisps of golden hair; and indeed, as she&#10;drew herself up, and tossed her head and bosom, and smoothed out&#10;and stretched the creases in her bodice, she looked less than her&#10;years. Everyone now fell to eyeing her in an attentive silence,&#10;though not, it would seem, without a touch of envy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Abruptly, sternly, the old man inquired:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Did the lad ever complain of ill-health?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No, never,&#34; Felitzata replied. &#34;Never once did he speak of&#10;it&#8212;never once.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And he had not been beaten?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh, how can you ask me such a thing, and especially seeing&#10;that, that&#8212;?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I did not say beaten by YOU.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well, I cannot answer for anyone else, but at least had he no&#10;mark on his body, seeing that when I lifted the smock I could find&#10;nothing save for scratches on legs and back.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Her tone now had in it a new ring, a ring of increased&#10;assurance, and when she had finished she closed her bright eyes&#10;languidly before heaving a soft, as it were, voluptuous, and,&#10;withal, very audible sigh.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Someone here murmured:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;She DID use to beat him.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;At all events she used to lose her temper with him.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;This led to the putting of a further dozen or so of leading&#10;questions; whereafter Antipa, for a while, preserved a suggestive&#10;silence, and the crowd too remained silent, as though it had&#10;suddenly been lulled to slumber. Only at long last, and with a&#10;clearing of his throat, did Antipa say:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Friends, we must suppose that God, of His infinite Mercy, has&#10;vouchsafed to us here a special visitation, in that, as all of us&#10;have perceived, a lad bereft of wit, the same radiant lad whom all&#10;of us have known, has here abided in the closest of communion with&#10;the Blessed Dispenser of life on earth.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then I moved away, for upon my heart there was pressing a burden&#10;of unendurable sorrow, and I was yearning, oh, so terribly, to see&#10;Nilushka once more.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The back portion of Felitzata&#39;s cot stood a little sunken into&#10;the ground, so that the front portion had its cold window panes and&#10;raised sash tilted a trifle towards the remote heavens. I bent my&#10;head, and entered by the open door. Near the threshold Nilushka was&#10;lying on a narrow chest against the wall. The folds of a dark-red&#10;pillow of fustian under the head set off to perfection the pale&#10;blue tint of his round, innocent face under its corona of golden&#10;curls; and though the eyes were closed, and the lips pressed&#10;tightly together, he still seemed to be smiling in his old quiet,&#10;but joyous, way. In general, the tall, thin figure on the mattress&#10;of dark felt, with its bare legs, and its slender hands and wrists&#10;folded across the breast, reminded me less of an angel than of a&#10;certain image of the Holy Child with which a blackened old ikon had&#10;rendered me familiar from my boyhood upwards.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Everything amid the purple gloom was still. Even the flies were&#10;forbearing to buzz. Only from the street was there grating through&#10;the shaded window the strong, roguish voice of Felitzata as it&#10;traced the strange, lugubrious word-pattern:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p class=&#34;poem&#34;&#62;With my bosom pressed to the warm, grey&#10;earth,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;To thee, grey earth, to thee, Oh my mother of old,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;I beseech thee, I who am a mother like thee,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;And a mother in pain, to enfold in thy arms&#60;br /&#62;&#10;This my son, this my dead son, this my ruby,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;This my drop of my heart&#39;s blood, this my&#8212;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Suddenly I caught sight of Antipa standing in the doorway. He&#10;was wiping his eyes with the back of his hand. Presently in a gruff&#10;and unsteady voice he said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It is all very fine for you to weep, good woman, but the&#10;present is not the right moment to sing such verses as those&#8212;they&#10;were meant, rather, to be sung in a graveyard at the side of a&#10;tomb. Well, tell me everything without reserve. Important is it&#10;that I should know EVERYTHING.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Whereafter, having crossed himself with a faltering hand, he&#10;carefully scrutinised the corpse, and at last let his eyes halt&#10;upon the lad&#39;s sweet features. Then he muttered sadly:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;How extraordinarily he has grown! Yes, death has indeed&#10;enlarged him! Ah, well, so be it! Soon I too shall have to be&#10;stretching myself out. Oh that it were now!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then with cautious movements of his deformed fingers he&#10;straightened the folds of the lad&#39;s smock, and drew it over the&#10;legs. Whereafter he pressed his flushed lips to the hem of the&#10;garment.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Said I to him at that moment:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What is it that you have been wanting of him? Why is it that&#10;you have been trying to teach him strange words?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Straightening himself, and glancing at me with dim eyes, Antipa&#10;repeated:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What is it that I have been wanting of him?&#34; To the repetition&#10;he added with manifest sincerity, though also with a&#10;self-depreciatory movement of the head:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;To tell the truth, I scarcely know WHAT it is that I have been&#10;wanting of him. By God I do not. Yet, as one speaking the truth in&#10;the presence of death, I say that never during my long lifetime had&#10;I so desired aught else&#8230; . Yes, I have waited and waited for&#10;fortune to reveal it to me; and ever has fortune remained mute and&#10;tongueless. Foolish was it of me to have expected otherwise, to&#10;have expected, for instance, that some day there might occur&#10;something marvellous, something unlooked-for.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With a short laugh, he indicated the corpse with his eyes, and&#10;continued more firmly:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, bootless was it to have expected anything from such a&#10;source as that. Never, despite one&#39;s wishes, was anything possible&#10;of acquisition thence&#8230; This is usually the case. Felitzata, as a&#10;clever woman indeed (albeit one cold of heart), was for having her&#10;son accounted a God&#39;s fool, and thereby gaining some provision&#10;against her old age.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But you yourself were the person who suggested that? You&#10;yourself wished it?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Presently, thrusting his hands up his sleeves, he added dully&#10;and brokenly:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, I DID wish it. Why not, indeed, seeing that at least it&#10;would have brought comfort to the poor people of this place?&#10;Sometimes I feel very sorry for them with their bitter, troublous&#10;lives&#8212;lives which may be the lives of rogues and villains, yet are&#10;lives which have produced amongst us a pravednik,&#34; [A &#34;just&#10;person,&#34; a human being without sin].&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;All the evening sky was now aflame. Upon the ear there fell the&#10;mournful lament:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When snow has veiled the earth in white, The snowy plain the&#10;wild wolves tread. They wail for the cheering warmth of spring As I&#10;bewail the bairn that&#39;s dead.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Vologonov listened for a moment. Then he said firmly:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;These are mere accesses of impulse which come upon her. And&#10;that is only what might be expected. Even as in song or in vice&#10;there is no holding her, so remorse, when it has fastened upon such&#10;a woman&#39;s heart, will know no bounds. I may tell you that on one&#10;occasion two young merchants took her, stripped her stark naked,&#10;and drove her in their carriage down Zhitnaia Street, with&#10;themselves sitting on the seats of the vehicle, and Felitzata&#10;standing upright between them&#8212;yes, in a state of nudity! Thereafter&#10;they beat her almost to death.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As I stepped out into the dark, narrow vestibule, Antipa, who&#10;was following me, muttered:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Such a lament as hers could come only of genuine grief.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;We found Felitzata in front of the hut, with her back covering&#10;the window. There, with hands pressed to her bosom, and her skirt&#10;all awry, she was straining her dishevelled head towards the&#10;heavens, while the evening breeze, stirring her fine auburn hair,&#10;scattered it promiscuously over her flushed, sharply-defined&#10;features and wildly protruding eyes. A bizarre, pitiable, and&#10;extraordinary figure did she cut as she wailed in a throaty voice&#10;which constantly gathered strength:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Oh winds of ice, winds cruel and rude, Press on my heart till&#10;its throbbings fail! Arrest the current of my blood! Turn these hot&#10;melting tears to hail!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Before her there was posted a knot of women, compassionate&#10;contemplators of the singer&#39;s distracted, grief-wrought features.&#10;Through the ravine&#39;s dark opening I could see the sun sinking below&#10;the suburb before plunging into the marshy forest and having his&#10;disk pierced by sharp, black tips of pine trees. Already everything&#10;around him was red. Already, seemingly, he had been wounded, and&#10;was bleeding to death.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 19, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/3920')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('The Cemetery'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;In a town of the steppes where I found life exceedingly dull,&#10;the best and the brightest spot was the cemetery. Often did I use&#10;to walk there, and once it happened that I fell asleep on some&#10;thick, rich, sweet-smelling grass in a cradle-like hollow between&#10;two tombs.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;From that sleep I was awakened with the sound of blows being&#10;struck against the ground near my head. The concussion of them&#10;jarred me not a little, as the earth quivered and tinkled like a&#10;bell. Raising myself to a sitting posture, I found sleep still so&#10;heavy upon me that at first my eyes remained blinded with&#10;unfathomable darkness, and could not discern what the matter was.&#10;The only thing that I could see amid the golden glare of the June&#10;sunlight was a wavering blur which at intervals seemed to adhere to&#10;a grey cross, and to make it give forth a succession of soft&#10;creaks.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Presently, however&#8212;against my wish, indeed&#8212;that wavering blur&#10;resolved itself into a little, elderly man. Sharp-featured, with a&#10;thick, silvery tuft of hair beneath his under lip, and a bushy&#10;white moustache curled in military fashion, on his upper, he was&#10;using the cross as a means of support as, with his disengaged hand&#10;outstretched, and sawing the air, he dug his foot repeatedly into&#10;the ground, and, as he did so, bestowed upon me sundry dry, covert&#10;glances from the depths of a pair of dark eyes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What have you got there?&#34; I inquired.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;A snake,&#34; he replied in an educated bass voice, and with a&#10;rugged forefinger he pointed downwards; whereupon I perceived that&#10;wriggling on the path at his feet and convulsively whisking its&#10;tail, there was an echidna.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh, it is only a grassworm,&#34; I said vexedly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The old man pushed away the dull, iridescent, rope-like thing&#10;with the toe of his boot, raised a straw hat in salute, and strode&#10;firmly onwards.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I thank you,&#34; I called out; whereupon, he replied without&#10;looking behind him:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;If the thing really WAS a grassworm, of course there was no&#10;danger.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then he disappeared among the tombstones.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Looking at the sky, I perceived the time to be about five&#10;o&#39;clock.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The steppe wind was sighing over the tombs, and causing long&#10;stems of grass to rock to and fro, and freighting the heated air&#10;with the silken rustling of birches and limes and other trees, and&#10;leading one to detect amid the humming of summer a note of quiet&#10;grief eminently calculated to evoke lofty, direct thoughts&#10;concerning life and one&#39;s fellow-men.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Veiling with greenery, grey and white tombstones worn with the&#10;snows of winter, crosses streaked with marks of rain, and the wall&#10;with which the graveyard was encircled, the rank vegetation served&#10;to also conceal the propinquity of a slovenly, clamorous town which&#10;lay coated with rich, sooty grime amid an atmosphere of dust and&#10;smells.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As I set off for a ramble among the tombs and tangled grass, I&#10;could discern through openings in the curtain of verdure a belfry&#39;s&#10;gilded cross which reared itself solemnly over crosses and&#10;memorials. At the foot of those memorials the sacramental vestment&#10;of the cemetery was studded with a kaleidoscopic sheen of flowers&#10;over which bees and wasps were so hovering and humming that the&#10;grass&#39;s sad, prayerful murmur seemed charged with a song of life&#10;which yet did not hinder reflections on death. Fluttering above me&#10;on noiseless wing were birds the flight of which sometimes made me&#10;start, and stand wondering whether the object before my gaze was&#10;really a bird or not: and everywhere the shimmer of gilded sunlight&#10;was setting the close-packed graveyard in a quiver which made the&#10;mounds of its tombs reminiscent of a sea when, after a storm, the&#10;wind has fallen, and all the green level is an expanse of smooth,&#10;foamless billows.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Beyond the wall of the cemetery the blue void of the firmament&#10;was pierced with smoky chimneys of oil-mills and soap factories,&#10;the roofs of which showed up like particoloured stains against the&#10;darker rags and tatters of other buildings; while blinking in the&#10;sunlight I could discern clatter-emitting, windows which looked to&#10;me like watchful eyes. Only on the nearer side of the wall was a&#10;sparse strip of turf dotted over with ragged, withered, tremulous&#10;stems, and beyond this, again, lay the site of a burnt building&#10;which constituted a black patch of earth-heaps, broken stoves, dull&#10;grey ashes, and coal dust. To heaven gaped the black, noisome&#10;mouths of burning-pits wherein the more economical citizens were&#10;accustomed nightly to get rid of the contents of their dustbins.&#10;Among the tall stems of steppe grass waved large, glossy leaves of&#10;ergot; in the sunlight splinters of broken glass sparkled as though&#10;they were laughing; and, from two spots in the dark brown plot&#10;which formed a semicircle around the cemetery, there projected,&#10;like teeth, two buildings the new yellow paint of which&#10;nevertheless made them look mean and petty amid the tangle of&#10;rubbish, pigweed, groundsel, and dock.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Indolently roaming hither and thither, a few speckled hens&#10;resembled female pedlars, and some pompous red cockerels a troupe&#10;of firemen; in the orifices of the burning-pits a number of&#10;mournful-eyed, homeless dogs were lying sheltered; among the shoots&#10;of the steppe scrub some lean cats were stalking sparrows; and a&#10;band of children who were playing hide-and-seek among the orifices&#10;above-mentioned presented, a pitiful sight as they went skipping&#10;over the filthy earth, disappearing in the crevices among the piles&#10;of heaped-up dirt.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Beyond the site of the burnt-out building there stretched a&#10;series of mean, close-packed huts which, crammed exclusively with&#10;needy folk, stood staring, with their dim, humble eyes of windows,&#10;at the crumbling bricks of the cemetery wall, and the dense mass of&#10;trees which that wall enclosed. Here, in one such hut, had I myself&#10;a lodging in a diminutive attic, which not only smelt of lamp-oil,&#10;but stood in a position to have wafted to it the least gasp or&#10;ejaculation on the part of my landlord, Iraklei Virubov, a clerk in&#10;the local treasury. In short, I could never glance out of the&#10;window at the cemetery on the other side of the strip of dead,&#10;burnt, polluted earth without reflecting that, by comparison, that&#10;cemetery was a place of sheer beauty, a place of ceaseless&#10;attraction.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And ever, that day, as though he had been following me, could&#10;there be sighted among the tombs the dark figure of the old man who&#10;had so abruptly awakened me from slumber; and since his straw hat&#10;reflected the sunlight as brilliantly as the disk of a sunflower as&#10;it meandered hither and thither, I, in my turn, found myself&#10;following him, though thinking, all the while, of Iraklei Virubov.&#10;Only a week was it since Iraklei&#39;s wife, a thin, shrewish,&#10;long-nosed woman with green and catlike eyes, had set forth on a&#10;pilgrimage to Kiev, and Iraklei had hastened to import into the hut&#10;a stout, squint-eyed damsel whom he had introduced to me as his&#10;&#34;niece by marriage.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;She was baptised Evdokia,&#34; he had said on the occasion referred&#10;to. &#34;Usually, however, I call her Dikanka. Pray be friendly with&#10;her, but remember, also, that she is not a person with whom to take&#10;liberties.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Large, round-shouldered, and clean-shaven like a chef, Virubov&#10;was for ever hitching up breeches which had slipped from a stomach&#10;ruined with surfeits of watermelon. And always were his fat lips&#10;parted as though athirst, and perpetually had he in his colourless&#10;eyes an expression of insatiable hunger.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;One evening I overheard a dialogue to the following effect.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Dikanka, pray come and scratch my back. Yes, between the&#10;shoulder-blades. O-o-oh, that is it. My word, how strong you&#10;are!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Whereat Dikanka had laughed shrilly. And only when I had moved&#10;my chair, and thrown down my book, had the laughter and unctuous&#10;whispering died away, and given place to a whisper of:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Holy Father Nicholas, pray for us unto God! Is the supper kvas&#10;ready, Dikanka?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And softly the pair had departed to the kitchen&#8212;there to grunt&#10;and squeal once more like a couple of pigs&#8230; .&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The old man with the grey moustache stepped over the turf with&#10;the elastic stride of youth, until at length he halted before a&#10;large monument in drab granite, and stood reading the inscription&#10;thereon. Featured not altogether in accordance with the Russian&#10;type, he had on a dark-blue jacket, a turned-down collar, and a&#10;black stock finished off with a large bow&#8212;the latter contrasting&#10;agreeably with the thick, silvery, as it were molten, chin-tuft.&#10;Also, from the centre of a fierce moustache there projected a long&#10;and gristly nose, while over the grey skin of his cheeks there ran&#10;a network of small red veins. In the act of raising his hand to his&#10;hat (presumably for the purpose of saluting the dead), he, after&#10;conning the dark letters of the inscription on the tomb, turned a&#10;sidelong eye upon myself; and since I found the fact embarrassing,&#10;I frowned, and passed onward, full, still, of thoughts of the&#10;street where I was residing and where I desired to fathom the mean&#10;existence eked out by Virubov and his &#34;niece.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As usual, the tombs were also being patrolled by Pimesha,&#10;otherwise Pimen Krozootov, a bibulous, broken-down ex-merchant who&#10;used to spend his time in stumbling and falling about the graves in&#10;search of the supposed resting-place of his wife. Bent of body,&#10;Pimesha had a small, bird-like face over-grown with grey down, the&#10;eyes of a sick rabbit, and, in general, the appearance of having&#10;undergone a chewing by a set of sharp teeth. For the past three&#10;years he had thus been roaming the cemetery, though his legs were&#10;too weak to support his undersized, shattered body; and whenever he&#10;caught his foot he fell, and for long could not rise, but lay&#10;gasping and fumbling among the grass, and rooting it up, and&#10;sniffing with a nose as sharp and red as though the skin had been&#10;flayed from it. True, his wife had been buried at Novotchevkassk, a&#10;thousand versts away, but Pimen refused to credit the fact, and&#10;always, on being told it, stuttered with much blinking of his wet,&#10;faded eyes: &#34;Natasha? Natasha is here.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Also, there used to visit the spot, well-nigh daily, a Madame&#10;Christoforov, a tall old lady who, wearing black spectacles and a&#10;plain grey, shroudlike dress that was trimmed with black velvet,&#10;never failed to have a stick between her abnormally long fingers.&#10;Wizened of face, with cheeks hanging down like bags, and a knot of&#10;grey, rather, grey-green, hair combed over her temples from under a&#10;lace scarf, and almost concealing her ears, this lady pursued her&#10;way with deliberation, and entire assurance, and yielded the path&#10;to no one whom she might encounter. I have an idea that there lay&#10;buried there a son who had been killed in a roisterers&#39; brawl.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Another habitual visitor was thin-legged, short-sighted Aulic&#10;Councillor Praotzev, ex-schoolmaster. With a book stuffed into the&#10;pocket of his canvas pea-jacket, a white umbrella grasped in his&#10;red hand, and a smile extending to ears as sharp and pointed as a&#10;rabbit&#39;s, he could, any Sunday after dinner, be seen skipping from&#10;tomb to tomb, with his umbrella brandished like a white flag&#10;soliciting terms of peace with death.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And, on returning home before the bell rang for Vespers, he&#10;would find that a crowd of boys had collected outside his garden&#10;wall; whereupon, dancing about him like puppies around a stork,&#10;they would fall to shouting in various merry keys:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The Councillor, the Councillor! Who was it that fell in love&#10;with Madame Sukhinikh, and then fell into the pond?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Losing his temper, and opening a great mouth, until he looked&#10;like an old rook which is about to caw, the Councillor would stamp&#10;his foot several times, as though preparing to dance to the boys&#39;&#10;shouting, and lower his head, grasp his umbrella like a bayonet,&#10;and charge at the lads with a panting shout of:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I&#39;ll tell your fathers! Oh, I&#39;ll tell your mothers!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As for the Madame Sukhinikh, referred to, she was an old&#10;beggar-woman who, the year round, and in all weathers, sat on a&#10;little bench beside the cemetery wicket, and stuck to it like a&#10;stone. Her large face, a face rendered bricklike by years of&#10;inebriety, was covered with dark blotches born of frostbite,&#10;alcoholic inflammation, sunburn, and exposure to wind, and her eyes&#10;were perpetually in a state of suppuration. Never did anyone pass&#10;her but she proffered a wooden cup in a suppliant hand, and cried&#10;hoarsely, rather as though she were cursing the person&#10;concerned:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Give something for Christ&#39;s sake! Give in memory of your&#10;kinsfolk there!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Once an unexpected storm blew in from the steppes, and brought a&#10;downpour which, overtaking the old woman on her way home, caused&#10;her, her sight being poor, to fall into a pond, whence Praotzev&#10;attempted to rescue her, and into which, in the end, he slipped&#10;himself. From that day onwards he was twitted on the subject by the&#10;boys of the town.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Other frequenters of the cemetery I see before me&#8212;dark, silent&#10;figures, figures of persons whom still unsevered cords of memory&#10;seemed to have bound to the place for the rest of their lives, and&#10;compelled to wander, like unburied corpses, in quest of suitable&#10;tombs. Yes, they were persons whom life had rejected, and death, as&#10;yet, refused to accept.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Also, at times there would emerge from the long grass a homeless&#10;dog with large, sullen eyes, eyes startling at once in their&#10;intelligence and in their absolute Ishmaelitism&#8212;until one almost&#10;expected to hear issue from the animal&#39;s mouth reproaches couched&#10;in human language.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And sometimes the dog would still remain halted in the cemetery&#10;as, with tail lowered, it swayed its shelterless, shaggy head to&#10;and fro with an air of profound reflection, while occasionally&#10;venting a subdued, long-drawn yelp or howl.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Again, among the dense old lime trees, there would be scurrying&#10;an unseen mob of starlings and jackdaws whose young would,&#10;meanwhile, maintain a soft, hungry piping, a sort of gently&#10;persuasive, chirruping chorus; until in autumn, when the wind had&#10;stripped bare the boughs, these birds&#39; black nests would come to&#10;look like mouldy, rag-swathed heads of human beings which someone&#10;had torn from their bodies and flung into the trees, to hang for&#10;ever around the white, sugarloaf-shaped church of the martyred St.&#10;Barbara. During that autumn season, indeed, everything in the&#10;cemetery&#39;s vicinity looked sad and tarnished, and the wind would&#10;wail about the place, and sigh like a lover who has been driven mad&#10;through bereavement&#8230; .&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Suddenly the old man halted before me on the path, and, sternly&#10;extending a hand towards a white stone monument near us, read&#10;aloud:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;&#39;Under this cross there lies buried the body of the respected&#10;citizen and servant of God, Diomid Petrovitch Ussov,&#39;&#34; etc.,&#10;etc.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Whereafter the old man replaced his hat, thrust his hands into&#10;the pockets of his pea-jacket, measured me with eyes dark in&#10;colour, but exceptionally clear for his time of life, and said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It would seem that folk could find nothing to say of this man&#10;beyond that he was a &#39;servant of God.&#39; Now, how can a servant be&#10;worthy of honour at the hand of &#39;citizens&#39;?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Possibly he was an ascetic,&#34; was my hazarded conjecture;&#10;whereupon the old man rejoined with a stamp of his foot:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Then in such case one ought to write&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;To write what?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;To write EVERYTHING, in fullest possible detail.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And with the long, firm stride of a soldier my interlocutor&#10;passed onwards towards a more remote portion of the cemetery&#8212;myself&#10;walking, this time, beside him. His stature placed his head on a&#10;level with my shoulder only, and caused his straw hat to conceal&#10;his features. Hence, since I wished to look at him as he&#10;discoursed, I found myself forced to walk with head bent, as though&#10;I had been escorting a woman.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No, that is not the way to do it,&#34; presently he continued in&#10;the soft, civil voice of one who has a complaint to present. &#34;Any&#10;such proceeding is merely a mark of barbarism&#8212;of a complete lack of&#10;observation of men and life.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With a hand taken from one of his pockets, he traced a large&#10;circle in the air.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Do you know the meaning of that?&#34; he inquired.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Its meaning is death,&#34; was my diffident reply, made with a&#10;shrug of the shoulders.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A shake of his head disclosed to me a keen, agreeable, finely&#10;cut face as he pronounced the following Slavonic words:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;&#39;Smertu smert vsekonechnie pogublena bwist.&#39;&#34; [Death hath been&#10;for ever overthrown by death.&#34;]&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Do you know that passage?&#34; he added presently.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Yet it was in silence that we walked the next ten paces&#8212;he&#10;threading his way along the rough, grassy path at considerable&#10;speed. Suddenly he halted, raised his hat from his head, and&#10;proffered me a hand.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Young man,&#34; he said, &#34;let us make one another&#39;s better&#10;acquaintance. I am Lieutenant Savva Yaloylev Khorvat, formerly of&#10;the State Remount Establishment, subsequently of the Department of&#10;Imperial Lands. I am a man who, after never having been found&#10;officially remiss, am living in honourable retirement&#8212;a man at once&#10;a householder, a widower, and a person of hasty temper.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then, after a pause, he added:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Vice-Governor Khorvat of Tambov is my brother&#8212;a younger&#10;brother; he being fifty-five, and I sixty-one, si-i-ixty one.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;His speech was rapid, but as precise as though no mistake was&#10;permissible in its delivery.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Also,&#34; he continued, &#34;as a man cognisant of every possible&#10;species of cemetery, I am much dissatisfied with this one. In fact,&#10;never satisfied with such places am I.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Here he brandished his fist in the air, and described a large&#10;arc over the crosses.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Let us sit down,&#34; he said, &#34;and I will explain things.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So, after that we had seated ourselves on a bench beside a white&#10;oratory, and Lieutenant Khorvat had taken off his hat, and with a&#10;blue handkerchief wiped his forehead and the thick silvery hair&#10;which bristled from the knobs of his scalp, he continued:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Mark you well the word kladbistche.&#34; [The word, though&#10;customarily used for cemetery, means, primarily, a treasure-house.]&#10;Here he nudged me with his elbow&#8212;continuing, thereafter, more&#10;softly: &#34;In a kladbisiche one might reasonably look for kladi, for&#10;treasures of intellect and enlightenment. Yet what do we find? Only&#10;that which is offensive and insulting. All of us does it insult,&#10;for thereby is an insult paid to all who, in life, are bearing&#10;still their &#39;cross and burden.&#39; You too will, one day, be insulted&#10;by the system, even as shall I. Do you understand? I repeat, &#39;their&#10;cross and burden&#39;&#8212;the sense of the words being that, life being&#10;hard and difficult, we ought to honour none but those who STILL are&#10;bearing their trials, or bearing trials for you and me. Now, THESE&#10;folk here have ceased to possess consciousness.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Each time that the old man waved his hat in his excitement, its&#10;small shadow, bird-like, flew along the narrow path, and over the&#10;cross, and, finally, disappeared in the direction of the town.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Next, distending his ruddy cheeks, twitching his moustache, and&#10;regarding me covertly out of boylike eyes, the Lieutenant&#10;resumed:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Probably you are thinking, &#39;The man with whom I have to deal is&#10;old and half-witted.&#39; But no, young fellow; that is not so, for&#10;long before YOUR time had I taken the measure of life. Regard these&#10;memorials. ARE they memorials? For what do they commemorate as&#10;concerns you and myself? They commemorate, in that respect,&#10;nothing. No, they are not memorials; they are merely passports or&#10;testimonials conferred upon itself by human stupidity. Under a&#10;given cross there may lie a Maria, and under another one a Daria,&#10;or an Alexei, or an Evsei, or someone else&#8212;all &#39;servants of God,&#39;&#10;but not otherwise particularised. An outrage this, sir! For in this&#10;place folk who have lived their difficult portion of life on earth&#10;are seen robbed of that record of their existences, which ought to&#10;have been preserved for your and my instruction. Yes, A DESCRIPTION&#10;OF THE LIFE LIVED BY A MAN is what matters. A tomb might then&#10;become even more interesting than a novel. Do you follow me?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Not altogether,&#34; I rejoined.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He heaved a very audible sigh.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It should be easy enough,&#34; was his remark. &#34;To begin with, I am&#10;NOT a &#39;servant of God.&#39; Rather, I am a man intelligently, of set&#10;purpose, keeping God&#39;s holy commandments so far as lies within my&#10;power. And no one, not even God, has any right to demand of me more&#10;than I can give. That is so, is it not?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I nodded.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;There!&#34; the Lieutenant cried briskly as, cocking his hat, he&#10;assumed a still more truculent air. Then, spreading out his hands,&#10;he growled in his flexible bass:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What is this cemetery? It is merely a place of show.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At this moment, for some reason or another, there occurred to me&#10;an incident which involved the figure of Iraklei Virubov, the&#10;figure which had carpet slippers on its ponderous feet, thick lips,&#10;a greedy mouth, deceitful eyes, and a frame so huge and cavernous&#10;that the dapper little Lieutenant could have stepped into it&#10;complete.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The day had been a Sunday, and the hour eventide. On the burnt&#10;plot of ground some broken glass had been emitting a reddish gleam,&#10;shoots of ergot had been diffusing their gloss, children shouting&#10;at play, dogs trotting backwards and forwards, and all things,&#10;seemingly, faring well, sunken in the stillness of the portion of&#10;the town adjoining the rolling, vacant steppe, with, above them,&#10;only the sky&#39;s level, dull-blue canopy, and around them, only the&#10;cemetery, like an island amidst a sea.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With Virubov, I had been sitting on a bench near the wicket-gate&#10;of his hut, as intermittently he had screwed his lecherous eyes in&#10;the direction of the stout, ox-eyed lacemaker, Madame Ezhov, who,&#10;after disposing of her form on a bank hard-by, had fallen to&#10;picking lice out of the curls of her eight-year-old Petka&#10;Koshkodav. Presently, as swiftly she had rummaged the boy&#39;s hair&#10;with fingers grown used to such rapid movement, she had said to her&#10;husband (a dealer in second-hand articles), who had been seated&#10;within doors, and therefore rendered invisible&#8212;she had said with&#10;oily derision:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh, yes, you bald-headed old devil, you! Of course you got your&#10;price. Ye-es. Then, fool, you ought to have had a slipper smacked&#10;across that Kalmuck snout of yours. Talk of my price, indeed!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Upon this Virubov had remarked with a sigh, and in sluggish,&#10;sententious tones:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;To grant the serfs emancipation was a sheer mistake. I am a&#10;humble enough servant of my country, yet I can see the truth of&#10;what I have stated, since it follows as a matter of course. What&#10;ought to have been done is that all the estates of the landowners&#10;should have been conveyed to the Tsar. Beyond a doubt that is so.&#10;Then both the peasantry and the townsfolk, the whole people, in&#10;short, would have had but a single landlord. For never can the&#10;people live properly so long as it is ignorant of the point where&#10;it stands; and since it loves authority, it loves to have over it&#10;an autocratic force, for its control. Always can it be seen seeking&#10;such a force.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then, bending forward, and infusing into each softly uttered&#10;word a perfect lusciousness of falsity, Virubov had added to his&#10;neighbour:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Take, for example, the working-woman who stands free of every&#10;tie.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;How do I stand free of anything?&#34; the neighbour had retorted,&#10;in complete readiness for a quarrel.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh, I am not speaking in your despite, Pavlushka, but to your&#10;credit,&#34; hastily Virubov had protested.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Then keep your blandishments for that heifer, your &#39;niece,&#39;&#34;&#10;had been Madame Ezhov&#39;s response.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Upon this Virubov had risen heavily, and remarked as he moved&#10;away towards the courtyard:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;All folk need to be supervised by an autocratic eye.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Thereafter had followed a bout of choice abuse between his&#10;neighbour and his &#34;niece,&#34; while Virubov himself, framed in the&#10;wicket-gate, and listening to the contest, had smacked his lips as&#10;he gazed at the pair, and particularly at Madame Ezhov. At the&#10;beginning of the bout Dikanka had screeched:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It is my opinion, it is my opinion, that&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Don&#39;t treat me to any of YOUR slop!&#34; the long-fanged Pavla had&#10;interrupted for the benefit of the street in general. And thus had&#10;the affair continued&#8230; .&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Lieutenant Khorvat blew the fag-end of his cigarette from his&#10;mouthpiece, glanced at me, and said with seemingly, a not&#10;over-civil, twitch of his bushy moustache:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Of what are you thinking, if I might inquire?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I am trying to understand you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You ought not to find that difficult,&#34; was his rejoinder as&#10;again he doffed his hat, and fanned his face with it. &#34;The whole&#10;thing may be summed up in two words. It is that we lack respect&#10;both for ourselves and for our fellow men. Do you follow me&#10;NOW?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;His eyes had grown once more young and clear, and, seizing my&#10;hand in his strong and agreeably warm fingers, he continued:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why so? For the very simple reason that I cannot respect myself&#10;when I can learn nothing, simply nothing, about my fellows.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Moving nearer to me, he added in a mysterious undertone:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;In this Russia of ours none of us really knows why he has come&#10;into existence. True, each of us knows that he was born, and that&#10;he is alive, and that one day he will die; but which of us knows&#10;the reason why all that is so?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Through renewed excitement, its colour had come back to the&#10;Lieutenant&#39;s face, and his gestures became so rapid as to cause the&#10;ring on his finger to flash through the air like the link of a&#10;chain. Also, I was able to detect the fact that on the small, neat&#10;wrist under his left cuff, there was a bracelet finished with a&#10;medallion.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;All this, my good sir, is because (partially through the fact&#10;that men forget the point, and partially through the fact that that&#10;point fails to be understood aright) the WORK done by a man is&#10;concealed from our knowledge. For my own part, I have an idea, a&#10;scheme&#8212;yes, a scheme&#8212;in two words, a, a&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;N-n-o-u, n-n-o-u!&#34; the bell of the monastery tolled over the&#10;tombs in languid, chilly accents.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;&#8212;a scheme that every town and every village, in fact, every&#10;unit of homogeneous population, should keep a record of the&#10;particular unit&#39;s affairs, a, so to speak, &#39;book of life.&#39; This&#10;&#39;book of life&#39; should be more than a list of the results of the&#10;unit&#39;s labour; it should also be a living narrative of the workaday&#10;activities accomplished by each member of the unit. Eh? And, of&#10;course, the record to be compiled without official&#10;interference&#8212;solely by the town council or district administration,&#10;or by a special &#39;board, of life and works&#39; or some such body,&#10;provided only that the task be not carried out by nominees of the&#10;GOVERNMENT. And in that record there should be entered&#10;everything&#8212;that is to say, everything of a nature which ought to be&#10;made public concerning every man who has lived among us, and has&#10;since gone from our midst.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Here the Lieutenant stretched out his hand again in the&#10;direction of the tombs.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My right it is,&#34; he added, &#34;to know how those folk there spent&#10;their lives. For it is by their labours and their thoughts, and&#10;even on the product of their bones, that I myself am now&#10;subsisting. You agree, do you not?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In silence I nodded; whereupon he cried triumphantly:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ah! You see, do you? Yes, an indispensable point is it, that&#10;whatsoever a man may have done, whether good or evil, should be&#10;recorded. For example, suppose he has manufactured a stove&#10;specially good for heating purposes; record the fact. Or suppose he&#10;has killed a mad dog; record the fact. Or suppose he has built a&#10;school, or cleansed a dirty street, or been a pioneer in the&#10;teaching of sound farming, or striven, by word and deed, his life&#10;long, to combat official irregularities&#8230; record the fact. Again,&#10;suppose a woman has borne ten, or fifteen, healthy children; record&#10;the fact. Yes, and this last with particular care, since the&#10;conferment of healthy children upon the country is a work of&#10;absolute importance.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Further, pointing to a grey headstone with a worn inscription,&#10;he shouted (or almost did so):&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Under that stone lies buried the body of a man who never in his&#10;life loved but one woman, but ONE woman. Now, THAT is a fact which&#10;ought to have been recorded about him for it is not merely a string&#10;of names that is wanted, but a narrative of deeds. Yes, I have not&#10;only a desire, but a RIGHT, to know the lives which men have lived,&#10;and the works which they have performed; and whenever a man leaves&#10;our midst we ought to inscribe over his tomb full particulars of&#10;the &#39;cross and burden&#39; which he bore, as particulars ever to be&#10;held in remembrance, and inscribed there both for my benefit and&#10;for the benefit of life in general, as constituting a clear and&#10;circumstantial record of the given career. Why did that man live?&#10;To the question write down, always, the answer in large and&#10;conspicuous characters. Eh?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Most certainly.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;This led the Lieutenant&#39;s enthusiasm to increase still more as,&#10;for the third time waving his hand in the direction of the tombs,&#10;and mouthing each word, he continued:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The folk of that town are liars pure and simple, for of set&#10;purpose they conceal the particulars of careers that they may&#10;depreciate those careers in our eyes, and, while showing us the&#10;insignificance of the dead, fill the living with a sense of similar&#10;insignificance, since insignificant folk are the easiest to manage.&#10;Yes, it is a scheme thought out with diabolical ingenuity. Yet, for&#10;myself&#8212;well, try and make me do what I don&#39;t intend to do!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;To which, with his face wrinkled with disgust, he added in a&#10;tone like a shot from a pistol:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Machines are we! Yes, machines, and nothing else!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Curious was it to watch the old man&#39;s excitement as one listened&#10;to the strong bass voice amid the stillness of the cemetery. Once&#10;more over the tombs, there came floating the languid, metallic&#10;notes of &#34;N-n-o-u! N-n-o-u!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The oily gloss on the withered grass had vanished, faded, and&#10;everything turned dull, though the air remained charged with the&#10;spring perfume of the geraniums, stocks, and narcissi which&#10;encircled some of the graves.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You see,&#34; continued the Lieutenant, &#34;one could not deny that&#10;each of us has his value. By the time that one has lived threescore&#10;years, one perceives that fact very clearly. Never CONCEAL things,&#10;since every life lived ought to be set in the light. And is capable&#10;of being so, in that every man is a workman for the world at large,&#10;and constitutes an instructor in good or in evil, and that life,&#10;when looked into, constitutes, as a whole, the sum of all the&#10;labour done by the aggregate of us petty, insignificant&#10;individuals. That is why we ought not to hide away a man&#39;s work,&#10;but to publish it abroad, and to inscribe on the cross over his&#10;tomb his deeds, his services, in their entirety. Yes, however&#10;negligible may have been those deeds, those services, hold them up&#10;for the perusal of those who can discover good even in what is&#10;negligible. NOW do you understand me?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I do,&#34; I replied. &#34;Yes, I do.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Good!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The bell of the monastery struck two hasty beats&#8212;then became&#10;silent, so that only the sad echo of its voice remained&#10;reverberating over the cemetery. Once more my interlocutor drew out&#10;his cigarette-case, silently offered it to myself, and lighted and&#10;puffed industriously at another cigarette. As he did so his hands,&#10;as small and brown as the claws of a bird, shook a little, and his&#10;head, bent down, looked like an Easter egg in plush.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Still smoking, he looked me in the eyes with a self-diffident&#10;frown, and muttered:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Only through the labour of man does the earth attain&#10;development. And only by familiarising himself with, and&#10;remembering, the past can man obtain support in his work on&#10;earth.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In speaking, the Lieutenant lowered his arm; whereupon on to his&#10;wrist there slipped the broad golden bracelet adorned with a&#10;medallion, and there gazed at me thence the miniature of a&#10;fair-haired woman: and since the hand below it was freckled, and&#10;its flexible fingers were swollen out of shape, and had lost their&#10;symmetry, the woman&#39;s fine-drawn face looked the more full of life,&#10;and, clearly picked out, could be seen to be smiling a sweet and&#10;slightly imperious smile.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Your wife or your daughter?&#34; I queried.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My God! My God!&#34; was, with a subdued sigh, the only response&#10;vouchsafed. Then the Lieutenant raised his arm, and the bracelet&#10;slid back to its resting place under his cuff.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Over the town the columns of curling smoke were growing redder,&#10;and the clattering windows blushing to a tint of pink that recalled&#10;to my memory the livid cheeks of Virubov&#39;s &#34;niece,&#34; of the woman in&#10;whom, like her uncle, there was nothing that could provoke one to&#10;&#34;take liberties.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Next, there scaled the cemetery wall and stealthily stretched&#10;themselves on the ground, so that they looked not unlike the&#10;far-flung shadows of the cemetery&#39;s crosses, a file of dark,&#10;tattered figures of beggars, while on the further side of the&#10;slowly darkening greenery a cantor drawled in sluggish, careless&#10;accents:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;E-e-ternal me-e&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Eternal memory of what?&#34; exclaimed Lieutenant Khorvat with an&#10;angry shrug of his shoulders. &#34;Suppose, in his day, a man has been&#10;the best cucumber-salter or mushroom-pickler in a given town. Or&#10;suppose he has been the best cobbler there, or that once he said&#10;something which the street wherein he dwelt can still remember.&#10;Would not THAT man be a man whose record should be preserved, and&#10;made accessible to my recollection?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And again the Lieutenant&#39;s face wreathed itself in solid rings&#10;of pungent tobacco smoke.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Blowing softly for a moment, the wind bent the long stems of&#10;grass in the direction of the declining sun, and died away. All&#10;that remained audible amid the stillness was the peevish voices of&#10;women saying:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;To the left, I say.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh, what is to be done, Tanechka?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Expelling a fresh cloud of tobacco smoke in cylindrical form,&#10;the old man muttered:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It would seem that those women have forgotten the precise spot&#10;where their relative or friend happens to lie buried.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As a hawk flew over the sun-reddened belfry-cross, the bird&#39;s&#10;shadow glided over a memorial stone near the spot where we were&#10;sitting, glanced off the corner of the stone, and appeared anew&#10;beyond it. And in the watching of this shadow, I somehow found a&#10;pleasant diversion.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Went on the Lieutenant:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I say that a graveyard ought to evince the victory of life, the&#10;triumph of intellect and of labour, rather than the power of death.&#10;However, imagine how things would work out under my scheme. Under&#10;it the record of which I have spoken would constitute a history of&#10;a town&#39;s life which, if anything, would increase men&#39;s respect for&#10;their fellows. Yes, such a history as THAT is what a cemetery ought&#10;to be. Otherwise the place is useless. Similarly will the past&#10;prove useless if it can give us nothing. Yet is such a history ever&#10;compiled? If it is, how can one say that events are brought about&#10;by, forsooth, &#39;servants of God&#39;?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Pointing to the tombs with a gesture as though he were swimming,&#10;he paused for a moment or two.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You are a good man,&#34; I said, &#34;and a man who must have lived a&#10;good and interesting life.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He did not look at me, but answered quietly and&#10;thoughtfully:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;At least a man ought to be his fellows&#39; friend, seeing that to&#10;them he is beholden for everything that he possesses and for&#10;everything that he contains. I myself have lived&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Here, with a contraction of his brows, he fell to gazing about&#10;him, as though he were seeking the necessary word; until, seeming&#10;to fail to find it, he continued gravely:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Men need to be brought closer together, until life shall have&#10;become better adjusted. Never forget those who are departed, for&#10;anything and everything in the life of a &#39;servant of God&#39; may prove&#10;instructive and of profound significance.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;On the white sides of the memorial-stones, the setting sun was&#10;casting warm lurid reflections, until the stonework looked as&#10;though it had been splashed with hot blood. Moreover, every thing&#10;around us seemed curiously to have swelled and grown larger and&#10;softer and less cold of outline; the whole scene, though as&#10;motionless as ever, appeared to have taken on a sort of bright-red&#10;humidity, and deposited that humidity in purple, scintillating,&#10;quivering dew on the turf&#39;s various spikes and tufts. Gradually,&#10;also, the shadows were deepening and lengthening, while on the&#10;further side of the cemetery wall a cow lowed at intervals, in a&#10;gross and drunken fashion, and a party of fowls cackled what seemed&#10;to be curses in response, and a saw grated and screeched.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Suddenly the Lieutenant burst into a peal of subdued laughter,&#10;and continued to do so until his shoulders shook. At length he said&#10;through the paroxysms, as, giving me a push, he cocked his hat&#10;boyishly:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I must confess that, that&#8212;that the view which I first took of&#10;you was rather a tragic one. You see, when I saw a man lying prone&#10;on the grass I said to myself: &#39;H&#39;m! What is that?&#39; Next I saw a&#10;young fellow roaming about the cemetery with a frown settled on his&#10;face, and his breeches bulging; and again I said to myself&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;A book is lying in my breeches pocket,&#34; I interposed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ah! Then I understand. Yes, I made a mistake, but a very,&#10;welcome one. However, as I say, when I first saw you, I said to&#10;myself: &#39;There is a man lying near that tomb. Perhaps he has a&#10;bullet, a wound, in his temple?&#39; And, as you know&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He stopped to wink at me with another outburst of soft,&#10;good-humoured laughter. Then he continued.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Nevertheless, the scheme of which I have told you cannot really&#10;be called a scheme, since it is merely a fancy of my own. Yet I&#10;SHOULD like to see life lived in better fashion.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He sighed and paused, for evidently he was becoming lost in&#10;thought.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Unfortunately,&#34; he continued at last, &#34;the latter is a desire&#10;which I have conceived too late. If only I had done so fifteen&#10;years ago, when I was filling the post of Inspector of the prison&#10;at Usman&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;His left arm stretched itself out, and once more there slid on&#10;to his wrist the bracelet. For a moment he touched its gold with a&#10;rapid, but careful, delicate, movement&#8212;then he restored the trinket&#10;to its retreat, rose suddenly, looked about him for a second or two&#10;with a frown, and said in dry, brisk tones as he gave his iron-grey&#10;moustache an energetic twist:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Now I must be going.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For a while I accompanied him on his way, for I had a keen&#10;desire to hear him say something more in that pleasant, powerful&#10;bass of his; but though he stepped past the gravestones with&#10;strides as careful and regular as those of a soldier on parade, he&#10;failed again to break silence.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Just as we passed the chapel of the monastery there floated&#10;forth into the fair evening stillness, from the bars, of a window,&#10;while yet not really stirring that stillness, a hum of gruff, lazy,&#10;peevish ejaculations. Apparently they were uttered by two persons&#10;who were engaged in a dispute, since one of them muttered:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What have you done? What have you done?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And the other responded carelessly:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Hold your tongue, now! Pray hold your tongue!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 19, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/3920')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('On a River Steamer'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;The water of the river was smooth, and dull silver of tint.&#10;Also, so barely perceptible was the current that it seemed to be&#10;almost stagnant under the mist of the noontide heat, and only by&#10;the changes in the aspect of the banks could one realise how&#10;quietly and evenly the river was carrying on its surface the old&#10;yellow-hulled steamer with the white-rimmed funnel, and also the&#10;clumsy barge which was being towed in her wake.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Dreamily did the floats of the paddle-wheels slap the water.&#10;Under the planks of the deck the engines toiled without ceasing.&#10;Steam hissed and panted. At intervals the engine-room bell jarred&#10;upon the car. At intervals, also, the tiller-chains slid to and fro&#10;with a dull, rattling sound. Yet, owing to the somnolent stillness&#10;settled upon the river, these sounds escaped, failed to catch one&#39;s&#10;attention.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Through the dryness of the summer the water was low.&#10;Periodically, in the steamer&#39;s bow, a deck hand like a king, a man&#10;with a lean, yellow, black-avised face and a pair of languishing&#10;eyes, threw overboard a polished log as in tones of melting&#10;melancholy he chanted:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Se-em, se-em, shest!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;[&#34;Seven, seven, six!&#34; (the depth of water, reckoned in sazheni&#10;or fathoms)]&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was as though he were wailing:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Seyem, seyem, a yest-NISHEVO&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;[Let us eat, let us eat, but to eat there is&#8212;nothing]&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Meanwhile, the steamer kept turning her stearlet-like [The&#10;stearlet is a fish of the salmon species] prow deliberately and&#10;alternately towards either bank as the barge yawed behind her, and&#10;the grey hawser kept tautening and quivering, and sending out&#10;showers of gold and silver sparkles. Ever and anon, too, the&#10;captain on the bridge kept shouting, hoarsely through a&#10;speaking-trumpet:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;About, there!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Under the stem of the barge a wave ran which, divided into a&#10;pair of white wings, serpentined away towards either bank.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In the meadowed distance peat seemed to be being burnt, and over&#10;the black forest there had gathered an opalescent cloud of smoke&#10;which also suffused the neighbouring marshes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;To the right, the bank of the river towered up into lofty,&#10;precipitous, clayey slopes intersected with ravines wherein aspens&#10;and birches found shelter.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Everything ashore had about it a restful, sultry, deserted look.&#10;Even in the dull blue, torrid sky there was nought save a white-hot&#10;sun.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In endless vista were meadows studded with trees&#8212;trees sleeping&#10;in lonely isolation, and, in places, surmounted with either the&#10;cross of a rural church which looked like a day star or the sails&#10;of a windmill; while further back from the banks lay the tissue&#10;cloths of ripening crops, with, here and there, a human&#10;habitation.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Throughout, the scene was indistinct. Everything in it was calm,&#10;touchingly simple, intimate, intelligible, grateful to the soul. So&#10;much so that as one contemplated the slowly-varying vistas&#10;presented by the loftier bank, the immutable stretches of&#10;meadowland, and the green, timbered dance-rings where the forest&#10;approached the river, to gaze at itself in the watery mirror, and&#10;recede again into the peaceful distance; as one gazed at all this&#10;one could not but reflect that nowhere else could a spot more&#10;simply, more kindly, more beautiful be found, than these peaceful&#10;shores of the great river.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Yet already a few shrubs by the river&#39;s margin were beginning to&#10;display yellow leaves, though the landscape as a whole was smiling&#10;the doubtful, meditative smile of a young bride who, about to bear&#10;her first child, is feeling at once nervous and delighted at the&#10;prospect.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The hour was past noon, and the third-class passengers, languid&#10;with fatigue induced by the heat, were engaged in drinking either&#10;tea or beer. Seated mostly on the bulwarks of the steamer, they&#10;silently scanned the banks, while the deck quivered, crockery&#10;clattered at the buffet, and the deck hand in the bows sighed&#10;soporifically:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Six! Six! Six-and-a-half!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;From the engine-room a grimy stoker emerged. Rolling along, and&#10;scraping his bare feet audibly against the deck, he approached the&#10;boatswain&#39;s cabin, where the said boatswain, a fair-haired,&#10;fair-bearded man from Kostroma was standing in the doorway. The&#10;senior official contracted his rugged eyes quizzically, and&#10;inquired:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Whither in such a hurry?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;To pick a bone with Mitka.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Good!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With a wave of his black hand the stoker resumed his way, while&#10;the boatswain, yawning, fell to casting his eyes about him. On a&#10;locker near the companion of the engine-room a small man in a buff&#10;pea-jacket, a new cap, and a pair of boots on which there were&#10;clots of dried mud, was seated.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Through lack of diversion the boatswain began to feel inclined&#10;to hector somebody, so cried sternly to the man in question:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Hi there, chawbacon!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The man on the locker turned about&#8212;turned nervously, and much as&#10;a bullock turns. That is to say, he turned with his whole body.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why have you gone and put yourself THERE?&#34; inquired the&#10;boatswain. &#34;Though there is a notice to tell you NOT to sit there,&#10;it is there that you must go and sit! Can&#39;t you read?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Rising, the passenger inspected not the notice, but the locker.&#10;Then he replied:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Read? Yes, I CAN read.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Then why sit there where you oughtn&#39;t to?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I cannot see any notice.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well, it&#39;s hot there anyway, and the smell of oil comes up from&#10;the engines&#8230; . Whence have you come?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;From Kashira.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Long from home?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Three weeks, about.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Any rain at your place?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No. But why?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;How come your boots are so muddy?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The passenger lowered his head, extended cautiously first one&#10;foot, and then the other, scrutinised them both, and replied:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You see, they are not my boots.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With a roar of laughter that caused his brilliant beard to&#10;project from his chin, the boatswain retorted:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I think you must drink a bit.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The passenger said nothing more, but retreated quietly, and with&#10;short strides, to the stem. From the fact that the sleeves of his&#10;pea-jacket reached far below his wrists, it was clear that the&#10;garment had originated from the shoulders of another man.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As for the boatswain, on noting the circumspection and&#10;diffidence with which the passenger walked, he frowned, sucked at&#10;his beard, approached a sailor who was engaged in vigorously&#10;scrubbing the brass on the door of the captain&#39;s cabin with a naked&#10;palm, and said in an undertone:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Did you happen to notice the gait of that little man there in&#10;the light pea-jacket and dirty boots?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I did.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Then see here. Do keep an eye upon him.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But why? Is he a bad lot?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Something like it, I think.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I will then.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At a table near the hatchway of the first-class cabin, a fat man&#10;in grey was drinking beer. Already he had reached a state of&#10;moderate fuddlement, for his eyes were protruding sightlessly and&#10;staring unwinkingly at the opposite wall. Meanwhile, a number of&#10;flies were swarming in the sticky puddles on the table, or else&#10;crawling over his greyish beard and the brick-red skin of his&#10;motionless features.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The boatswain winked in his direction, and remarked:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Half-seas over, HE is.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;&#39;Tis his way,&#34; a pockmarked, eyebrow-less sailor responded.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Here the drunken man sneezed: with the result that a cloud of&#10;flies were blown over the table. Looking at them, and sighing as&#10;his companion had done, the boatswain thoughtfully observed:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why, he regularly sneezes flies, eh?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;hr /&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The resting-place which I myself had selected was a stack of&#10;firewood over the stokehole shoot; and as I lay upon it I could see&#10;the hills gradually darkening the water with a mourning veil as&#10;calmly they advanced to meet the steamer; while in the meadows, a&#10;last lingering glow of the sunset&#39;s radiance was reddening the&#10;stems of the birches, and making the newly mended roof of a hut&#10;look as though it were cased in red fustian&#8212;communicating to&#10;everything else in the vicinity a semblance of floating amid&#10;fire&#8212;and effacing all outline, and causing the scene as a whole to&#10;dissolve into streaks of red and orange and blue, save where, on a&#10;hill above the hut, a black grove of firs stood thrown into tense,&#10;keen, and clear-cut relief.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Under a hill a party of fishermen had lit a wood fire, the&#10;flames of which could be seen playing upon, and picking out, the&#10;white hull of a boat&#8212;the dark figure of a man therein, a fishing&#10;net suspended from some stakes, and a woman in a yellow bodice who&#10;was sitting beside the fire. Also, amid the golden radiance there&#10;could be distinguished a quivering of the leaves on the lower&#10;branches of the tree whereunder the woman sat shaded.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;All the river was calm, and not a sound occurred to break the&#10;stillness ashore, while the air under the awning of the third-class&#10;portion of the vessel felt as stifling as during the earlier part&#10;of the day. By this time the conversation of the passengers, damped&#10;by the shadow of dusk, had merged into a single sound which&#10;resembled the humming of bees; and amid it one could not&#10;distinguish nor divine who was speaking, nor the subject of&#10;discussion, since every word therein seemed disconnected, even&#10;though all appeared to be talking amicably, and in order,&#10;concerning a common topic. At one moment a suppressed laugh from a&#10;young woman would reach the ear; in the cabin, a party who had&#10;agreed to sing a song of general acceptation were failing to hit&#10;upon one, and disputing the point in low and dispassionate accents;&#10;and in each, such sound there was something vespertinal, gently&#10;sad, softly prayer-like.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;From behind the firewood near me a thick, rasping voice said in&#10;deliberate tones:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;At first he was a useful young fellow enough, and clean and&#10;spruce; but lately, he has become shabby and dirty, and is going to&#10;the dogs.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Another voice, loud and gruff, replied:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Aha! Avoid the ladies, or one is bound to go amiss.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The saying has it that always a fish makes for deeper&#10;water.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Besides, he is a fool, and that is worse still. By the way, he&#10;is a relative of yours, isn&#39;t he?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes. He is my brother.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Indeed? Then pray forgive me.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Certainly; but, to speak plainly, he is a fool.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At this moment I saw the passenger in the buff pea-jacket&#10;approach the sally-port, grasp with his left hand a stanchion, and&#10;step on to the grating under which one of the paddle-wheels was&#10;churning the water to foam. There he stood looking over the&#10;bulwarks with a swinging motion akin to that of a bat when,&#10;grappling some object or another with its wings, it hangs suspended&#10;in the air. The fact that the man&#39;s cap was drawn tightly over his&#10;ears caused the latter to stick out almost to the point of&#10;absurdity.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Presently he turned and peered into the gloom under the awning,&#10;though, seemingly, he failed to distinguish myself reposing on the&#10;firewood. This enabled me to gain a clear view of a face with a&#10;sharp nose, some tufts of light-coloured hair on cheeks and chin,&#10;and a pair of small, muddy-looking eyes. He stood there as though&#10;he were listening to something.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;All of a sudden he stepped firmly to the sally-port, swiftly&#10;unlashed from the iron top-rail a mop, and threw it overboard. Then&#10;he set about unlashing a second article of the same species.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Hi!&#34; I shouted to him. &#34;What are you doing there?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With a start the man turned round, clapped a hand to his&#10;forehead to discover my whereabouts, and replied softly and&#10;rapidly, and with a stammer in his voice:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;How is that your business? Get away with you!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Upon this I approached him, for I was astonished and amused at&#10;his impudence.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;For what you have done the sailors will make you pay right&#10;enough,&#34; I remarked.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He tucked up the sleeves of his pea-jacket as though he were&#10;preparing for a fight. Then, stamping his foot upon the slippery&#10;grating, he muttered:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I perceived the mop to have come untied, and to be in danger of&#10;falling into the water through the vibration. Upon that I tried to&#10;secure it, and failed, for it slipped from my hands as I was doing&#10;so.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But,&#34; I remarked in amazement, &#34;my belief is that you WILLFULLY&#10;untied the mop, to throw it overboard!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Come, come!&#34; he retorted. &#34;Why should I have done that? What an&#10;extraordinary thing it would have been to do! How could it have&#10;been possible?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Here he dodged me with a dexterous movement, and, rearranging&#10;his sleeves, walked away. The length of the pea-jacket made his&#10;legs look absurdly short, and caused me to notice that in his gait&#10;there was a tendency to shuffle and hesitate.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Returning to my retreat, I stretched myself upon the firewood&#10;once more, inhaled its resinous odour, and fell to listening to the&#10;slow-moving dialogue of some of the passengers around me.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ah, good sir,&#34; a gruff, sarcastic voice began at my side&#8212;but&#10;instantly a yet gruffer voice intervened with:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh, nothing, except that to ask a question is easy, and to&#10;answer it may be difficult.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;True.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;From the ravines a mist was spreading over the river.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;hr /&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At length night fell, and as folk relapsed into slumber the&#10;babel of tongues became stilled. The car, as it grew used to the&#10;boisterous roar of the engines and the measured rhythm of the&#10;paddle-wheels, did not at first notice the new sound born of the&#10;fact that into the sounds previously made familiar there began to&#10;intrude the snores of slumberers, and the padding of soft&#10;footsteps, and an excited whisper of:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I said to him&#8212;yes, I said: &#39;Yasha, you must not, you shall not,&#10;do this.&#39;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The banks had disappeared from view. Indeed, one continued to be&#10;reminded of their existence only by the slow passage of the&#10;scattered fires ashore, and the fact that the darkness lay blacker&#10;and denser around those fires than elsewhere. Dimly reflected in&#10;the river, the stars seemed to be absolutely motionless, whereas&#10;the trailing, golden reproductions of the steamer&#39;s lights never&#10;ceased to quiver, as though striving to break adrift, and float&#10;away into the obscurity. Meanwhile, foam like tissue paper was&#10;licking our dark hull, while at our stern, and sometimes overtaking&#10;it, there trailed a barge with a couple of lanterns in her prow,&#10;and a third on her mast, which at one moment marked the reflections&#10;of the stars, and at another became merged with the gleams of&#10;firelight on one or the other bank.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;On a bench under a lantern near the spot where I was lying a&#10;stout woman was asleep. With one hand resting upon a small bundle&#10;under her head, she had her bodice torn under the armpit, so that&#10;the white flesh and a tuft of hair could be seen protruding. Also,&#10;her face was large, dark of brow, and full of jowl to a point that&#10;caused the cheeks to roll to her very ears. Lastly, her thick lips&#10;were parted in an ungainly, corpselike smile.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;From my own position on a level higher than hers, I looked&#10;dreamily down upon her, and reflected: &#34;She is a little over forty&#10;years of age, and (probably) a good woman. Also, she is travelling&#10;to visit either her daughter and son-in-law, or her son and&#10;daughter-in-law, and therefore is taking with her some presents.&#10;Also, there is in her large heart much of the excellent and&#10;maternal.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Suddenly something near me flashed as though a match had been&#10;struck, and, opening my eyes, I perceived the passenger in the&#10;curious pea-jacket to be standing near the woman spoken of, and&#10;engaged in shielding a lighted match with his sleeve. Presently, he&#10;extended his hand and cautiously applied the particle of flame to&#10;the tuft of hair under the woman&#39;s armpit. There followed a faint&#10;hiss, and a noxious smell of burning hair was wafted to my&#10;nostrils.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I leapt up, seized the man by the collar, and shook him&#10;soundly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What are you at?&#34; I exclaimed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Turning in my grasp he whispered with a scarcely audible, but&#10;exceedingly repulsive, giggle:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Haven&#39;t I given her a good fright, eh?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then he added:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Now, let me go! Let go, I say!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Have you lost your wits?&#34; I retorted with a gasp.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For a moment or two his blinking eyes continued to glance at&#10;something over my shoulder. Then they returned to me, while he&#10;whispered:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Pray let me go. The truth is that, unable to sleep, I conceived&#10;that I would play this woman a trick. Was there any harm in that?&#10;See, now. She is still asleep.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As I thrust him away his short legs, legs which might almost&#10;have been amputated, staggered under him. Meanwhile I&#10;reflected:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No, I was NOT wrong. He DID of set purpose throw the mop&#10;overboard. What a fellow!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A bell sounded from the engine-room.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Slow!&#34; someone shouted with a cheerful hail.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Upon that, steam issued with such resounding shrillness that the&#10;woman awoke with a jerk of her head; and as she put up her left&#10;hand to feel her armpit, her crumpled features gathered themselves&#10;into wrinkles. Then she glanced at the lamp, raised herself to a&#10;sitting position, and, fingering the place where the hair had been&#10;destroyed, said softly to herself:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh, holy Mother of God!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Presently the steamer drew to a wharf, and, with a loud&#10;clattering, firewood was dragged forth and cast into the stokehole&#10;with uncouth, warning cries of &#34;Tru-us-sha!&#34; [The word means ship&#39;s&#10;hold or stokehole, but here is, probably, equivalent to the English&#10;&#34;Heads below!&#34;]&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Over a little town which had its back pressed against a hill the&#10;waning moon was rising and brightening all the black river, causing&#10;it to gather life as the radiance laved, as it were, the landscape&#10;in warm water.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Walking aft, I seated myself among some bales and contemplated&#10;the town&#39;s frontage. Over one end of it rose, tapering like a&#10;walking-stick, a factory chimney, while at the other end, as well&#10;as in the middle, rose belfries, one of which had a gilded steeple,&#10;and the other one a steeple either green or blue, but looking black&#10;in the moonlight, and shaped like a ragged paint-brush.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Opposite the wharf there was stuck in the wide gable of a&#10;two-storied building a lantern which, flickering, diffused but a&#10;dull, anaemic light from its dirty panes, while over the long strip&#10;of the broken signboard of the building there could be seen&#10;straggling, and executed in large yellow letters, the words,&#10;&#34;Tavern and&#8212;&#34; No more of the legend than this was visible.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Lanterns were hanging in two or three other spots in the drowsy&#10;little town; and wherever their murky stains of light hung&#10;suspended in the air there stood out in relief a medley of gables,&#10;drab-tinted trees, and false windows in white paint, on walls of a&#10;dull slate colour.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Somehow I found contemplation of the scene depressing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Meanwhile the vessel continued to emit steam as she rocked to&#10;and fro with a creaking of wood, a slap-slapping of water, and a&#10;scrubbing of her sides against the wharf. At length someone&#10;ejaculated surlily:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Fool, you must be asleep! The winch, you say? Why, the winch is&#10;at the stern, damn you!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Off again, thank the Lord!&#34; added the rasping voice already&#10;heard from behind the bales, while to it an equally familiar voice&#10;rejoined with a yawn:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It&#39;s time we WERE off!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Said a hoarse voice:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Look here, young fellow. What was it he shouted?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Hastily and inarticulately, with a great deal of smacking of the&#10;lips and stuttering, someone replied:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;He shouted: &#39;Kinsmen, do not kill me! Have some mercy, for&#10;Christ&#39;s sake, and I will make over to you everything&#8212;yes,&#10;everything into your good hands for ever! Only let me go away, and&#10;expiate my sins, and save my soul through prayer. Aye, I will go on&#10;a pilgrimage, and remain hidden my life long, to the very end.&#10;Never shall you hear of me again, nor see me.&#39; Then Uncle Peter&#10;caught him a blow on the head, and his blood splashed out upon me.&#10;As he fell I&#8212;well, I ran away, and made for the tavern, where I&#10;knocked at the door and shouted: &#39;Sister, they have killed our&#10;father!&#39; Upon that, she put her head out of the window, but only&#10;said: &#39;That merely means that the rascal is making an excuse for&#10;vodka.&#39;&#8230; Aye, a terrible time it was&#8212;was that night! And how&#10;frightened I felt! At first, I made for the garret, but presently&#10;thought to myself: &#39;No; they would soon find me there, and put me&#10;to an end as well, for I am the heir direct, and should be the&#10;first to succeed to the property.&#39; So I crawled on to the roof, and&#10;there lay hidden behind the chimney-stack, holding on with arms and&#10;legs, while unable to speak for sheer terror.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What were you afraid of?&#34; a brusque voice interrupted.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What was I afraid of?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;At all events, you joined your uncle in killing your father,&#10;didn&#39;t you?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;In such an hour one has not time to think&#8212;one just kills a man&#10;because one can&#39;t help oneself, or because it seems so easy to&#10;kill.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;True,&#34; the hoarser voice commented in dull and ponderous&#10;accents. &#34;When once blood has flowed the fact leads to more blood,&#10;and if a man has started out to kill, he cares nothing for any&#10;reason&#8212;he finds good enough the reason which comes first to his&#10;hand.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But if this young fellow is speaking the truth, he had a&#10;BUSINESS reason&#8212;though, properly speaking, even property ought not&#10;to provoke quarrels.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Similarly one ought not to kill just when one chooses. Folk who&#10;commit such crimes should have justice meted out to them.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, but it is difficult always to obtain such justice. For&#10;instance, this young fellow seems to have spent over a year in&#10;prison for nothing.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;&#39;For nothing&#39;? Why, did he not entice his father into the hut,&#10;and then shut the door upon him, and throw a coat over his head? He&#10;has said so himself. &#39;For nothing,&#39; indeed!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Upon this the rapid stream of sobbed, disconnected words, which&#10;I had heard before from some speaker poured forth anew. Somehow, I&#10;guessed that it came from the man in the dirty boots, as once more&#10;he recounted the story of the murder.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I do not wish to justify myself,&#34; he said. &#34;I say merely that,&#10;inasmuch as I was promised a reprieve at the trial, I told&#10;everything, and was therefore allowed to go free, while my uncle&#10;and my brother were sentenced to penal servitude.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But you KNEW that they had agreed to kill him?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well, it is my idea that at first they intended only to give&#10;him a good fright. Never did my father recognise me as his&#10;son&#8212;always he called me a Jesuit.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The gruffer of the two voices pulled up the speaker.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;To think,&#34; it said, &#34;that you can actually talk about it&#10;all!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why shouldn&#39;t I? My father brought tears to the eyes of many an&#10;innocent person.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;A fig for people&#39;s tears! If our causes of tears were one and&#10;all to be murdered, what would the state of things become? Shed&#10;tears, but never blood; for blood is not yours to shed. And even if&#10;you should believe your own blood to be your own, know that it is&#10;not so, that your blood does not belong to you, but to Someone&#10;Else.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The point in question was my father&#39;s property. It all shows&#10;how a man may live awhile, and earn his living, and then suddenly&#10;go amiss, and lose his wits, and even conceive a grudge against his&#10;own father&#8230; . Now I must get some sleep.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Behind the bales all grew quiet. Presently I rose to peer in&#10;that direction. The passenger in the buff pea-jacket was sitting&#10;huddled up against a coil of rope, with his hands thrust into his&#10;sleeves, and his chin resting upon his arms. As the moon was&#10;shining straight into his face, I could see that the latter was as&#10;livid as that of a corpse, and had its brows drawn down over its&#10;narrow, insignificant eyes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Beside him, and close to my head, there was lying stretched on&#10;the top of the coil of rope a broad-shouldered peasant in a short&#10;smock and a pair of patched boots of white felt. The ringlets of&#10;the wearer&#39;s curly beard were thrust upwards, and his hands clasped&#10;behind his head, and with ox-like eyes he stared at the zenith&#10;where a few stars were shining, and the moon was beginning to&#10;sink.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At length, in a trumpet-like voice (though he seemed to do his&#10;best to soften it) the peasant asked:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Your uncle is on that barge, I suppose?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;He is. And so is my brother.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yet you are here! How strange!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The dark barge, towed against the steamer&#39;s blue-silver wash of&#10;foam, was cleaving it like a plough, while under the moon the&#10;lights of the barge showed white, and the hull and the prisoners&#39;&#10;cage stood raised high out of the water as to our right the black,&#10;indentated bank glided past in sinuous convolutions.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;From the whole, soft, liquescent fluid scene, the impression&#10;which I derived was melancholy. It evoked in my spirit a sense of&#10;instability, a lack of restfulness.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why are you travelling?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Because I wish to have a word with him.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;With your uncle?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;About the property?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What else?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Then look here, my young fellow. Drop it all&#8212;both your uncle&#10;and the property, and betake yourself to a monastery, and there&#10;live and pray. For if you have shed blood, and especially if you&#10;have shed the blood of a kinsman, you will stand for ever estranged&#10;from all, while, moreover, bloodshed is a dangerous thing&#8212;it may at&#10;any time come back upon you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But the property?&#34; the young fellow asked with a lift of his&#10;head.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Let it go,&#34; the peasant vouchsafed as he closed his eyes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;On the younger man&#39;s face the down twitched as though a wind had&#10;stirred it. He yawned, and looked about him for a moment. Then,&#10;descrying myself, he cried in a tone of resentment:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What are you looking at? And why do you keep following me&#10;about?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Here the big peasant opened his eyes, and, with a glance first&#10;at the man, and then at myself, growled:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Less noise there, you mitten-face!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As I retired to my nook and lay down, I reflected that what the&#10;big peasant had said was apposite enough-that the young fellow&#39;s&#10;face did in very truth resemble an old and shabby woollen&#10;mitten.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Presently I dreamt that I was painting a belfry, and that, as I&#10;did so, huge, goggle-eyed jackdaws kept flying around the belfry&#39;s&#10;gables, and flapping at me with their wings and hindering my work:&#10;until, as I sought to beat them off, I missed my footing, fell to&#10;earth, and awoke to find my breath choking amid a dull, sick,&#10;painful feeling of lassitude and weakness, and a kaleidoscopic mist&#10;quavering before my eyes till it rendered me dizzy. From my head,&#10;behind the car, a thin stream of blood was trickling.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Rising with some difficulty to my feet, I stepped aft to a pump,&#10;washed my head under a jet of cold water, bound it with my&#10;handkerchief, and, returning, inspected my resting-place in a state&#10;of bewilderment as to what could have caused the accident to&#10;happen.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;On the deck near the spot where I had been asleep, there was&#10;standing stacked a pile of small logs prepared for the cook&#39;s&#10;galley; while, in the precise spot where my head had rested there&#10;was reposing a birch faggot of which the withy-tie had come&#10;unfastened. As I raised the fallen faggot I perceived it to be&#10;clean and composed of silky loppings of birch-bark which rustled as&#10;I fingered them; and, consequently, I reflected that the ceaseless&#10;vibration of the steamer must have caused the faggot to become&#10;jerked on to my head.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Reassured by this plausible explanation of the unfortunate, but&#10;absurd, occurrence of which I have spoken, I next returned to the&#10;stern, where there were no oppressive odours to be encountered, and&#10;whence a good view was obtainable.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The hour was the turn of the night, the hour of maximum tension&#10;before dawn, the hour when all the world seems plunged in a&#10;profundity of slumber whence there can be no awakening, and when&#10;the completeness of the silence attunes the soul to special&#10;sensibility, and when the stars seem to be hanging strangely close&#10;to earth, and the morning star, in particular, to be shining as&#10;brightly as a miniature sun. Yet already had the heavens begun to&#10;grow coldly grey, to lose their nocturnal softness and warmth,&#10;while the rays of the stars were drooping like petals, and the&#10;moon, hitherto golden, had turned pale and become dusted over with&#10;silver, and moved further from the earth as intangibly the water of&#10;the river sloughed its thick, viscous gleam, and swiftly emitted&#10;and withdrew, stray, pearly reflections of the changes occurring in&#10;the heavenly tints.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In the east there was rising, and hanging suspended over the&#10;black spears of the pine forest, a thin pink mist the sensuous hue&#10;of which was glowing ever brighter, and assuming a density ever&#10;greater, and standing forth more boldly and clearly, even as a&#10;whisper of timid prayer merges into a song of exultant&#10;thankfulness. Another moment, and the spiked tops of the pines&#10;blazed into points of red fire resembling festival candles in a&#10;sanctuary.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Next, an unseen hand threw over the water, drew along its&#10;surface, a transparent and many-coloured net of silk. This was the&#10;morning breeze, herald of dawn, as with a coating of tissue-like,&#10;silvery scales it rippled the river until the eye grew weary of&#10;trying to follow the play of gold and mother-of-pearl and purple&#10;and bluish-green reflected from the sun-renovated heavens.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Next, like a fan there unfolded themselves the first&#10;sword-shaped beams of day, with their tips blindingly white; while&#10;simultaneously one seemed to hear descending from an illimitable&#10;height a dense sound-wave of silver bells, a sound-wave advancing&#10;triumphantly to greet the sun as his roseate rim became visible&#10;over the forest like the rim of a cup that, filled with the essence&#10;of life, was about to empty its contents upon the earth, and to&#10;pour a bounteous flood of creative puissance upon the marshes&#10;whence a reddish vapour as of incense was arising. Meanwhile on the&#10;more precipitous of the two banks some of the trees near the&#10;river&#39;s margin were throwing soft green shadows over the water,&#10;while gilt-like dew was sparkling on the herbage, and birds were&#10;awakening, and as a white gull skimmed the water&#39;s surface on level&#10;wings, the pale shadow of those wings followed the bird over the&#10;tinted expanse, while the sun, suspended in flame behind the&#10;forest, like the Imperial bird of the fairy-tale, rose higher and&#10;higher into the greenish-blue zenith, until silvery Venus,&#10;expiring, herself looked like a bird.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Here and there on the yellow strip of sand by the river&#39;s&#10;margin, long-legged snipe were scurrying about. Two fishermen were&#10;rocking in a boat in the steamer&#39;s wash as they hauled their&#10;tackle. Floating from the shore there began to reach us such vocal&#10;sounds of morning as the crowing of cocks, the lowing of cattle,&#10;and the persistent murmur of human voices.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Similarly the buff-coloured bales in the steamer&#39;s stem&#10;gradually reddened, as did the grey tints in the beard of the large&#10;peasant where, sprawling his ponderous form over the deck, he was&#10;lying asleep with mouth open, nostrils distended with stertorous&#10;snores, brows raised as though in astonishment, and thick moustache&#10;intermittently twitching.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Someone amid the piles of bales was panting as he fidgeted, and&#10;as I glanced in that direction I encountered the gaze of a pair of&#10;small, narrow, inflamed eyes, and beheld before me the ragged,&#10;mitten-like face, though now it looked even thinner and greyer than&#10;it had done on the previous evening. Apparently its owner was&#10;feeling cold, for he had hunched his chin between his knees, and&#10;clasped his hirsute arms around his legs, as his eyes stared&#10;gloomily, with a hunted air, in my direction. Then wearily,&#10;lifelessly he said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, you have found me. And now you can thrash me if you wish&#10;to do so&#8212;you can give me a blow, for I gave you one, and,&#10;consequently, it&#39;s your turn to do the hitting.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Stupefied with astonishment, I inquired in an undertone.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It was you, then, that hit me?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It was so, but where are your witnesses?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The words came in hoarse, croaked, suppressed accents, with a&#10;separation of the hands, and an upthrow of the head and projecting&#10;cars which had such a comical look of being crushed beneath the&#10;weight of the battened-down cap. Next, thrusting his hands into the&#10;pockets of his pea-jacket, the man repeated in a tone of&#10;challenge:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Where, I say, are your witnesses? You can go to the devil!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I could discern in him something at once helpless and froglike&#10;which evoked in me a strong feeling of repulsion; and since, with&#10;that, I had no real wish to converse with him, or even to revenge&#10;myself upon him for his cowardly blow, I turned away in&#10;silence.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But a moment later I looked at him again, and saw that he was&#10;seated in his former posture, with his arms embracing his knees,&#10;his chin resting upon them, and his red, sleepless eyes gazing&#10;lifelessly at the barge which the steamer was towing between wide&#10;ribbons of foaming water&#8212;ribbons sparkling in the sunlight like&#10;mash in a brewer&#39;s vat.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And those eyes, that dead, alienated expression, the gay&#10;cheerfulness of the morning, and the clear radiance of the heavens,&#10;and the kindly tints of the two banks, and the vocal sounds of the&#10;June day, and the bracing freshness of the air, and the whole scene&#10;around us served but to throw into the more tragic relief.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;hr /&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Just as the steamer was leaving Sundir the man threw himself&#10;into the water; in the sight of everybody he sprang overboard. Upon&#10;that all shouted, jostled their neighbours as they rushed to the&#10;side, and fell to scanning the river where from bank to bank it lay&#10;wrapped in blinding glitter.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The whistle sounded in fitful alarm, the sailors threw lifebelts&#10;overboard, the deck rumbled like a drum under the crowd&#39;s surging&#10;rush, steam hissed afflightedly, a woman vented an hysterical cry,&#10;and the captain bawled from the bridge the imperious command:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Avast heaving lifebelts! By now the fool will have got one!&#10;Damn you, calm the passengers!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;An unwashed, untidy priest with timid, staring eyes thrust back&#10;his long, dishevelled hair, and fell to repeating, as his fat&#10;shoulder jostled all and sundry, and his feet tripped people&#10;up.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;A muzhik, is it, or a woman? A muzhik, eh?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;By the time that I had made my way to the stern the man had&#10;fallen far behind the stern of the barge, and his head looked as&#10;small as a fly on the glassy surface of the water. However, towards&#10;that fly a fishing-boat was already darting with the swiftness of a&#10;water beetle, and causing its two oars to show quiveringly red and&#10;grey, while from the marshier of the two banks there began hastily&#10;to put out a second boat which leapt in the steamer&#39;s wash with the&#10;gaiety of a young calf.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Suddenly there broke into the painful hubbub on the steamer&#39;s&#10;deck a faint, heartrending cry of &#34;A-a-ah!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In answer to it a sharp-nosed, black-bearded, well-dressed&#10;peasant muttered with a smack of his lips:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ah! That is him shouting. What a madman he must have been! And&#10;an ugly customer too, wasn&#39;t he?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The peasant with the curly beard rejoined in a tone of&#10;conviction engulfing all other utterances:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It is his conscience that is catching him. Think what you like,&#10;but never can conscience be suppressed.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Therewith, constantly interrupting one another, the pair betook&#10;themselves to a public recital of the tragic story of the&#10;fair-haired young fellow, whom the fishermen had now lifted from&#10;the water, and were conveying towards the steamer with oars that&#10;oscillated at top speed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The bearded peasant continued:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;As soon as it was seen that he was but running after the&#10;soldier&#39;s wife.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Besides,&#34; the other peasant interrupted, &#34;the property was not&#10;to be divided after the death of the father.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With which the bearded muzhik eagerly recounted the history of&#10;the murder done by the brother, the nephew, and a son, while the&#10;spruce, spare, well-dressed peasant interlarded the general buzz of&#10;conversation with words and comments cheerfully and stridently&#10;delivered, much as though he were driving in stakes for the&#10;erection of a fence.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Every man is drawn most in the direction whither he finds it&#10;easiest to go.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Then it will be the Devil that will be drawing him, since the&#10;direction of Hell is always the easiest.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well, YOU will not be going that way, I suppose? You don&#39;t&#10;altogether fancy it?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why should I?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Because you have declared it to be the easiest way.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well, I am not a saint.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No, ha-ha! you are not.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And you mean that&#8212;?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I mean nothing. If a dog&#39;s chain be short, he is not to be&#10;blamed.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Whereupon, setting nose to nose, the pair plunged into a quarrel&#10;still more heated as they expounded in simple, but often curiously&#10;apposite, language opinions intelligible to themselves alone. The&#10;one peasant, a lean fellow with lengthy limbs, cold, sarcastic&#10;eyes, and a dark, bony countenance, spoke loudly and sonorously,&#10;with frequent shrugs of the shoulders, while the other peasant, a&#10;man stout and broad of build who until now had seemed calm,&#10;self-assured of demeanour, and a man of settled views, breathed&#10;heavily, while his oxlike eyes glowed with an ardour causing his&#10;face to flush patchily, and his beard to stick out from his&#10;chin.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Look here, for instance,&#34; he growled as he gesticulated and&#10;rolled his dull eyes about. &#34;How can that be? Does not even God&#10;know wherein a man ought to restrain himself?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;If the Devil be one&#39;s master, God doesn&#39;t come into the&#10;matter.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Liar! For who was the first who raised his hand against his&#10;fellow?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Cain.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And the first man who repented of a sin?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Adam.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ah! You see!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Here there broke into the dispute a shout of: &#34;They are just&#10;getting him aboard!&#34; and the crowd, rushing away from the stern,&#10;carried with it the two disputants&#8212;the sparer peasant; lowering his&#10;shoulders, and buttoning up his jacket as he went; while the&#10;bearded peasant, following at his heels, thrust his head forward in&#10;a surly manner as he shifted his cap from the one ear to the&#10;other.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With a ponderous beating of paddles against the current the&#10;steamer heaved to, and the captain shouted through a&#10;speaking-trumpet, with a view to preventing a collision between the&#10;barge and the stem of the vessel:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Put her over! Put her o-o-ove-r!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Soon the fishing-boat came alongside, and the half-drowned man,&#10;with a form as limp as a half-empty sack, and water exuding from&#10;every stitch, and his hitherto haggard face grown smooth and&#10;simple-looking, was hoisted on board.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Next, on the sailors laying him upon the hatchway of the baggage&#10;hold, he sat up, leaned forward, smoothed his wet hair with the&#10;palms of his hands, and asked dully, without looking at anyone:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Have they also recovered my cap?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Someone among the throng around him exclaimed reprovingly:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It is not about your cap that you ought to be thinking, but&#10;about your soul.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Upon this he hiccuped loudly and freely, like a camel, and&#10;emitted a stream of turgid water from his mouth. Then, looking at&#10;the crowd with lack-lustre eyes, he said in an apathetic tone:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Let me be taken elsewhere.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In answer, the boatswain sternly bade him stretch himself out,&#10;and this the young fellow did, with his hands clasped under his&#10;head, and his eyes closed, while the boatswain added brusquely to&#10;the onlookers:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Move away, move away, good people. What is there to stare at?&#10;This is not a show&#8230; . Hi, you muzhik! Why did you play us such a&#10;trick, damn you?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The crowd however, was not to be suppressed, but indulged in&#10;comments.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;He murdered his father, didn&#39;t he?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What? THAT wretched creature?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As for the boatswain, he squatted upon his heels, and proceeded&#10;to subject the rescued man to a course of strict interrogation.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What is the destination marked on your ticket?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Perm.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Then you ought to leave the boat at Kazan. And what is your&#10;name?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yakov.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And your surname?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Bashkin&#8212;though we are known also as the Bukolov family.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Your family has a DOUBLE surname, then?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With the full power of his trumpet-like lungs the bearded&#10;peasant (evidently he had lost his temper) broke in:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Though his uncle and his brother have been sentenced to penal&#10;servitude and are travelling together on that barge, he&#8212;well, he&#10;has received his discharge! That is only a personal matter,&#10;however. In spite of what judges may say, one ought never to kill,&#10;since conscience cannot bear the thought of blood. Even nearly to&#10;become a murderer is wrong.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;By this time more and more passengers had collected as they&#10;awakened from sleep and emerged from the first- and second-class&#10;cabins. Among them was the mate, a man with a black moustache and&#10;rubicund features who inquired of someone amid the confusion: &#34;You&#10;are not a doctor, I suppose?&#34; and received the astonished,&#10;high-pitched reply: &#34;No, sir, nor ever have been one.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;To this someone added with a drawl:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why is a doctor needed? Surely the man is a fellow of no&#10;particular importance?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Over the river the radiance of the summer daylight had gathered&#10;increased strength, and, since the date was a Sunday, bells were&#10;sounding seductively from a hill, and a couple of women in gala&#10;apparel who were following the margin of the river waved&#10;handkerchiefs towards the steamer, and shouted some greeting.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Meanwhile the young fellow lay motionless, with his eyes closed.&#10;Divested of his pea-jacket, and wrapped about with wet, clinging&#10;underclothing, he looked more symmetrical than previously&#8212;his chest&#10;seemed better developed, his body plumper, and his face more rotund&#10;and less ugly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Yet though the passengers gazed at him with compassion or&#10;distaste or severity or fear, as the case might be, all did so&#10;without ceremony, as though he had not been a living man at&#10;all.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For instance, a gaunt gentleman in a grey frock-coat said to a&#10;lady in a yellow straw hat adorned with a pink ribbon:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;At our place, in Riazan, when a certain master-watchmaker went&#10;and hanged himself to a ventilator, he first of all stopped every&#10;watch and clock in his shop. Now, the question is, why did he stop&#10;them?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;An abnormal case indeed!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;On the other hand, a dark-browed woman who had her hands hidden&#10;beneath her shawl stood gazing at the rescued man in silence, and&#10;with her side turned towards him. As she did so tears were welling&#10;in her grey-blue eyes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Presently two sailors appeared. One of them bent over the young&#10;fellow, touched him on the shoulder, and said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Hi! You are to get up.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Whereupon the young fellow rose, and was removed&#10;elsewhither.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When, after an interval, he reappeared on deck, he was clean and&#10;dry, and clad in a cook&#39;s white jumper and a sailor&#39;s blue serge&#10;trousers. Clasping his hands behind his back, hunching his&#10;shoulders, and bending his head forward, he walked swiftly to the&#10;stern, with a throng of idlers&#8212;at first one by one, and then in&#10;parties of from three to a dozen&#8212;following in his wake.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The man seated himself upon a coil of rope, and, craning his&#10;neck in wolf-like fashion to eye the bystanders, frowned, let fall&#10;his temples upon hands thrust into his flaxen hair, and fixed his&#10;gaze upon the barge.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Standing or sitting about in the hot sunshine, people stared at&#10;him without stint. Evidently they would have liked, but did not&#10;dare, to engage him in conversation. Presently the big peasant also&#10;arrived on the scene, and, after glancing at all present, took off&#10;his hat, and wiped his perspiring face. Next, a grey-headed old man&#10;with a red nose, a thin wisp of beard, and watery eyes cleared his&#10;throat, and in honeyed tones took the initiative.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Would you mind telling us how it all happened?&#34; he began.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why should I do so?&#34; retorted the young fellow without&#10;moving.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Taking a red handkerchief from his bosom, the old man shook it&#10;out and applied it cautiously to his eyes. Then he said through its&#10;folds in the quiet accents of a man who is determined to&#10;persevere:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why, you say? For the reason that the occasion is one when all&#10;ought to know the tru&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Lurching forward, the bearded peasant interposed with a&#10;rasp:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, do you tell us all about it, and things will become easier&#10;for you. For a sin always needs to be made known.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;While, like an echo, a voice said in bold and sarcastic&#10;accents:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It would be better to seize him and tie him up.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Upon this the young fellow raised his brows a little, and&#10;retorted in an undertone:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Let me bide.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The rascal!&#34; the crowd commented, while the old man, neatly&#10;folding and replacing his handkerchief, raised a hand as dry as a&#10;cock&#39;s leg, and remarked with a sharp, knowing smile:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Possibly it is not merely out of idle curiosity that folk are&#10;making this request.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Go and be damned to you!&#34; the young fellow exclaimed with a&#10;grim snap. Whereupon the big peasant bellowed out in a blustering&#10;fashion:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What? Then you will not tell us at least your destination?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Whereafter the same speaker continued to hold forth on humanity,&#10;God, and the human conscience&#8212;staring wildly around him as he did&#10;so, waving his arms about, and growing ever more frantic, until&#10;really it was curious to watch him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At length the crowd grew similarly excited, and took to&#10;encouraging the speaker with cries of &#34;True! That is so!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As for the young fellow, he listened awhile in silence, without&#10;moving. Then, straightening his back, he rose, thrust his hands&#10;into the pockets of his trousers, and, swaying his body to and fro,&#10;began to glare at the crowd with greenish eyes which were&#10;manifestly lightening to a vicious gleam. At length, thrusting&#10;forth his chest, he cried hoarsely:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;So you ask me whither I am bound? I am bound for the brigands&#39;&#10;lair, for the brigands&#39; lair, where, unless you first take and put&#10;me in fetters, I intend to cut the throat of every man that I meet.&#10;Yes, a hundred murders will I commit, for all folk will be the same&#10;to me, and not a soul will I spare. Aye, the end of my tether is&#10;reached, so take and fetter me whilst you can.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;His breath was issuing with difficulty, and as he spoke his&#10;shoulders heaved, and his legs trembled beneath him. Also, his face&#10;had turned grey and become distorted with tremors.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Upon this, the crowd broke into a gruff, ugly, resentful roar,&#10;and edged away from the man. Yet, in doing so, many of its members&#10;looked curiously like the man himself in the way that they lowered&#10;their heads, caught at their breath, and let their eyes flash.&#10;Clearly the man was in imminent danger of being assaulted.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Suddenly he recovered his subdued demeanour&#8212;he, as it were,&#10;thawed in the sunlight: until, as suddenly, his legs gave way&#10;beneath him, and, narrowly escaping injury to his face from the&#10;corner of a bale, he fell forward upon his knees as though felled&#10;with an axe. Thereafter, clutching at his throat, he shouted in a&#10;strange voice, and crowding the words upon one another:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Tell me what I am to do. Is all of it my fault? Long I lay in&#10;prison before I was tried and told to go free&#8230; yet&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tearing at his ears and cheeks, he rocked his head to and fro as&#10;though seeking to rend it from its socket. Then he continued:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yet I am NOT free. Nor is it in my power to say what will&#10;become of me. For me there remains neither life nor death.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Aha!&#34; exclaimed the big peasant; and at the sound the crowd&#10;drew back as in consternation, while some hastened to depart&#10;altogether. As for the remainder (numbering a dozen or so), they&#10;herded sullenly, nervously, involuntarily into a mass as the young&#10;fellow continued in distracted tones and with a trembling head:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh that I could sleep for the next ten years! For then could I&#10;prove myself, and decide whether I am guilty or not. Last night I&#10;struck a man with a faggot. As I was walking about I saw asleep a&#10;man who had angered me, and thereupon thought, &#39;Come! I should like&#10;to deal him a blow, but can I actually do it?&#39; And strike him I&#10;did. Was it my fault? Always I keep asking myself, &#39;Can I, or can I&#10;not, do a thing?&#39; Aye, lost, lost am I!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Apparently this outburst caused the man to reach the end of his&#10;power, for presently he sank from knees to heels&#8212;then on to his&#10;side, with hands clasping his head, and his tongue finally uttering&#10;the words, &#34;Better had you kill me!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A hush fell, for all now stood confounded and silent, with,&#10;about them, a greyer, a more subdued, look which made all more&#10;resemble their fellows. In fact, to all had the atmosphere become&#10;oppressive, as though everyone&#39;s breast had had clamped into it a&#10;large, soft clod of humid, viscid earth. Until at last someone said&#10;in a low, shamefaced, but friendly, tone:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Good brother, we are not your judges.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;To which someone else added with an equal measure of&#10;gentleness:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Indeed, we may be no better than you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;We pity you, but we must not judge you. Only pity is&#10;permitted.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As for the well-dressed peasant, his loud, triumphant utterance&#10;was:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Let God judge him, but men suffer him. Of judging of one&#10;another there has been enough.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And a fifth man remarked to a friend as he walked away:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What are we to make of this? To judge by the book, the young&#10;fellow is at once guilty and not guilty.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Bygones ought to be bygones. Of all courses that is the&#10;best.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, for we are too quick. What good can that do?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Aye, what?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At length the dark-browed woman stepped forward. Letting her&#10;shawl to her shoulders, straightening hair streaked with grey under&#10;a bright blue scarf, and deftly putting aside a skirt she so seated&#10;herself beside the young fellow as to screen from the crowd with&#10;the height of her figure. Then, raising kindly face, she said&#10;civilly, but authoritatively, to the bystanders:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Do all of you go away.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Whereupon the crowd began to depart, the big peasant saying as&#10;he went:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;There! Just as I foretold has the matter turned out. Conscience&#10;HAS asserted itself.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Yet the words were spoken without self-complacency, rather,&#10;thoughtfully, and with a sense of awe.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As for the red-nosed old man who was walking like a shadow&#10;behind the last speaker, he opened his snuff-box, peered therein&#10;with his moist eyes, and drawled to no one in particular:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;How often does one see a man play with conscience, yes, even&#10;though he be a rogue! He erects that conscience as a screen to his&#10;knaveries and tricks and wiles, and masks the whole with a cloud of&#10;words. Yes, we know how it is done, even though folk may stare at&#10;him, and say to one another, &#39;How fervently his soul is glowing!&#39;&#10;Aye, all the time that he is holding his hand to his heart he will&#10;be dipping the other hand into your pocket.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The lover of proverbs, for his part, unbuttoned his jacket,&#10;thrust his hands under his coat-tails, and said in a loud&#10;voice:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;There is a saying that you can trust any wild beast, such as a&#10;fox or a hedgehog or a toad, but not&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Quite so, dear sir. The common folk are exceedingly&#10;degenerate.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well, they are not developing as they ought to do.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No, they are over-cramped,&#34; was the big peasant&#39;s rasped-out&#10;comment. &#34;They have no room for GROWTH.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, they DO grow, but only as regards beard and moustache, as&#10;a tree grows to branch and sap.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With a glance at the purveyor of proverbs the old man assented&#10;by remarking: &#34;Yes, true it is that the common folk are cramped.&#34;&#10;Whereafter he thrust a pinch of snuff into his nostrils, and threw&#10;back his head in anticipation of the sneeze which failed to come.&#10;At length, drawing a deep breath through his parted lips, he said&#10;as he measured the peasant again with his eyes:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My friend, you are of a sort calculated to last.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In answer the peasant nodded.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;SOME day,&#34; he remarked, &#34;we shall get what we want.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In front of us now, was Kazan, with the pinnacles of its&#10;churches and mosques piercing the blue sky, and looking like&#10;garlands of exotic blooms. Around them lay the grey wall of the&#10;Kremlin, and above them soared the grim Tower of Sumbek.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Here one and all were due to disembark.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I glanced towards the stern once more. The dark-browed woman was&#10;breaking off morsels from a wheaten scone that was lying in her&#10;lap, and saying as she did so:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Presently we will have a cup of tea, and then keep together as&#10;far as Christopol.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In response the young fellow edged nearer to her, and&#10;thoughtfully eyed the large hands which, though inured to hard&#10;work, could also be very gentle.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I have been trodden upon,&#34; he said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Trodden upon by whom?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;By all. And I am afraid of them.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why so?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Because I am.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Breathing upon a morsel of the scone, the woman offered it him&#10;with the quiet words:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You have had much to bear. Now, shall I tell you my history, or&#10;shall we first have tea?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;On the bank there was now to be seen the frontage of the gay,&#10;wealthy suburb of Uslon, with its brightly-dressed, rainbow-tinted&#10;women and girls tripping through the streets, and the water of its&#10;foaming river sparkling hotly, yet dimly, in the sunlight.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was a scene like a scene beheld in a vision.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 19, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/3920')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('A Woman'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;The wind is scudding over the steppe, and beating upon the&#10;rampart of the Caucasian heights until their backbone seems to be&#10;bellying like a huge sail, and the earth to be whirling and&#10;whizzing through unfathomable depths of blue, and leaving behind it&#10;a rack of wind-torn clouds which, as their shadows glide over the&#10;surface of the land, seem ever to be striving to keep in touch with&#10;the onrush of the gale, and, failing to maintain the effort,&#10;dissolving in tears and despondency.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The trees too are bending in the attitude of flight&#8212;their boughs&#10;are brandishing their foliage as a dog worries a fleece, and&#10;littering the black soil with leaves among which runs a constant&#10;querulous hissing and rustling. Also, storks are uttering their&#10;snapping cry, sleek rooks cawing, steppe grasshoppers maintaining&#10;their tireless chirp, sturdy, well-grown husbandmen uttering shouts&#10;like words of command, the threshing-floors of the rolling steppe&#10;diffusing a rain of golden chaff, and eddying whirlwinds catching&#10;up stray poultry feathers, dried-onion strips, and leaves yellowed&#10;with the heat, to send them dancing again over the trim square of&#10;the little Cossack hamlet.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Similarly does the sun keep appearing and disappearing as though&#10;he were pursuing the fugitive earth, and ever and anon halting&#10;through weariness before his decline into the dark, shadowy vista&#10;where the snowclad peaks of the western mountains are rearing their&#10;heads, and fast-reddening clouds are reminding one of the surface&#10;of a ploughed field.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At times those clouds part their bulk to reveal in blinding&#10;splendour the silvery saddle of Mount Elburz, and the crystal fangs&#10;of other peaks&#8212;all, apparently, striving to catch and detain the&#10;scudding vapours. And to such a point does one come to realise the&#10;earth&#39;s flight through space that one can scarcely draw one&#39;s&#10;breath for the tension, the rapture, of the thought that with the&#10;rush of that dear and beautiful earth oneself is keeping pace&#10;towards, and ever tending towards, the region where, behind the&#10;eternal, snow-clad peaks, there lies a boundless ocean of blue&#8212;an&#10;ocean beside which there may lie stretched yet other proud and&#10;marvellous lands, a void of azure amid which one may come to descry&#10;far-distant, many-tinted spheres of planets as yet unknown, but&#10;sisters, all, to this earth of ours.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Meanwhile from the steppe slow, ponderous grey oxen with sharp&#10;horns are drawing an endless succession of wagon-loads of threshed&#10;grain through rich, black, sootlike dust. Patiently the beasts&#39;&#10;round eyes regard the earth, while on the top of each load there&#10;lolls a Cossack who, with face sunburnt to the last pitch of&#10;swarthiness, and eyes reddened with exposure to the wind, and beard&#10;matted, seemingly solidified, with dust and sweat, is clad in a&#10;shirt drab with grime, and has a shaggy Persian cap thrust to the&#10;back of his head. Occasionally, also, he may be seen riding on the&#10;pole in front of his team, and being buffeted from behind by the&#10;wind which inflates his shirt. And as sleek and comfortable as the&#10;carcasses of the bullocks are these Cossacks&#39; frames in proportion&#10;their eyes are sluggishly intelligent, and in their every movement&#10;is the deliberate air of men who know precisely what they have to&#10;do.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Tsob, tsobe!&#34; such fellows shout to their teams. This year they&#10;are reaping a splendid harvest.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Yet though these folk, one and all, look fat and prosperous,&#10;their mien is dour, and they speak reluctantly, and through their&#10;teeth. Possibly this is because they are over-weary with toil.&#10;However that may be, the full-fed country people of the region&#10;laugh but little, and seldom sing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In the centre of the hamlet soars the red brick church of the&#10;place&#8212;an edifice which, with its five pinnacles, its belfry over&#10;its porch, and its yellow plaster window-mouldings, looks like an&#10;edifice that has been fashioned of meat, and cemented with grease.&#10;Nay, its very shadow seems so richly heavy as to be the shadow of a&#10;fane erected by men endowed with a plethora of this world&#39;s goods&#10;to a god otiose in his grandeur. Ranged around the building in ring&#10;fashion, the hamlet&#39;s squat white huts stand girdled with belts of&#10;plaited wattle, shawled in the gorgeous silken scarves of gardens,&#10;and crowned with a flowered brocadework of reed-thatched roofs. In&#10;fact, they resemble a bevy of buxom babi, [Peasant women] as over&#10;and about them wave silver poplar trees, with quivering, lacelike&#10;leaves of acacias, and dark-leaved chestnuts (the leaves of the&#10;latter like the palms of human hands) which rock to and fro as&#10;though they would fain seize, and detain the driving clouds. Also,&#10;from court to court scurry Cossack women who, with skirt-tails&#10;tucked up to reveal muscular legs bare to the knee, are preparing&#10;to array themselves for the morrow&#39;s festival, and, meanwhile,&#10;chattering to one another, or shouting to plump infants which may&#10;be seen bathing in the dust like sparrows, or picking up handfuls&#10;of sand, and tossing them into the air.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Sheltered from the wind by the churchyard wall, there may be&#10;seen also, as they sprawl on the dry, faded herbage, a score of&#10;&#34;strollers for work&#34; that is to say, of folk who, a community&#10;apart, consist of &#34;nowhere people,&#34; of dreamers who live constantly&#10;in expectation of some stroke of luck, some kindly smile from&#10;fortune, and of wastrels who, intoxicated with the abundant bounty&#10;of the opulent region, have fallen passive victims to the Russian&#10;craze for vagrancy. These folk tramp from hamlet to hamlet in&#10;parties of two or three, and, while purporting to seek employment,&#10;merely contemplate that employment lethargically, express&#10;astonishment at the plenitude which it produces, and then decline&#10;to put their hands to toil save when dire necessity renders it no&#10;longer possible to satisfy hunger&#39;s pangs through the expedients of&#10;mendicancy and theft. Dull, or cowed, or timid, or furtive of eye,&#10;these folk have lost all sense of the difference between that which&#10;constitutes honesty and that which does not.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The morrow being the Feast of the Assumption, these people have,&#10;in the present instance, gathered from every quarter of the&#10;country, for the reason that they hope to be provided with food and&#10;drink without first being made to earn their entertainment.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For the most part they are Russians from the central provinces,&#10;vagabonds whose faces are blackened, and heads blanched with the&#10;unaccustomed sunshine of the South, but whose bodies are clad&#10;merely in rags tossed and tumbled by the wind. True, the wearers of&#10;those rags declare themselves to be peaceful, respectable citizens&#10;whom toil and life&#39;s buffetings have exhausted, and compelled to&#10;seek temporary rest and prayer; yet never does a creaking,&#10;groaning, ponderous grain wagon, with its Cossack driver, pass them&#10;by without their according the latter a humble, obsequious salute&#10;as, with straw in mouth, and omitting, always, to raise his cap,&#10;the man glances at them askance and with contempt, or, more&#10;frequently, does not even descry these tattered, grimy hulks&#10;between whom and himself there is absolutely nothing in common.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Lower even, and more noticeably, more pretentiously, than the&#10;rest does a certain &#34;needy&#34; native of Tula named Konev salute each&#10;Cossack. A hardbitten muzhik as sunburnt as a stick of ergot, he&#10;has a black beard distributed irregularly over a lean face, a&#10;fawning smile, and eyes deep-sunken in their sockets.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Most of these persons I have met for the first time today; but&#10;Konev is an old acquaintance of mine, for he and I have more than&#10;once encountered one another on the road between Kursk and the&#10;province of Ter. An &#34;artelni,&#34; that is to say, a member of a&#10;workman&#39;s union, he cultivates his fellows&#39; good graces for the&#10;reason that he is also an arrant coward, and accustomed, everywhere&#10;save in his own village (which lies buried among the sands of&#10;Alexin), to assert that:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Certainly, this countryside is rich, yet I cannot hit things&#10;off with its inhabitants. In my own part of the country folk are&#10;more spiritual, more truly Russian, by far than here&#8212;they are folk&#10;with whom the natives of this region are not to be compared, since&#10;in the one locality the population has a human soul, whereas in the&#10;other locality it is a flint-stone.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And with a certain quiet reflectiveness, he loves also to&#10;recount a marvellous example of unlooked-for enrichment. He will&#10;say to you:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Maybe you do not believe in the virtue of horseshoes? Yet I&#10;tell YOU that once, when a certain peasant of Efremov found a&#10;horseshoe, the next three weeks saw it befall that that peasant&#39;s&#10;uncle, a tradesman of Efremov, was burnt to death with all his&#10;family, and the property devolved to the peasant. Did you ever hear&#10;of such a thing? What is going to happen CANNOT be foretold, for at&#10;any moment fortune may pity a man, and send him a windfall.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As Konev says this his dark, pointed eyebrows will go shooting&#10;up his forehead, and his eyes come protruding out of their sockets,&#10;as though he himself cannot believe what he has just related.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Again, should a Cossack pass him without returning his salute,&#10;he will mutter as he follows the man with his eyes:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;An overfed fellow, that&#8212;a fellow who can&#39;t even look at a human&#10;being! The souls of these folk, I tell you, are withered.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;On the present occasion he has arrived on the scene in company&#10;with two women. One of them, aged about twenty, is gentle-looking,&#10;plump, and glassy of eye, with a mouth perpetually half-open, so&#10;that the face looks like that of an imbecile, and though the&#10;exposed teeth of its lower portion may seem to be set in a smile,&#10;you will perceive, should you peer into the motionless eyes under&#10;the overhanging brows, that she has recently been weeping in the&#10;terrified, hysterical fashion of a person of weak intellect.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I have come here with that man and other strangers thus I heard&#10;her narrate in low, querulous tones as with a stumpy finger she&#10;rearranged the faded hair under her yellow and green scarf.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A fat-faced youth with high cheek-bones and the small eyes of a&#10;Mongol here nudged her, and said carelessly:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You mean, rather, that your own man has cast you off. Probably&#10;he was the only man you ever saw.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Aye,&#34; Konev drawled thoughtfully as he felt in his wallet.&#10;&#34;Nowadays folk need think little of deserting a woman, since in&#10;this year of grace women are no good at all.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Upon this the woman frowned&#8212;then blinked her eyes timidly, and&#10;would have opened her lips to reply, but that her companion&#10;interrupted her by saying in a brisk, incisive tone:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Do not listen to those rascals!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The woman&#39;s companion, some five or six years her senior, has a&#10;face exceptional in the constant change and movement of its great&#10;dark eyes as at one moment they withdraw themselves from the street&#10;of the Cossack hamlet, to gaze fixedly and gravely towards the&#10;steppe where it lies scoured with the scudding breeze, and at&#10;another moment fall to scanning the faces of the persons around&#10;her, and, at another, frown anxiously, or send a smile flitting&#10;across her comely lips as she bends her head, until her features&#10;are concealed. Next, the head is raised again, for the eyes have&#10;taken on another phase, and become dilated with interest, while a&#10;sharp furrow is forming between the slender eyebrows, and the&#10;finely moulded lips and trim mouth have compressed themselves&#10;together, and the thin nostrils of the straight nose are snuffing&#10;the air like those of a horse.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In fact, in the woman there is something non-peasant in its&#10;origin. For instance, let one but watch her sharply clicking feet&#10;as, in walking, they peep from under her blue skirt, and one will&#10;perceive that they are not the splayed feet of a villager, but,&#10;rather, feet arched of instep, and at one time accustomed to the&#10;wearing of boots. Or, as the woman sits engaged in embroidering a&#10;blue bodice with a pattern of white peas, one will perceive that&#10;she has long been accustomed to plying the needle so dexterously;&#10;swiftly do the small, sunburnt hands fly in and out under the&#10;tumbled material, eagerly though the wind may strive to wrest it&#10;from her. Again, as she sits bending over her work, one will descry&#10;through a rent in her bodice a small, firm bosom which might almost&#10;have been that of a virgin, were it not for the fact that a&#10;projecting teat proclaims that she is a woman preparing to suckle&#10;an infant. In short, as she sits among her companions she looks&#10;like a fragment of copper flung into the midst of some rusty old&#10;scrap-iron.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Most of the people in whose society I wander neither rise to&#10;great heights nor sink to great depths, but are as colourless as&#10;dust, and wearisomely insignificant. Hence is it that whenever I&#10;chance upon a person whose soul I can probe and explore for&#10;thoughts unfamiliar to me and words not hitherto heard I&#10;congratulate myself, seeing that though it is my desire to see life&#10;grow more fair and exalted, and I yearn to bring about that end,&#10;there constantly reveals itself to me merely a vista of sharp&#10;angles and dark spaces and poor crushed, defrauded people. Yes,&#10;never do I seek to project a spark of my own fire into the darkness&#10;of my neighbour&#39;s soul but I see that spark disappear, become lost,&#10;in a chaos of dumb vacuity.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Hence the woman of whom I have just spoken particularly excites&#10;my fancy, and leads me to attempt divinations of her past, until I&#10;find myself evolving a story which is not only of vast complexity,&#10;but has got painted into it merely the colours of my own hopes and&#10;aspirations. It is a story necessarily illusory, necessarily bound&#10;to make life seem even worse than before. Yet it is a grievous&#10;thing NEVER to distort actuality, NEVER to envelop actuality in the&#10;wrappings of one&#39;s imagination&#8230; .&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Closing his eyes, and picking his words with difficulty, a tall,&#10;fair peasant drawls in thick, gluelike tones:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;&#39;Very well,&#39; I said: and off we set. On the way I said again:&#10;&#39;Gubin, though you may not like to be told so, you are no better&#10;than a thief.&#39;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The o&#39;s uttered by this peasant are uniformly round and&#10;firm&#8212;they roll forward as a cartwheel trundles along a hot, dusty&#10;country road.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The youth with the high cheek-bones fixes the whites of his&#10;porcine eyes (eyes the pupils of which are as indeterminate as the&#10;eyes of a blind man) upon the woman in the green scarf. Then,&#10;having, like a calf, plucked and chewed some stalks of the withered&#10;grass, he rolls up the sleeves of his shirt, bends one fist into&#10;the crook of the elbow, and says to Konev with a glance at the&#10;well-developed muscle:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Should you care to hit me?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No, you can hit yourself. Hit yourself over the head. Then,&#10;perhaps, you&#39;ll grow wiser.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Stolidly the young fellow looks at Konev, and inquires:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;How do you know me to be a fool?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Because your personality tells me so.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Eh?&#34; cries the young fellow truculently as he raises himself to&#10;a kneeling posture. &#34;How know you what I am?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I have been told what you are by the Governor of your&#10;province.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The young fellow opens his mouth, and stares at Konev. Then he&#10;asks:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;To what province do I belong?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;If you yourself have forgotten to what province you belong, you&#10;had better try and loosen your wits.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Look here. If I were to hit you, I&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The woman who has been sewing drops her work to shrug one&#10;rounded shoulder as though she were cold, and ask&#10;conciliatorily:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well, WHAT province do you belong to?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I?&#34; the young fellow re-echoes as he subsides on to his heels.&#10;&#34;I belong to Penza. Why do you ask?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh never mind why.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Presently, with a strangely youthful laugh, the woman adds in a&#10;murmur:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I ask because I too belong to that province.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And to which canton?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;To that of Penza.&#34; In the woman&#39;s tone is a touch of pride.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The young fellow squats down before her, as before a wood fire,&#10;stretches out his hands, and says in an ingratiating voice:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What a fine place is our cantonal town! What churches and shops&#10;and stone houses there are in it! In fact, one shop sells a machine&#10;on which you can play anything you like, any sort of a tune!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;As well as, probably, the fool,&#34; comments Konev in an&#10;undertone, though the young fellow is too enthralled with the&#10;memory of the amenities of his cantonal capital to notice the&#10;remark. Next, smacking his lips, and chewing his words, he&#10;continues in a murmur:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;In those stone houses.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Here the woman drops her sewing a second time to inquire: &#34;Is&#10;there a convent there?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;A convent?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And the young fellow pauses uncouthly to scratch his neck. Only&#10;after a while does he answer:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;A convent? Well, I do not know, for only once, to tell the&#10;truth, have I been in the town, and that was when some of us famine&#10;folk were set to a job of roadmaking.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well, well!&#34; gasps Konev, as he rises and takes his&#10;departure.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The vagabonds, huddled against the churchyard wall, look like&#10;litter driven thither by the steppe wind, and as liable to be&#10;whirled away again whenever the wind shall choose. Three of the&#10;party are sleeping, and the remainder either mending their&#10;clothing, or killing fleas, or lethargically munching bread&#10;collected at the windows of the Cossacks&#39; huts. I find the sight of&#10;them weary me as much as does the young fellows fatuous babble.&#10;Also, I find that whenever the elder of the two women lifts her&#10;eyes from her work, and half smiles, the faint half-smile in&#10;question vexes me intensely. Consequently, I end by departing in&#10;Konev&#39;s wake.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Guarding the entrance of the churchyard, four poplar trees stand&#10;erect, save when, as the wind harries them, they bow alternately to&#10;the arid, dusty earth and towards the dim vista of tow-coloured&#10;steppe and snowcapped mountain peaks. Yet, oh how that steppe,&#10;bathed in golden sunshine, draws one to itself and its smooth&#10;desolation of sweet, dry grasses as the parched, fragrant expanse&#10;rustles under the soughing wind!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You ask about that woman, eh?&#34; queries Konev, whom I find&#10;leaning against one of the poplar trunks, and embracing it with an&#10;arm.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes. From where does she hail?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;From Riazan, she says. Another story of hers is that her name&#10;is Tatiana.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Has she been with you long?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No. In fact, it was only this morning, some thirty versts from&#10;here, that I overtook her and her companion. However, I have seen&#10;her before, at Maikop-on-Laba, during the season of hay harvest,&#10;when she had with her an elderly, smoothfaced muzhik who might have&#10;been a soldier, and certainly was either her lover or an uncle, as&#10;well as a bully and a drunkard of the type which, before it has&#10;been two days in a place, starts about as many brawls. At present,&#10;however, she is tramping with none but this female companion, for,&#10;after that the &#39;uncle&#39; had drunk away his very belly-band and&#10;reins, he was clapped in gaol. The Cossack, you know, is an awkward&#10;person to deal with.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Although Konev speaks without constraint, his eyes are fixed&#10;upon the ground in a manner suggestive of some disturbing thought.&#10;And as the breeze ruffles his dishevelled beard and ragged&#10;pea-jacket it ends by robbing his head of his cap&#8212;of the tattered,&#10;peakless clout which, with rents in its lining, so closely&#10;resembles a tchepchik [Woman&#39;s mob-cap], as to communicate to the&#10;picturesque features of its wearer an appearance comically&#10;feminine.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ye-es,&#34; expectorating, and drawling the words between his&#10;teeth, he continues: &#34;She is a remarkable woman, a regular, so to&#10;speak, highstepper. Yet it must have been the Devil himself that&#10;blew this young oaf with the bloated jowl on to the scene.&#10;Otherwise I should soon have fixed up matters with her. The cur&#10;that he is!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But once you told me that you had a wife already?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Darting at me an angry glance, he turns away with a mutter&#10;of:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;AM I to carry my wife about with me in my wallet?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Here there comes limping across the square a moustachioed&#10;Cossack. In one hand he is holding a bunch of keys, and in the&#10;other hand a battered Cossack cap, peak in front. Behind him,&#10;sobbing and applying his knuckles to his eyes, there is creeping a&#10;curly-headed urchin of eight, while the rear is brought up by a&#10;shaggy dog whose dejected countenance and lowered tail would seem&#10;to show that he too is in disgrace. Each time that the boy whimpers&#10;more loudly than usual the Cossack halts, awaits the lad&#39;s coming&#10;in silence, cuffs him over the head with the peak of the cap, and,&#10;resuming his way with the gait of a drunken man, leaves the boy and&#10;the dog standing where they are&#8212;the boy lamenting, and the dog&#10;wagging its tail as its old black muzzle sniffs the air. Somehow I&#10;discern in the dog&#39;s mien of holding itself prepared for anything&#10;that may turn up, a certain resemblance to Konev&#39;s bearing, save&#10;that the dog is older in appearance than is the vagabond.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You mentioned my wife, I think?&#34; presently he resumes with a&#10;sigh. &#34;Yes, I know, but not EVERY malady proves mortal, and I have&#10;been married nineteen years!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The rest is well-known to me, for all too frequently have I&#10;heard it and similar tales. Unfortunately, I cannot now take the&#10;trouble to stop him; so once more I am forced to let his complaints&#10;come oozing tediously into my ears.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The wench was plump,&#34; says Konev, &#34;and panting for love; so we&#10;just got married, and brats began to come tumbling from her like&#10;bugs from a bunk.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Subsiding a little, the breeze takes, as it were, to&#10;whispering.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;In fact, I could scarcely turn round for them. Even now seven&#10;of them are alive, though originally the stud numbered thirteen.&#10;And what was the use of such a gang? For, consider: my wife is&#10;forty-two, and I am forty-three. She is elderly, and I am what you&#10;behold. True, hitherto I have contrived to keep up my spirits; yet&#10;poverty is wearing me down, and when, last winter, my old woman&#10;went to pieces I set forth (for what else could I do?) to tour the&#10;towns. In fact, folk like you and myself have only one job&#10;available&#8212;the job of licking one&#39;s chops, and keeping one&#39;s eyes&#10;open. Yet, to tell you the truth, I no sooner perceive myself to be&#10;growing superfluous in a place than I spit upon that place, and&#10;clear out of it.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Never to this sturdy, inveterate rascal does it seem to occur to&#10;insinuate that he has been doing work of any kind, or that he in&#10;the least cares to do any; while at the same time all self-pity is&#10;eschewed in his narrative, and he relates his experiences much as&#10;though they are the experiences of another man, and not of&#10;himself.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Presently, as the Cossack and the boy draw level with us, the&#10;former, fingering his moustache, inquires thickly:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Whence are you come?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;From Russia.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;All such folk come from there.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Thereafter, with a gesture of disdain, this man of the&#10;abnormally broad nose, eyes floating in fat, and flaxen head shaped&#10;like a flounder&#39;s, resumes his way towards the porch of the church.&#10;As for the boy, he wipes his nose and follows him while the dog&#10;sniffs at our legs, yawns, and stretches itself by the churchyard&#10;wall.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Did you see?&#34; mutters Konev. &#34;Oh yes, I tell you that the folk&#10;here are far less amiable than our own folk in Russia&#8230; But hark!&#10;What is that?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;To our ears there have come from behind the corner of the&#10;churchyard wall a woman&#39;s scream and the sound of dull blows.&#10;Rushing thither, we behold the fair-headed peasant seated on the&#10;prostrate form of the young fellow from Penza, and methodically,&#10;gruntingly delivering blow after blow upon the young fellow&#39;s ears&#10;with his ponderous fists, while counting the blows as he does so.&#10;Vainly, at the same time, the woman from Riazan is prodding the&#10;assailant in the back, whilst her female companion is shrieking,&#10;and the crowd at large has leapt to its feet, and, collected into a&#10;knot, is shouting gleefully, &#34;THAT&#39;S the way! THAT&#39;S the way!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Five!&#34; the fair-headed peasant counts.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why are you doing this?&#34; the prostrate man protests.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Six!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh dear!&#34; ejaculates Konev, dancing with nervousness. &#34;Oh dear,&#10;oh dear!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The smacking, smashing blows fall in regular cadence as, prone&#10;on his face, the young fellow kicks, struggles and puffs up the&#10;dust. Meanwhile a tall, dour man in a straw hat is rolling up a&#10;shirt-sleeve, and alternately bending and stretching a long arm,&#10;whilst a lithe, white-headed young stripling is hopping,&#10;sparrow-like, from one onlooker to another, and exclaiming in&#10;suppressed, cautious tones:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Stop it, pray stop it, or we shall be arrested for creating a&#10;disturbance!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Presently the tall man strides towards the fair-headed peasant,&#10;deals him a single blow which knocks him from the back of the young&#10;fellow, and, turning to the crowd, says with an informing air:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;THAT&#39;S how we do it in Tambov!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Brutes! Villains!&#34; screams the woman from Riazan, as she bends&#10;over the young fellow. Her cheeks are livid, and as she wipes the&#10;flushed face of the beaten youth with the hem of her gown, her dark&#10;eyes are flashing with dry wrath, and her lips quivering so&#10;painfully as to disclose a set of fine, level teeth.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Konev, pecking up to her, says with an air of advice:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You had better take him away, and give him some water.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Upon this the fair-headed muzhik, rising to his knees, stretches&#10;a fist towards the man from Tambov, and exclaims:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why should he have gone and bragged of his strength, pray?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Was that a good reason for thrashing him?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And who are you?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Who am I?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, who are YOU?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Never mind. See that I don&#39;t give you another swipe!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Upon this the onlookers plunge into a heated debate as to who&#10;was actually the beginner of the disturbance, while the lithe young&#10;fellow continues to wring his hands, and cry imploringly:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;DON&#39;T make so much noise about it! Remember that we are in a&#10;strange land, and that the folk hereabouts are strict.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So queerly do his ears project from his head that he would seem&#10;to be able, if he pleased, to fold them right over his eyes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Suddenly from the roseate heavens comes the vibrant note of a&#10;bell; whereupon, the hubbub ceases and at the same moment a young&#10;Cossack with a face studded with freckles, and, in his hands, a&#10;cudgel, makes his appearance among the crowd.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What does all this mean?&#34; he inquires not uncivilly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;They have been beating a man,&#34; the woman from Riazan replies.&#10;As she does so she looks comely in spite of her wrath.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Cossack glances at her&#8212;then smiles.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And where is the party going to sleep?&#34; he inquires of the&#10;crowd.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Here,&#34; someone ventures.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Then you must not&#8212;someone might break into the church. Go,&#10;rather, to the Ataman [Cossack headman or mayor], and you will be&#10;billeted among the huts.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It is a matter of no consequence,&#34; Konev remarks as he paces&#10;beside me. &#34;Yet&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;They seem to be taking us for robbers,&#34; is my interruption.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;As is everywhere the way,&#34; he comments. &#34;It is but one thing&#10;more laid to our charge. Caution decides always that a stranger is&#10;a thief.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In front of us walks the woman from Riazan, in company with the&#10;young fellow of the bloated features. He is downcast of mien, and&#10;at length mutters something which I cannot catch, but in answer to&#10;which she tosses her head, and says in a distinct, maternal&#10;tone:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You are too young to associate with such brutes.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The bell of the church is slowly beating, and from the huts&#10;there keep coming neat old men and women who make the hitherto&#10;deserted street assume a brisk appearance, and the squat huts take&#10;on a welcoming air.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In a resonant, girlish voice there meets our ears:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ma-am! Ma-amka! Where is the key of the green box? I want my&#10;ribands!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;While in answer to the bell&#39;s summons, the oxen low a deep&#10;echo.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The wind has fallen, but reddish clouds still are gliding over&#10;the hamlet, and the mountain peaks blushing until they seem,&#10;thawing, to be sending streams of golden, liquid fire on to the&#10;steppes, where, as though cast in stone, a stork, standing on one&#10;leg, is listening, seemingly, to the rustling of the heat-exhausted&#10;herbage.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In the forecourt of the Ataman&#39;s hut we are deprived of our&#10;passports, while two of our number, found to be without such&#10;documents, are led away to a night&#39;s lodging in a dark storehouse&#10;in a corner of the premises. Everything is executed quietly enough,&#10;and without the least fuss, purely as a matter of routine; yet&#10;Konev mutters, as dejectedly he contemplates the darkening sky:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What a surprising thing, to be sure!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What is?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;A passport. Surely a decent, peaceable man ought to be able to&#10;travel WITHOUT a passport? So long as he be harmless, let him&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You are not harmless,&#34; with angry emphasis the woman from&#10;Riazan interposes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Konev closes his eyes with a smile, and says nothing more.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Almost until the vigil service is over are we kept kicking our&#10;heels about that forecourt, like sheep in a slaughter-house. Then&#10;Konev, myself, the two women, and the fat-faced young fellow are&#10;led away towards the outskirts of the village, and allotted an&#10;empty hut with broken-down walls and a cracked window.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No going out will be permitted,&#34; says the Cossack who has&#10;conducted us thither. &#34;Else you will be arrested.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Then give us a morsel of bread,&#34; Konev says with a stammer.&#10;&#34;Have you done any work here?&#34; the Cossack inquires.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes&#8212;a little.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;For me?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No. It did not so happen.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;When it does so happen I will give you some bread.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And like a water-butt the fat kindly-looking man goes rolling&#10;out of the yard.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What else was to be expected?&#34; grumbles Konev with his eyebrows&#10;elevated to the middle of his forehead. &#34;The folk hereabouts are&#10;knaves. Ah, well!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As for the women, they withdraw to the darkest corner of the&#10;hut, and lie down, while the young fellow disappears after probing&#10;the walls and floor, and returns with an armful of straw which he&#10;strews upon the hard, beaten clay. Then he stretches himself&#10;thereon with hands clasped behind his battered head.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;See the resourcefulness of that fellow from Penza!&#34; comments&#10;Konev enviously. &#34;Hi, you women! There is, it would seem, some&#10;straw about.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;To this comes from the women&#39;s corner the acid reply:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Then go and fetch some.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;For you?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, for us.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Then I must, I suppose.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Nevertheless Konev merely remains sitting on the windowsill, and&#10;discoursing on the subject of certain needy folk who do but desire&#10;to go and say their prayers in church, yet are banded into&#10;barns.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, and though you may say that folk, the world over, have a&#10;soul in common, I tell you that this is not so&#8212;that, on the&#10;contrary, we Russian strangers find it a hard matter here to get&#10;looked upon as respectable.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With which he slips out quietly into the street, and disappears&#10;from view.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The young fellow&#39;s sleep is restless&#8212;he keeps tossing about,&#10;with his fat arms and legs sprawling over the floor, and grunting,&#10;and snoring. Under him the straw makes a crackling sound, while the&#10;two women whisper together in the darkness, and the reeds of the&#10;dry thatch on the roof rustle (the wind is still drawing an&#10;occasional breath), and ever and anon a twig brushes against an&#10;outside wall. The scene is like a scene in a dream.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Out of doors the myriad tongues of the pitch-black, starless&#10;night seem to be debating something in soft, sad, pitiful tones&#10;which ever keep growing fainter; until, when the hour of ten has&#10;been struck on the watchman&#39;s gong, and the metal ceases to&#10;vibrate, the world grows quieter still, much as though all living&#10;things, alarmed by the clang in the night, have concealed&#10;themselves in the invisible earth or the equally invisible&#10;heavens.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I seat myself by the window, and watch how the earth keeps&#10;exhaling darkness, and the darkness enveloping, drowning the grey,&#10;blurred huts in black, tepid vapour, though the church remains&#10;invisible&#8212;evidently something stands interposed between it and my&#10;viewpoint. And it seems to me that the wind, the seraph of many&#10;pinions which has spent three days in harrying the land, must now&#10;have whirled the earth into a blackness, a denseness, in which,&#10;exhausted, and panting, and scarcely moving, it is helplessly&#10;striving to remain within the encompassing, all-pervading obscurity&#10;where, helpless and weary in like degree, the wind has sloughed its&#10;thousands of wing-feathers&#8212;feathers white and blue and golden of&#10;tint, but also broken, and smeared with dust and blood.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And as I think of our petty, grievous human life, as of a&#10;drunkard&#39;s tune on a sorry musical instrument, or as of a beautiful&#10;song spoilt by a witless, voiceless singer, there begins to wail in&#10;my soul an insatiable longing to breathe forth words of sympathy&#10;with all mankind, words of burning love for all the world, words of&#10;appreciation of, for example, the sun&#39;s beauty as, enfolding the&#10;earth in his beams, and caressing and fertilising her, he bears her&#10;through the expanses of blue. Yes, I yearn to recite to my&#10;fellow-men words which shall raise their heads. And at length I&#10;find myself compounding the following jejune lines:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p class=&#34;poem&#34;&#62;To our land we all are born&#60;br /&#62;&#10;In happiness to dwell.&#60;br /&#62;&#10;The sun has bred us to this land&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Its fairness to excel.&#60;br /&#62;&#10;In the temple of the sun&#60;br /&#62;&#10;We high priests are, divine.&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Then each of us should claim his life,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;And cry, &#34;This life is mine!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Meanwhile from the women&#39;s corner there comes a soft,&#10;intermittent whispering; and as it continues to filter through the&#10;darkness, I strain my ears until I succeed in catching a few of the&#10;words uttered, and can distinguish at least the voices of the&#10;whisperers.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The woman from Riazan mutters firmly, and with assurance:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Never ought you to show that it hurts you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And with a sniff, in a tone of dubious acquiescence, her&#10;companion replies:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ye-es-so long as one can bear it.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ah, but never mind. PRETEND. That is to say, when he beats you,&#10;make light of it, and treat it as a joke.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But what if he beats me very much indeed?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Continue still to make light of it, still to smile at him&#10;kindly.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well, YOU can never have been beaten, for you do not seem to&#10;know what it is like.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh, but I have, my dear&#8212;I do know what it is like, for my&#10;experience of it has been large. Do not be afraid, however. HE&#10;won&#39;t beat you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A dog yelps, pauses a moment to listen, and then barks more&#10;angrily than ever. Upon that other dogs reply, and for a moment or&#10;two I am annoyed to find that I cannot overhear the women&#39;s&#10;conversation. In time, however, the dogs cease their uproar, for&#10;want of breath, and the suppressed dialogue filters once more to my&#10;ears.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Never forget, my dear, that a muzhik&#39;s life is a hard one. Yes,&#10;for us plain folk life is hard. Hence, one ought to make nothing of&#10;things, and let them come easy to one.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Mother of God!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And particularly should a woman so face things; for upon her&#10;everything depends. For one thing, let her take to herself, in&#10;place of her mother, a husband or a sweetheart. Yes, try that, and&#10;see. And though, at first, your husband may find fault with you, he&#10;will afterwards take to boasting to other muzhiks that he has a&#10;wife who can do everything, and remain ever as bright and loving as&#10;the month of May. Never does she give in; never WOULD she give&#10;in&#8212;no, not if you were to cut off her head!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Indeed?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes. And see if that will not come to be your opinion as much&#10;as mine.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Again, to my annoyance, the dialogue is interrupted&#8212;this time by&#10;the sound of uncertain footsteps in the street without. Thus the&#10;next words of the women&#39;s conversation escape me. Then I hear:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Have you ever read &#39;The Vision of the Mother of God&#39;?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;N-no, I have not.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Then you had better ask some older woman than myself to tell&#10;you about it, for it is a good book to become acquainted with. Can&#10;you read?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No, I cannot. But tell me, yourself, what the vision was?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Listen, and I will do so.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;From outside the window Konev&#39;s voice softly inquires:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Is that our lot in there? Yes? Thank God, then, for I had&#10;nearly lost my way after stirring up a lot of dogs, and being&#10;forced to use my fists upon them. Here, you! Catch hold!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With which, handing me a large watermelon, he clambers through&#10;the window with a great clattering and disturbance.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I have managed also to gee a good supply of bread,&#34; he&#10;continues. &#34;Perhaps you believe that I stole it? But no. Indeed,&#10;why should one steal when one can beg-a game at which I am&#10;particularly an old hand, seeing that always, on any occasion, I&#10;can make up to people? It happened like this. When I went out I saw&#10;a fire glowing in a hut, and folk seated at supper. And since,&#10;wherever many people are present, one of them at least has a kind&#10;heart, I ate and drank my fill, and then managed to make off with&#10;provender for you as well. Hi, you women!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There follows no answer.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I believe those daughters of whores must be asleep,&#34; he&#10;comments. &#34;Hi, women!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What is it?&#34; drily inquires the woman from Riazan.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Should you like a taste of water-melon?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I should, thank you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Thereupon, Konev begins to make his way towards the voice.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, bread, soft wheaten bread such as you&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Here the other woman whines in beggar fashion:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And give ME a taste, too.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh, yes, I will. But where the devil are you?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And a taste of melon as well?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, certainly. Hullo! Who is this?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;From the woman from Riazan comes a cry of pain.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Mind how you step, wretch!&#34; she exclaims.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;All right, but you needn&#39;t make so much noise about it. You see&#10;how dark it is, and I&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You ought to have struck a match, then.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I possess but a quarter of a match, for matches are not&#10;over-plentiful, and even if I did catch hold of you no great harm&#10;can have been done. For instance, when your husband used to beat&#10;you he must have hurt you far worse than I. By the way, DID he beat&#10;you?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What business is that of yours?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;None; only, I am curious to know. Surely a woman like you&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;See here. Do not dare to touch me, or I&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Or you what?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There ensues a prolonged altercation amid which I can hear&#10;epithets of increasing acerbity and opprobrium being applied; until&#10;the woman from Riazan exclaims hoarsely:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh, you coward of a man, take that!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Whereupon follows a scrimmage amid which I can distinguish&#10;slappings, gross chuckles from Konev, and a muffled cry from the&#10;younger woman of:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh, do not so behave, you wretch!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Striking a match, I approach the spot, and pull Konev away. He&#10;is in no way abashed, but merely cooled in his ardour as, seated on&#10;the floor at my feet, and panting and expectorating, he says&#10;reprovingly to the woman:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;When folk wish merely to have a game with you, you ought not to&#10;let yourself lose your temper. Fie, fie!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Are you hurt?&#34; the woman inquires quietly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What do you suppose? You have cut my lip, but that is the worst&#10;damage.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Then if you come here again I will lay the whole of your face&#10;open.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Vixen! What bumpkinish stupidity!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Konev turns to myself.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And as for you, you go catching at the first thing you find,&#10;and have torn my coat.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Then do not insult people.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;INSULT people, fool? The idea of anyone insulting a woman like&#10;THAT!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Whereafter, with a mean chuckle, the fellow goes on to discourse&#10;upon the ease with which peasant women err, and upon their love of&#10;deceiving their husbands.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The impudent rascal!&#34; comments the woman from Penza&#10;sleepily.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;After a while the young fellow springs to his feet, and grates&#10;his teeth. Then, reseating himself, and clutching at his head, he&#10;says gloomily:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I intend to leave here tomorrow, and go home. I do not care&#10;WHAT becomes of me.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With which he subsides on to the floor as though exhausted.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The blockhead!&#34; is Konev&#39;s remark.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Amid the darkness a black shape rises. It does so as soundlessly&#10;as a fish in a pond, glides to the door, and disappears.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That was she,&#34; remarks Konev. &#34;What a strong woman! However, if&#10;you had not pulled me away, I should have got the better of her. By&#10;God I should!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Then follow her, and make another attempt.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No,&#34; after a moment&#39;s reflection he rejoins. &#34;Out there she&#10;might get hold of a stick, or a brick, or some such thing. However,&#10;I&#39;LL get even with her. As a matter of fact, you wasted your time&#10;in stopping me, for she detests me like the very devil.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And he renews his wearisome boastings of his conquests; until&#10;suddenly, he stops as though he has swallowed his tongue.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;All becomes quiet; everything seems to have come to a halt, and&#10;to be pressing close in sleep to the motionless earth. I too grow&#10;drowsy, and have a vision amid which my mind returns to the&#10;donations which I have received that day, and sees them swell and&#10;multiply and increase in weight until I feel their bulk pressing&#10;upon me like a tumulus of the steppes. Next, the coppery notes of a&#10;bell jar in my ears, and, struck at random intervals, go floating&#10;away into the darkness.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It is the hour of midnight.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Soon, scattered drops of rain begin to patter down upon the dry&#10;thatch of the hut and the dust in the street outside, while a&#10;cricket continues chirping as though it were hurriedly relating a&#10;tale. Also, I hear filtering forth into the darkness a softly&#10;gulped, eager whispering.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Think,&#34; says one of the voices, &#34;what it must mean to have to&#10;go tramping about without work, or only with work for another to&#10;do!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The young fellow who has been so soundly thrashed replies in a&#10;dull voice:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I know nothing of you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;More softly, more softly!&#34; urges the woman.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What is it you want?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I want NOTHING. It is merely that I am sorry for you as a man&#10;yet young and strong. You see&#8212;well, I have not lived with my eyes&#10;shut. That is why I say, come with me.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But come whither?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;To the coast, where I know there to be beautiful plots of land&#10;for the asking. You yourself can see how good the land hereabout&#10;is. Well, there land better still is to be obtained.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Liar!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;More softly, more softly!&#34; again urges the woman. &#34;Moreover, I&#10;am not bad-looking, and can manage things well, and do any sort of&#10;work. Hence you and I might live quite peacefully and happily, and&#10;come, eventually, to have a place of our own. Yes, and I could bear&#10;and rear you a child. Only see how fit I am. Only feel this breast&#10;of mine.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The young fellow snorts, and I begin to find the situation&#10;oppressive, and to long to let the couple know that I am not&#10;asleep. Curiosity, however, prevents me, and I continue listening&#10;to the strange, arresting dialogue.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Wait a little,&#34; whispers the woman with a gasp. &#34;Do not play&#10;with me, for I am not that sort of woman. Yes, I mean what I say.&#10;Let be!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Rudely, roughly the young fellow replies:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Then don&#39;t run after me. A woman who runs after a man, and&#10;plays the whore with him, is&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Less noise, please&#8212;less noise, I beg of you, or we shall be&#10;heard, and I shall be put to shame!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Doesn&#39;t it put you to shame to be offering yourself to me like&#10;this?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A silence ensues, save that the young fellow goes on snorting&#10;and fidgeting, and the raindrops continue to fall with the same&#10;reluctance, the same indolence, as ever. Then once more the woman&#39;s&#10;voice is heard through the pattering.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Perhaps,&#34; says the voice, &#34;you have guessed that I am seeking a&#10;husband? Yes, I AM seeking one&#8212;a good, steady muzhik.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But I am NOT a good, steady muzhik.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Fie, fie!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What?&#34; he sniggers. &#34;A husband for you? The impudence of you! A&#10;&#39;husband&#39;! Go along!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Listen to me. I am tired of tramping.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Then go home.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;This time there ensues a long pause. Then the woman says very&#10;softly:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I have neither home nor kindred.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;A lie!&#34; ejaculates the young fellow.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No, by God it is not a lie! The Mother of God forget me if it&#10;is.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In these last words I can detect the note of tears. By this time&#10;the situation has become intolerable, for I am yearning to rise and&#10;kick the young fellow out of the hut, and then to have a long and&#10;earnest talk with his companion. &#34;Oh that I could take her to my&#10;arms,&#34; I reflect, &#34;and cherish her as I would a poor lost&#10;child!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;After a while the sounds of a new struggle between the pair are&#10;heard.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Don&#39;t put me off like that!&#34; growls the young fellow.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And don&#39;t you make any attempt upon me! I am not the sort of&#10;woman to be forced.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The next moment there arises a cry of pain and astonishment.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What was that for? What was that for?&#34; the woman wails.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With an answering exclamation I spring to my feet, for my&#10;feelings have become those of a wild beast.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At once everything grows quiet again, save that someone, crawls&#10;over the floor and, in leaving the hut, jars the latch of the&#10;crazy, single-hinged portal.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It was not my fault,&#34; grumbles the young fellow. &#34;It all came&#10;of that stinking woman offering herself to me. Besides, the place&#10;is full of bugs, and I cannot sleep.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Beast!&#34; pants someone in the vicinity.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Hold your tongue, bitch!&#34; is the fellow&#39;s retort.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;By now the rain has ceased, and such air as filters through the&#10;window seems increasedly stifling. Momentarily the hush grows&#10;deeper, until the breast feels filled with a sense of oppression,&#10;and the face and eyes as though they were glued over with a web.&#10;Even when I step into the yard I find the place to be like a cellar&#10;on a summer&#39;s day, when the very ice has melted in the dark&#10;retreat, and the latter&#39;s black cavity is charged with hot, viscous&#10;humidity.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Somewhere near me a woman is gulping out sobs. For a moment or&#10;two I listen; then I approach her, and come upon her seated in a&#10;corner with her head in her hands, and her body rocking to and fro&#10;as though she were doing me obeisance.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Yet I feel angry, somehow, and remain standing before her&#10;without speaking&#8212;until at length I ask:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Are you mad?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Go away,&#34; is, after a pause, her only reply.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I heard all that you said to that young fellow.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh, did you? Then what business is it of yours? Are you my&#10;brother?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Yet she speaks the words absent-mindedly rather than angrily.&#10;Around us the dim, blurred walls are peering in our direction with&#10;sightless eyes, while in the vicinity a bullock is drawing deep&#10;breaths.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I seat myself by her side.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Should you remain much longer in that position,&#34; I remark, &#34;you&#10;will have a headache.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There follows no reply.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Am I disturbing you?&#34; I continue.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh no; not at all.&#34; And, lowering her hands, she looks at me.&#10;&#34;Whence do you come?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;From Nizhni Novgorod.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh, from a long way off!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Do you care for that young fellow?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Not for a moment or two does she answer; and when she does so&#10;she answers as though the words have been rehearsed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Not particularly. It is that he is a strong young fellow who&#10;has lost his way, and is too much of a fool (as you too must have&#10;seen) to find it again. So I am very sorry for him. A good muzhik&#10;ought to be well placed.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;On the bell of the church there strikes the hour of two. Without&#10;interrupting herself, the woman crosses her breast at each&#10;stroke.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Always,&#34; she continues, &#34;I feel sorry when I see a fine young&#10;fellow going to the dogs. If I were able, I would take all such&#10;young men, and restore them to the right road.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Then you are not sorry FOR YOURSELF?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Not for myself? Oh yes, for myself as well.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Then why flaunt yourself before this booby, as you have been&#10;doing?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Because I might reform him. Do you not think so? Ah, you do not&#10;know me.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A sigh escapes her.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;He hit you, I think?&#34; I venture.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No, he did not. And in any case you are not to touch him.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yet you cried out?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Suddenly she leans towards me, and says:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, he did strike me&#8212;he struck me on the breast, and would&#10;have overpowered me had it not been that I cannot, I will not, do&#10;things heartlessly, like a cat. Oh, the brutes that men can&#10;be!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Here the conversation undergoes an interruption through the fact&#10;that someone has come out to the hut door, and is whistling softly,&#10;as for a dog.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;There he is!&#34; whispers the woman.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Then had I not best send him about his business?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No, no!&#34; she exclaims, catching at my knees. &#34;No need is there&#10;for that, no need is there for that!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then with a low moan she adds:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh Lord, how I pity our folk and their lives! Oh God our&#10;Father!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Her shoulders heave, and presently she bursts into tears, with a&#10;whisper, between the pitiful sobs, of:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;How, on such a night as this, one remembers all that one has&#10;ever seen, and the folk that ever one has known! And oh, how&#10;wearisome, wearisome it all is! And how I should like to cry&#10;throughout the world&#8212;But to cry what? I know not&#8212;I have no message&#10;to deliver.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;That feeling I can understand as well as she, for all too often&#10;has it seemed to crush my soul with voiceless longing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then, as I stroke her bowed head and quivering shoulder, I ask&#10;her who she is; and presently, on growing a little calmer, she&#10;tells me the history of her life.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She is, it appears, the daughter of a carpenter and bee-keeper.&#10;On her mother&#39;s death, this man married a young woman, and allowed&#10;her, as stepmother, to persuade him to place the narrator, Tatiana,&#10;in a convent, where she (Tatiana) lived from the age of nine till&#10;adolescence, and, meanwhile, was taught her letters, and also a&#10;certain amount of manual labour; until, later, her father married&#10;her off to a friend of his, a well-to-do ex-soldier, who was acting&#10;as forester on the convent&#39;s estate.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As the woman relates this, I feel vexed that I cannot see her&#10;face&#8212;only a dim, round blur amid which there looms what appears to&#10;be a pair of closed eyes. Also, so complete is the stillness, that&#10;she can narrate her story in a barely audible whisper; and I gain&#10;the impression that the pair of us are sitting plunged in a void of&#10;darkness where life does not exist, yet where we are destined to&#10;begin life.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;However, the man was a libertine and a drunkard, and many a&#10;riotous night did he spend with his cronies in the porter&#39;s lodge&#10;of the convent. Also, he tried to arouse a similar taste in myself;&#10;and though for a time I resisted the tendency, I at length, on his&#10;taking to beating me, yielded. Only for one man, however, had I&#10;really a liking; and with him it was, and not with my husband, that&#10;I first learnt the meaning of spousehood&#8230; . Unfortunately, my lover&#10;himself was married; and in time his wife came to hear of me, and&#10;procured my husband&#39;s dismissal. The chief reason was that the&#10;lady, a person of great wealth, was herself handsome, albeit stout,&#10;and did not care to see her place assumed by a nobody. Next, my&#10;husband died of drink; and as my father had long been dead, and I&#10;found myself alone, I went to see and consult my stepmother. All&#10;that she said, however, was: &#39;Why come to me? Go and think things&#10;out for yourself.&#39; And I too then reflected: &#39;Yes, why should I&#10;have gone to her?&#39; and repaired to the convent. Yet even there&#10;there seemed to be no place left for me, and eventually old Mother&#10;Taisia, who had once been my governess, said: &#39;Tatiana, do you&#10;return to the world, for there, and only there, will you have a&#10;chance of happiness. So to the world I returned&#8212;and still am&#10;roaming it.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Your quest of happiness is not following an easy road!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It is following the road that it best can.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;By now the darkness has ceased to keep spread over us, as it&#10;were, the stretched web of a heavy curtain, but has grown thinner&#10;and more transparent with the tension, save that, in places (for&#10;instance, in the window of the hut), it still lies in thick folds&#10;or clots as it peers at us with its sightless eyes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Over the hummock-like roofs of the huts rise the church&#39;s&#10;steeple and the poplar trees; while hither and thither on the wall&#10;of the hut, the cracks and holes in the crumbling plaster have&#10;caused the wall to resemble the map of an unknown country.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Glancing at the woman&#39;s dark eyes, I perceive them to be shining&#10;as pensively, innocently as the eyes of a young maiden.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You are indeed a curious woman!&#34; I remark.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Perhaps I am,&#34; she replies as she moistens her lips with a&#10;slender, almost feline tongue.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What are you really seeking?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I have considered the matter, and know, at last, my mind. It is&#10;this: I hope some day to fall in with a good muzhik with whom to go&#10;in search of land. Probably land of the kind, I mean, is to be&#10;found in the neighbourhood of New Athos, [A monastery in the&#10;Caucasus, built on the reputed site of a cave tenanted by Simeon&#10;the Canaanite] for I have been there already, and know of a likely&#10;spot for the purpose. And there we shall set our place in order,&#10;and lay out a garden and an orchard, and prepare as much plough&#10;land as we may need for our working.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Her words are now firmer, more assured.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And when we have put everything in order, other folk may join&#10;us; and then, as the oldest settlers in the place, we shall hold&#10;the position of honour. And thus things will continue until a new&#10;village, really a fine settlement, will have become formed&#8212;a&#10;settlement of which my husband will be selected the warden until&#10;such time as I shall have made of him a barin [Gentleman or squire]&#10;outright. Also, children may one day play in that garden, and a&#10;summer-house be built there. Ah, how delightful such a life&#10;appears!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In fact, she has planned out the future so thoroughly that&#10;already she can describe the new establishment in as much detail as&#10;though she has long been a resident in it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, I yearn indeed for a nice home!&#34; she continues. &#34;Oh that&#10;such a home could fall to my lot! But the first requisite, of&#10;course, is a muzhik.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Her gentle face and eyes peer into the waning night as though&#10;they aspire to caress everything upon which they may light.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And all the while I am feeling sorry for her&#8212;sorry almost to&#10;tears. To conceal the fact I murmur:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Should I myself suit you?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She gives a faint laugh.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why not?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Because the ideas in your mind are different from mine.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;How do you know what my ideas are?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She edges away from me a little, then says drily:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Because I can see them in your eyes. To be plain, I could never&#10;consent.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With a finger tapping upon the mouldy, gnarled old oaken stump&#10;on which we are sitting, she adds:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The Cossacks, for instance, live comfortably enough; yet I do&#10;not like them.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What in them is it that displeases you?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Somehow they repel me. True, much of everything is theirs; yet&#10;also they have ways which alienate me.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Unable any longer to conceal from her my pity, I say gently:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Never, I fear, will you discover what you are seeking.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She shakes her head protestingly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And never ought a woman to be discouraged,&#34; she retorts.&#10;&#34;Woman&#39;s proper round is to wish for a child, and to nurse it, and,&#10;when it has been weaned, to get herself ready to have another one.&#10;That is how woman should live. She should live as pass spring and&#10;summer, autumn and winter.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I find it a pleasure to watch the play of the woman&#39;s&#10;intellectual features; and though, also, I long to take her in my&#10;arms, I feel that my better plan will be to seek once more the&#10;quiet, empty steppe, and, bearing in me the recollection of this&#10;woman, to resume my lonely journey towards the region where the&#10;silver wall of the mountains merges with the sky, and the dark&#10;ravines gape at the steppe with their chilly jaws. At the moment,&#10;however, I cannot so do, for the Cossacks have temporarily deprived&#10;me of my passport.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What are you yourself seeking?&#34; she asks suddenly as again she&#10;edges towards me.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Simply nothing. My one desire is to observe how folk live.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And are you travelling alone?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I am.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Even as am I. Oh God, how many lonely people there are in the&#10;world!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;By this time the cattle are awakening from slumber, and, with&#10;their soft lowings, reminding one of a pipe which I used to hear&#10;played by a certain blind old man. Next, four times, with unsteady&#10;touch, the drowsy watchman strikes his gong&#8212;twice softly, once with&#10;a vigour that clangs the metal again, and a fourth time with a mere&#10;tap of the iron hammer against the copper plate.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What sort of lives do the majority of folk lead?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Sorry lives.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, that is what I too have found.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A pause follows. Then the woman says quietly:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;See, dawn is breaking, yet never this night have my eyes&#10;closed. Often I am like that; often I keep thinking and thinking&#10;until I seem to be the only human being in the world, and the only&#10;human being destined to re-order it.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Many folk live unworthy lives. They live them amid discord,&#10;abasement, and wrongs innumerable, wrongs born of want and&#10;stupidity.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And as the words leave my lips my mind loses itself in&#10;recollections of all the dark and harrowing and shameful scenes&#10;that I have beheld.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Listen,&#34; I say. &#34;You may approach a man with nothing but good&#10;in your heart, and be prepared to surrender both your freedom and&#10;your strength; yet still he may fail to understand you aright. And&#10;how shall he be blamed for this, seeing that never may he have been&#10;shown what is good?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She lays a hand upon my shoulder, and looks straight into my&#10;eyes as she parts her comely lips.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;True,&#34; she rejoins&#8212;&#34;But, dear friend, it is also true that&#10;goodness never bargains.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Together she and I seem to be drifting towards a vista which is&#10;coming to look, as it sloughs the shadow of night, ever clearer and&#10;clearer. It is a vista of white huts, silvery trees, a red church,&#10;and dew-bespangled earth. And as the sun rises he reveals to us&#10;clustered, transparent clouds which, like thousands of snow-white&#10;birds, go gliding over our heads.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes,&#34; she whispers again as gently she gives me a nudge. &#34;As&#10;one pursues one&#39;s lonely way one thinks and thinks&#8212;but of what?&#10;Dear friend, you have said that no one really cares what is the&#10;matter. Ah, HOW true that is!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Here she springs to her feet, and, pulling me up with her, glues&#10;herself to my breast with a vehemence which causes me momentarily&#10;to push her away. Upon this, bursting into tears, she tends towards&#10;me again, and kisses me with lips so dry as almost to cut me&#8212;she&#10;kisses me in a way which penetrates to my very soul.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You have been oh, so good!&#34; she whispers softly. As she speaks,&#10;the earth seems to be sinking under my feet.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then she tears herself away, glances around the courtyard, and&#10;darts to a corner where, under a fence, a clump of herbage is&#10;sprouting.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Go now,&#34; she adds in a whisper. &#34;Yes, go.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then, with a confused smile, as, crouching among the herbage as&#10;though it had been a small cave, she rearranges her hair, she&#10;adds:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It has befallen so. Ah, me! May God grant unto me His&#10;pardon!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Astonished, feeling that I must be dreaming, I gaze at her with&#10;gratitude, for I sense an extraordinary lightness to be present in&#10;my breast, a radiant void through which joyous, intangible words&#10;and thoughts keep flying as swallows wheel across the&#10;firmament.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Amid a great sorrow,&#34; she adds, &#34;even a small joy becomes a&#10;great felicity.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Yet as I glance at the woman&#39;s bosom, whereon moist beads are&#10;standing like dewdrops on the outer earth; as I glance at that&#10;bosom, whereon the sun&#39;s rays are finding a roseate reflection, as&#10;though the blood were oozing through the skin, my rapture dies&#10;away, and turns to sorrow, heartache, and tears. For in me there is&#10;a presentiment that before the living juice within that bosom shall&#10;have borne fruit, it will have become dried up.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Presently, in a tone almost of self-excuse, and one wherein the&#10;words sound a little sadly, she continues:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Times there are when something comes pouring into my soul which&#10;makes my breasts ache with the pain of it. What is there for me to&#10;do at such moments save reveal my thoughts to the moon, or, in the&#10;daytime, to a river? Oh God in Heaven! And afterwards I feel as&#10;ashamed of myself!&#8230; Do not look at me like that. Why stare at me&#10;with those eyes, eyes so like the eyes of a child?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;YOUR face, rather, is like a child&#39;s,&#34; I remark.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What? Is it so stupid?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Something like that.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As she fastens up her bodice she continues:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Soon the time will be five o&#39;clock, when the bell will ring for&#10;Mass. To Mass I must go today, for I have a prayer to offer to the&#10;Mother of God&#8230; Shall you be leaving here soon?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes&#8212;as soon, that is to say, as I have received back my&#10;passport.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And for what destination?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;For Alatyr. And you?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She straightens her attire, and rises. As she does so I perceive&#10;that her hips are narrower than her shoulders, and that throughout&#10;she is well-proportioned and symmetrical.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I? As yet I do not know. True, I had thought of proceeding to&#10;Naltchik, but now, perhaps, I shall not do so, for all my future is&#10;uncertain.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Upon that she extends to me a pair of strong, capable arms, and&#10;proposes with a blush:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Shall we kiss once more before we part?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She clasps me with the one arm, and with the other makes the&#10;sign of the cross, adding:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Good-bye, dear friend, and may Christ requite you for all your&#10;words, for all your sympathy!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Then shall we travel together?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At the words she frees herself, and says firmly, nay,&#10;sternly:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Not so. Never would I consent to such a plan. Of course, had&#10;you been a muzhik&#8212;but no. Even then what would have been the use of&#10;it, seeing that life is to be measured, not by a single hour, but&#10;by years?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And, quietly smiling me a farewell, she moves away towards the&#10;hut, whilst I, remaining seated, lose myself in thoughts of her.&#10;Will she ever overtake her quest in life? Shall I ever behold her&#10;again?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The bell for early Mass begins, though for some time past the&#10;hamlet has been astir, and humming in a sedate and non-festive&#10;fashion.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I enter the hut to fetch my wallet, and find the place empty.&#10;Evidently the whole party has left by the gap in the broken-down&#10;wall.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I repair, next, to the Ataman&#39;s office, where I receive back my&#10;passport before setting out to look for my companions in the&#10;square.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In similar fashion to yesterday those &#34;folk from Russia&#34; are&#10;lolling alongside the churchyard wall, and also have seated among&#10;them, leaning his back against a log, the fat-jowled youth from&#10;Penza, with his bruised face looking even larger and uglier than&#10;before, for the reason that his eyes are sunken amid purple&#10;protuberances.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Presently there arrives a newcomer in the shape of an old man&#10;with a grey head adorned with a faded velvet skull-cap, a pointed&#10;beard, a lean, withered frame, prominent cheekbones, a red,&#10;porous-looking, cunningly hooked nose, and the eyes of a thief.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Him a flaxen-haired youth from Orel joins with a similar youth&#10;in accosting.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why are YOU tramping?&#34; inquires the former.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And why are YOU?&#34; the old man retorts in nasal tones as,&#10;looking at no one, he proceeds to mend the handle of a battered&#10;metal teapot with a piece of wire.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;We are travelling in search of work, and therefore living as we&#10;have been commanded to live.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;By WHOM commanded?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;By God. Have you forgotten?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Carelessly, but succinctly, the old man retorts:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Take heed lest upon you, some day, God vomit all the dust and&#10;litter which you are raising by tramping His earth!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;How?&#34; cries one of the youths, a long-eared stripling.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Were not Christ and His Apostles also tramps?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, CHRIST,&#34; is the old man&#39;s meaning reply as he raises his&#10;sharp eyes to those of his opponent. &#34;But what are you talking of,&#10;you fools? With whom are you daring to compare yourselves? Take&#10;care lest I report you to the Cossacks!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I have listened to many such arguments, and always found them&#10;distasteful, even as I have done discussions regarding the soul.&#10;Hence I feel inclined to depart.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At this moment, however, Konev makes his appearance. His mien is&#10;dejected, and his body perspiring, while his eyes keep blinking&#10;rapidly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Has any one seen Tanka&#8212;that woman from Riazan?&#34; he inquires.&#10;&#34;No? Then the bitch must have bolted during the night. The fact is&#10;that, overnight, someone gave me a drop or two to drink, a mere&#10;dram, but enough to lay me as fast asleep as a bear in winter-time.&#10;And in the meantime, she must have run away with that Penza&#10;fellow.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No, HE is here,&#34; I remark.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh, he is, is he? Well, as what has the company registered&#10;itself? As a set of ikon-painters, I should think!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Again he begins to look anxiously about him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Where can she have got to?&#34; he queries.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;To Mass, maybe.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Of course! Well, I am greatly smitten with her. Yes, my word I&#10;am!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Nevertheless, when Mass comes to an end, and, to the sound of a&#10;merry peal of bells, the well-dressed local Cossacks file out of&#10;church, and distribute themselves in gaudy streams about the&#10;hamlet, no Tatiana makes her appearance.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Then she IS gone,&#34; says Konev ruefully. &#34;But I&#39;ll find her yet!&#10;I&#39;LL come up with her!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;That this will happen I do not feel confident. Nor do I desire&#10;that it should.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Five years later I am pacing the courtyard of the Metechski&#10;Prison in Tiflis, and, as I do so, trying to imagine for what&#10;particular offence I have been incarcerated in that place of&#10;confinement.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Picturesquely grim without, the institution is, inwardly,&#10;peopled with a set of cheerful, but clumsy, humourists. That is to&#10;say, it would seem as though, &#34;by order of the authorities,&#34; the&#10;inmates are presenting a stage spectacle in which they are playing,&#10;willingly and zealously, but with a complete lack of experience,&#10;imperfectly comprehended roles as prisoners, warders, and&#10;gendarmes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For instance, today, when a warder and a gendarme came to my&#10;cell to escort me to exercise, and I said to them, &#34;May I be&#10;excused exercise today? I am not very well, and do not feel like,&#10;etcetera, etcetera,&#34; the gendarme, a tall, handsome man with a red&#10;beard, held up to me a warning finger.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;NO ONE,&#34; he said, &#34;has given you permission to feel, or not to&#10;feel, like doing things.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;To which the warder, a man as dark as a chimney-sweep, with&#10;large blue &#34;whites&#34; to his eyes, added stutteringly:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;To no one here has permission been given to feel, or not to&#10;feel, like doing things. You hear that?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So to exercise I went.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In this stone-paved yard the air is as hot as in an oven, for&#10;overhead there lours only a small, flat patch of dull, drab-tinted&#10;sky, and on three sides of the yard rise high grey walls, with, on&#10;the fourth, the entrance-gates, topped by a sort of look-out&#10;post.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Over the roof of the building there comes floating the dull roar&#10;of the turbulent river Kura, mingled with shouts from the hucksters&#10;of the Avlabar Bazaar (the town&#39;s Asiatic quarter) and as a cross&#10;motif thrown into these sounds, the sighing of the wind and the&#10;cooing of doves. In fact, to be here is like being in a drum which&#10;a myriad drumsticks are beating.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Through the bars of the double line of windows on the second and&#10;the third stories peer the murky faces and towsled heads of some of&#10;the inmates. One of the latter spits his furthest into the&#10;yard&#8212;evidently with the intention of hitting myself: but all his&#10;efforts prove vain. Another one shouts with a mordant&#10;expletive:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Hi, you! Why do you keep tramping up and down like an old hen?&#10;Hold up your head!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Meanwhile the inmates continue to intone in concert a strange&#10;chant which is as tangled as a skein of wool after serving as a&#10;plaything for a kitten&#39;s prolonged game of sport. Sadly the chant&#10;meanders, wavers, to a high, wailing note. Then, as it were, it&#10;soars yet higher towards the dull, murky sky, breaks suddenly into&#10;a snarl, and, growling like a wild beast in terror, dies away to&#10;give place to a refrain which coils, trickles forth from between&#10;the bars of the windows until it has permeated the free, torrid&#10;air.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As I listen to that refrain, long familiar to me, it seems to&#10;voice something intelligible, and agitates my soul almost to a&#10;sense of agony&#8230; .&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Presently, while pacing up and down in the shadow of the&#10;building, I happen to glance towards the line of windows. Glued to&#10;the framework of one of the iron window-squares, I can discern a&#10;blue-eyed face. Overgrown with an untidy sable beard it is, as well&#10;as stamped with a look of perpetually grieved surprise.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That must be Konev,&#34; I say to myself aloud.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Konev it is&#8212;Konev of the well-remembered eyes. Even at this&#10;moment they are regarding me with puckered attention.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I throw around me a hasty glance. My own warder is dozing on a&#10;shady bench near the entrance. Two more warders are engaged in&#10;throwing dice. A fourth is superintending the pumping of water by&#10;two convicts, and superciliously marking time for their lever with&#10;the formula, &#34;Mashkam, dashkam! Dashkam, mashkam!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I move towards the wall.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Is that you, Konev?&#34; is my inquiry.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It is,&#34; he mutters as he thrusts his head a little further&#10;through the grating. &#34;Yes, Konev I am, but who you are I have not a&#10;notion.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What are you here for?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;For a matter of base coin, though, to be truthful, I am here&#10;accidentally, without genuine cause.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The warder rouses himself, and, with his keys jingling like a&#10;set of fetters, utters drowsily the command:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Do not stand still. Also, move further from the wall. To&#10;approach it is forbidden.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But it is so hot in the middle of the yard, sir!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Everywhere it is hot,&#34; retorts the man reprovingly, and his&#10;head subsides again. From above comes the whispered query:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Who ARE you?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well, do you remember Tatiana, the woman from Riazan?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;DO I remember her?&#34; Konev&#39;s voice has in it a touch of subdued&#10;resentment. &#34;DO I remember her? Why, I was tried in court together&#10;with her!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Together with HER? Was she too sentenced for the passing of&#10;base coin?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes. Why should she not have been? She was merely the victim of&#10;an accident, even as I was.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As I resume my walk in the stifling shade I detect that, from&#10;the windows of the basement there is issuing a smell of, in equal&#10;parts, rotten leather, mouldy grain, and dampness. To my mind there&#10;recur Tatiana&#39;s words: &#34;Amid a great sorrow even a small joy&#10;becomes a great felicity,&#34; and, &#34;I should like to build a village&#10;on some land of my own, and create for myself a new and better&#10;life.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And to my recollection there recur also Tatiana&#39;s face and&#10;yearning, hungry breast. As I stand thinking of these things, there&#10;come dropping on to my head from above the low-spoken, ashen-grey&#10;words:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The chief conspirator in the matter was her lover, the son of a&#10;priest. He it was who engineered the plot. He has been sentenced to&#10;ten years penal servitude.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And she?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Tatiana Vasilievna? To the same, and I also. I leave for&#10;Siberia the day after tomorrow. The trial was held at Kutair. In&#10;Russia I should have got off with a lighter sentence than here, for&#10;the folk in these parts are, one and all, evil, barbaric&#10;scoundrels.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And Tatiana, has she any children?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;How could she have while living such a rough life as this? Of&#10;course not! Besides, the priest&#39;s son is a consumptive.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Indeed sorry for her am I!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;So I expect.&#34; And in Konev&#39;s tone there would seem to be a&#10;touch of meaning. &#34;The woman was a fool&#8212;of that there can be no&#10;doubt; but also she was comely, as well as a person out of the&#10;common in her pity for folk.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Was it then that you found her again?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;When?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;On that Feast of the Assumption?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh no. It was only during the following winter that I came up&#10;with her. At the time she was serving as governess to the children&#10;of an old officer in Batum whose wife had left him.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Something snaps behind me&#8212;something sounding like the hammer of&#10;a revolver. However, it is only the warder closing the lid of his&#10;huge watch before restoring the watch to his pocket, giving himself&#10;a stretch, and yawning to the utmost extent of his jaws.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You see, she had money, and, but for her restlessness, might&#10;have lived a comfortable life enough. As it was, her&#10;restlessness&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Time for exercise is up!&#34; shouts the warder.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Who are you?&#34; adds Konev hastily. &#34;Somehow I seem to remember&#10;your face; but I cannot place it.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Yet so stung am I with what I have heard that I move away in&#10;silence: save that just as I reach the top of the steps I turn to&#10;cry:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Goodbye, mate, and give her my greeting.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What are you bawling for?&#34; blusters the warder&#8230; .&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The corridor is dim, and filled with an oppressive odour. The&#10;warder swings his keys with a dry, thin clash, and I, to dull the&#10;pain in my heart, strive to imitate him. But the attempt proves&#10;futile; and as the warder opens the door of my cell he says&#10;severely:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;In with you, ten-years man!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Entering, I move towards the window. Between some grey spikes on&#10;a wall I can just discern the boisterous current of the Kura, with&#10;sakli [warehouses] and houses glued to the opposite bank, and the&#10;figures of some workmen on the roof of a tanning shed. Below, with&#10;his cap pushed to the back of his head, a sentry is pacing&#10;backwards and forwards.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Wearily my mind recalls the many scores of Russian folk whom it&#10;has seen perish to no purpose. And as it does so it feels crushed,&#10;as in a vice, beneath the burden of great and inexorable sorrow&#10;with which all life is dowered.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 19, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/3920')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('In a Mountain Defile'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;In a mountain defile near a little tributary of the Sunzha,&#10;there was being built a workman&#39;s barraque&#8212;a low, long edifice&#10;which reminded one of a large coffin lid.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The building was approaching completion, and, meanwhile, a score&#10;of carpenters were employed in fashioning thin planks into doors of&#10;equal thinness, knocking together benches and tables, and fitting&#10;window-frames into the small window-squares.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Also, to assist these carpenters in the task of protecting the&#10;barraque from tribesmen&#39;s nocturnal raids, the shrill-voiced young&#10;student of civil engineering who had been set in charge of the work&#10;had sent to the place, as watchman, an ex-soldier named Paul&#10;Ivanovitch, a man of the Cossack type, and myself.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Yet whereas we were out-at-elbows, the carpenters were sleek,&#10;respectable, monied, well-clad fellows. Also, there was something&#10;dour and irritating about them, since, for one thing, they had&#10;failed to respond to our greeting on our first appearance, and eyed&#10;us with nothing but dislike and suspicion. Hence, hurt by their&#10;chilly attitude, we had withdrawn from their immediate&#10;neighbourhood, constructed a causeway of stepping stones to the&#10;eastern bank of the rivulet, and taken up our abode beneath the&#10;chaotic grey mists which enveloped the mountain side in that&#10;direction.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Also, over the carpenters there was a foreman&#8212;a man whose bony&#10;frame, clad in a white shirt and a pair of white trousers, looked&#10;always as though it were ready-attired for death. Moreover, he wore&#10;no cap to conceal the yellow patch of baldness which covered most&#10;of his head, and, in addition, his nose was squat and grey, his&#10;neck and face had over them skin of a porous, pumice-like&#10;consistency, his eyes were green and dim, and upon his features&#10;there was stamped a dead and disagreeable expression. To be candid,&#10;however, behind the dark lips lay a set of fine, close teeth, while&#10;the hairs of the grey beard (a beard trimmed after the Tartar&#10;fashion) were thick and, seemingly, soft.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Never did this man put a hand actually to the work; always he&#10;kept roaming about with the large, rigid-looking fingers of his&#10;hands tucked into his belt, and his fixed and expressionless eyes&#10;scanning the barraque, the men, and the work as his lips vented&#10;some such lines as:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p class=&#34;poem&#34;&#62;Oh God our Father, bound hast Thou&#60;br /&#62;&#10;A crown of thorns upon my brow!&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Listen to my humble prayer!&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Lighten the burden which I bear!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What on earth can be in the man&#39;s mind?&#34; once remarked the&#10;ex-soldier, with a frowning glance at the singer.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As for our duties, my mates and I had nothing to do, and soon&#10;began to find the time tedious. For his part, the man with the&#10;Cossack physiognomy scaled the mountain side; whence he could be&#10;heard whistling and snapping twigs with his heavy feet, while the&#10;ex-soldier selected a space between two rocks for a shelter of&#10;ace-rose boughs, and, stretching himself on his stomach, fell to&#10;smoking strong mountain tobacco in his large meerschaum pipe as&#10;dimly, dreamily he contemplated the play of the mountain torrent.&#10;Lastly, I myself selected a seat on a rock which overhung the&#10;brook, dipped my feet in the coolness of the water, and proceeded&#10;to mend my shirt.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At intervals, the defile would convey to our ears a dull echo of&#10;sounds so wholly at variance with the locality as muffled&#10;hammer-blows, a screeching of saws, a rasping of planes, and a&#10;confused murmur of human voices.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Also, a moist breeze blew constantly from the dark-blue depths&#10;of the defile, and caused the stiff, upright larches on the knoll&#10;behind the barraque to rustle their boughs, and distilled from the&#10;rank soil the voluptuous scents of ace-rose and pitch-pine, and&#10;evoked in the trees&#39; quiet gloom a soft, crooning, somnolent&#10;lullaby.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;About a sazhen [Fathom] below the level of the barraque there&#10;coursed noisily over its bed of stones a rivulet white with foam.&#10;Yet though of other sounds in the vicinity there were but few, the&#10;general effect was to suggest that everything in the neighbourhood&#10;was speaking or singing a tale of such sort as to shame the human&#10;species into silence.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;On our own side of the valley the ground lay bathed in&#10;sunshine&#8212;lay scorched to the point of seeming to have spread over&#10;it a tissue-cloth. Old gold in colour, while from every side arose&#10;the sweet perfume of dried grasses, and in dark clefts there could&#10;be seen sprouting the long, straight spears and fiery, reddish,&#10;cone-shaped blossoms of that bold, hardy plant which is known to us&#10;as saxifrage&#8212;the plant of which the contemplation makes one long to&#10;burst into music, and fills one&#39;s whole body with sensuous&#10;languor.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Laced with palpitating, snow-white foam, the beautiful rivulet&#10;pursued its sportive way over tessellated stones which flashed&#10;through the eddies of the glassy, sunlit, amber-coloured water with&#10;the silken sheen of a patchwork carpet or costly shawl of&#10;Cashmir.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Through the mouth of the defile one could reach the valley of&#10;the Sunzha, whence, since men were ther, building a railway to&#10;Petrovsk on the Caspian Sea, there kept issuing and breaking&#10;against the crags a dull rumble of explosions, of iron rasped&#10;against stone, of whistles of works locomotives, and of animated&#10;human voices.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;From the barraque the distance to the point where the defile&#10;debouched upon the valley was about a hundred paces, and as one&#10;issued thence one could see, away to the left, the level steppes of&#10;the Cis-Caucasus, with a boundary wall of blue hills, topped by the&#10;silver-hewn saddle of Mount Elburz behind it. True, for the most&#10;part the steppes had a dry, yellow, sandy look, with merely here&#10;and there dark patches of gardens or black poplar clumps which&#10;rendered the golden glare more glaring still; yet also there could&#10;be discerned on the expanse farm buildings shaped like lumps of&#10;sugar or butter, with, in their vicinity, toylike human beings and&#10;diminutive cattle&#8212;the whole shimmering and melting in a mirage born&#10;of the heat. And at the mere sight of those steppes, with their&#10;embroidery of silk under the blue of the zenith, one&#39;s muscles&#10;tightened, and one felt inspired with a longing to spring to one&#39;s&#10;feet, close one&#39;s eyes, and walk for ever with the soft, mournful&#10;song of the waste crooning in one&#39;s ears.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;To the right also of the defile lay the winding valley of the&#10;Sunzha, with more hills; and above those hills hung the blue sky,&#10;and in their flanks were clefts which, full of grey mist, kept&#10;emitting a ceaseless din of labour, a sound of dull explosions, as&#10;a great puissant force attained release.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Yet almost at the same moment would that hurly-burly so merge&#10;with the echo of our defile, so become buried in the defile&#39;s&#10;verdure and rock crevices, that once more the place would seem to&#10;be singing only its own gentle, gracious song.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And, should one turn to glance up the defile, it could be seen&#10;to grow narrower and narrower as it ascended towards the mists, and&#10;the latter to grow thicker and thicker until the whole defile was&#10;swathed in a dark blue pall. Higher yet there could be discerned&#10;the brilliant gleam of blue sky. Higher yet one could distinguish&#10;the ice-capped peak of Kara Dagh, floating and dissolving amid the&#10;( from here) invisible sunlight. Highest of all again brooded the&#10;serene, steadfast peace of heaven.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Also, everything was bathed in a strange tint of bluish grey: to&#10;which circumstance must have been due the fact that always one&#39;s&#10;soul felt filled with restlessness, one&#39;s heart stirred to&#10;disquietude, and fired as with intoxication, charged with&#10;incomprehensible thoughts, and conscious as of a summons to set&#10;forth for some unknown destination.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The foreman of the carpenters shaded his eyes to gaze in our&#10;direction; and as he did so, he drawled and rasped out in tedious&#10;fashion:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p class=&#34;poem&#34;&#62;&#34;Some shall to the left be sent,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;And in the pit of Hell lie pent.&#60;br /&#62;&#10;While others, holding palm in hand,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Shall on God&#39;s right take up their stand.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;DID you hear that?&#34; the ex-soldier growled through clenched&#10;teeth. &#34;&#39;Palm in hand&#39; indeed! Why, the fellow must be a Mennonite&#10;or a Molokan, though the two, really, are one, and absolutely&#10;indistinguishable, as well as equally foolish. Yes, &#39;palm in hand&#39;&#10;indeed!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Similarly could I understand the ex-soldier&#39;s indignation, for,&#10;like him, I felt that such dreary, monotonous singing was&#10;altogether out of place in a spot where everything could troll a&#10;song so delightful as to lead one to wish to hear nothing more, to&#10;hear only the whispering of the forest and the babbling of the&#10;stream. And especially out of place did the terms &#34;palm&#34; and&#10;&#34;Mennonite&#34; appear.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Yet I had no great love for the ex-soldier. Somehow he jarred&#10;upon me. Middle-aged, squat, square, and bleached with the sun, he&#10;had faded eyes, flattened-out features, and an expression of&#10;restless moroseness. Never could I make out what he really wanted,&#10;what he was really seeking. For instance, once, after reviewing the&#10;Caucasus from Khassav-Urt to Novorossisk, and from Batum to&#10;Derbent, and, during the review, crossing the mountain range by&#10;three different routes at least, he remarked with a disparaging&#10;smile:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I suppose the Lord God made the country.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You do not like it, then? How should I? Good for nothing is&#10;what I call it.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then, with a further glance at me, and a twist of his sinewy&#10;neck, he added:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;However, not bad altogether are its forests.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A native of Kaluga, he had served in Tashkend, and, in fighting&#10;with the Chechintzes of that region, had been wounded in the head&#10;with a stone. Yet as he told me the story of this incident, he&#10;smiled shamefacedly, and, throughout, kept his glassy eyes fixed&#10;upon the ground.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Though I am ashamed to confess it,&#34; he said, &#34;once a woman&#10;chipped a piece out of me. You see, the women of that region are&#10;shrieking devils&#8212;there is no other word for it; and when we&#10;captured a village called Akhal-Tiapa a number of them had to be&#10;cut up, so that they lay about in heaps, and their blood made&#10;walking slippery. Just as our company of the reserve entered the&#10;street, something caught me on the head. Afterwards, I learnt that&#10;a woman on a roof had thrown a stone, and, like the rest, had had&#10;to be put out of the way.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Here, knitting his brows, the ex-soldier went on in more serious&#10;vein:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yet all that folk used to say about those women, about their&#10;having beards to shave, turned out to be so much gossip, as I&#10;ascertained for myself. I did so by lifting the woman&#39;s skirt on&#10;the point of my bayonet, when I perceived that, though she was&#10;lean, and smelt like a goat, she was quite as regular as, as&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Things must have been indeed terrible on that expedition!&#34; I&#10;interposed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I do not know for certain, since, though men who took an actual&#10;part in the expedition&#39;s engagements have said that they were so&#10;(the Chechintze is a vicious brute, and never gives in), I myself&#10;know but little of the affair, since I spent my whole time in the&#10;reserve, and never once did my company advance to the assault. No,&#10;it merely lay about on the sand, and fired at long range. In fact,&#10;nothing but sand was to be seen thereabouts; nor did we ever&#10;succeed in finding out what the fighting was for. True, if a piece&#10;of country be good, it is in our interest to take it; but in the&#10;present case the country was poor and bare, with never a river in&#10;sight, and a climate so hot that all one thought of was one&#39;s&#10;mortal need of a drink. In fact, some of our fellows died of thirst&#10;outright. Moreover, in those parts there grows a sort of millet&#10;called dzhugar&#8212;millet which not only has a horrible taste, but&#10;proves absolutely delusive, since the more one eats of it, the less&#10;one feels filled.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As the ex-soldier told me the tale colourlessly and reluctantly,&#10;with frequent pauses between the sentences (as though either he&#10;found it difficult to recall the experience or he were thinking of&#10;something else), he never once looked me straight in the face, but&#10;kept his eyes shamefacedly fixed upon the ground.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Unwieldily and unhealthily stout, he always conveyed to me the&#10;impression of being charged with a vague discontent, a sort of&#10;captious inertia.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Absolutely unfit for settlement is this country&#34; he continued&#10;as he glanced around him. &#34;It is fit only to do nothing in. For&#10;that matter, one doesn&#39;t WANT to do anything in it, save to live&#10;with one&#39;s eyes bulging like a drunkard&#39;s&#8212;for the climate is too&#10;hot, and the place smells like a chemist&#39;s shop or a hospital.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Nevertheless, for the past eight years had he been roaming this&#10;&#34;too hot&#34; country, as though fascinated!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why not return to Riazan?&#34; I suggested.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Nothing would there be there for me to do,&#34; he replied through&#10;his teeth, and with an odd division of his words.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;My first encounter with him had been at the railway station at&#10;Armavir, where, purple in the face with excitement, he had been&#10;stamping like a horse, and, with distended eyes, hissing, or,&#10;rather, snarling, at a couple of Greeks:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I&#39;ll tear the flesh from your bones!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Meanwhile the two lean, withered, ragged, identically similar&#10;denizens of Hellas had been baring their sharp white teeth at&#10;intervals, and saying apologetically:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What has angered you, sir?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Finally, regardless of the Greeks&#39; words, the ex-soldier had&#10;beat his breast like a drum, and shouted in accents of increased&#10;venom:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Now, where are you living? In Russia, do you say? Then who is&#10;supporting you there? Aha-a-a! Russia, it is said, is a good&#10;foster-mother. I expect you say the same.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And, lastly, he had approached a fat, grey-headed, bemedalled&#10;gendarme, and complained to him:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Everyone curses us born Russians, yet everyone comes to live&#10;with us&#8212;Greeks, Germans, Songs, and the lot. And while they get&#10;their livelihood here, and cat and drink their fill, they continue&#10;to curse us. A scandal, is it not?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The third member of our party was a man of about thirty who wore&#10;a Cossack cap over his left ear, and had a Cossack forelock,&#10;rounded features, a large nose, a dark moustache, and a retrousse&#10;lip. When the volatile young engineering student first brought him&#10;to us and said, &#34;Here is another man for you,&#34; the newcomer glanced&#10;at me through the lashes of his elusive eyes&#8212;then plunged his hands&#10;into the pockets of his Turkish overalls. Just as we were&#10;departing, however, he withdrew one hand from the left trouser&#10;pocket, passed it slowly over the dark bristles of his unshaven&#10;chin, and asked in musical tones:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Do you come from Russia?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Whence else, I should like to know?&#34; snapped the ex-soldier&#10;gruffly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Upon this the newcomer twisted his right-hand moustache then&#10;replaced his hand in his pocket. Broad-shouldered, sturdy, and&#10;well-built throughout, he walked with the stride of a man who is&#10;accustomed to cover long distances. Yet with him he had brought&#10;neither wallet nor gripsack, and somehow his supercilious,&#10;retrousse upper lip and thickly fringed eyes irritated me, and&#10;inclined me to be suspicious of, and even actively to dislike, the&#10;man.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Suddenly, while we were proceeding along the causeway by the&#10;side of the rivulet, he turned to us, and said, as he nodded&#10;towards the sportively coursing water:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Look at the matchmaker!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The ex-soldier hoisted his bleached eyebrows, and gazed around&#10;him for a moment in bewilderment. Then he whispered:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The fool!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But, for my own part, I considered that what the man had said&#10;was apposite; that the rugged, boisterous little river did indeed&#10;resemble some fussy, light-hearted old lady who loved to arrange&#10;affaires du coeur both for her own private amusement and for the&#10;purpose of enabling other folk to realise the joys of affection&#10;amid which she was living, and of which she would never grow weary,&#10;and to which she desired to introduce the rest of the world as&#10;speedily as possible.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Similarly, when we arrived at the barraque this man with the&#10;Cossack face glanced at the rivulet, and then at the mountains and&#10;the sky, and, finally, appraised the scene in one pregnant,&#10;comprehensive exclamation of &#34;Slavno!&#34; [How splendid!]&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The ex-soldier, who was engaged in ridding himself of his&#10;knapsack, straightened himself, and asked with his arms set&#10;akimbo:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;WHAT is it that is so splendid?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For a moment or two the newcomer merely eyed the squat figure of&#10;his questioner&#8212;a figure upon which hung drab shreds as lichen hangs&#10;upon a stone. Then he said with a smile:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Cannot you see for yourself? Take that mountain there, and that&#10;cleft in the mountain&#8212;are they not good to look at?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And as he moved away, the ex-soldier gaped after him with a&#10;repeated whisper of:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The fool!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;To which presently he added in a louder, as well as a&#10;mysterious, tone:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I have heard that occasionally they send fever patients hither&#10;for their health.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The same evening saw two sturdy women arrive with supper for the&#10;carpenters; whereupon the clatter of labour ceased, and therefore&#10;the rustling of the forest and the murmuring of the rivulet became&#10;the more distinct.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Next, deliberately, and with many coughs, the ex-soldier set to&#10;work to collect some twigs and chips for the purpose of lighting a&#10;fire. After which, having arranged a kettle over the flames, he&#10;said to me suggestively:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You too should collect some firewood, for in these parts the&#10;nights are dark and chilly.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I set forth in search of chips among the stones which lay around&#10;the barraque, and, in so doing, stumbled across the newcomer, who&#10;was lying with his body resting on an elbow, and his head on his&#10;hand, as he conned a manuscript spread out before him. As he raised&#10;his eyes to gaze vaguely, inquiringly into my face, I saw that one&#10;of his eyes was larger than the other.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Evidently he divined that he interested me, for he smiled. Yet&#10;so taken aback by this was I, that I passed on my way without&#10;speaking.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Meanwhile the carpenters, disposed in two circles around the&#10;barraque (a circle to each woman), partook of a silent supper.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Deeper and deeper grew the shadow of night over the defile.&#10;Warmer and warmer, denser and denser, grew the air, until the&#10;twilight caused the slopes of the mountains to soften in outline,&#10;and the rocks to seem to swell and merge with the bluish-blackness&#10;which overhung the bed of the defile, and the superimposed heights&#10;to form a single apparent whole, and the scene in general to&#10;resolve itself into, become united into, one compact bulk.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Quietly then did tints hitherto red extinguish their tremulous&#10;glow&#8212;softly there flared up, dusted purple in the sunset&#39;s sheen,&#10;the peak of Kara Dagh. Vice versa, the foam of the rivulet now&#10;blushed to red, and, seemingly, assuaged its vehemence&#8212;flowed with&#10;a deeper, a more pensive, note; while similarly the forest hushed&#10;its voice, and appeared to stoop towards the water while emitting&#10;ever more powerful, intoxicating odours to mingle with the&#10;resinous, cloyingly sweet perfume of our wood fire.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The ex-soldier squatted down before the little blaze, and&#10;rearranged some fuel under the kettle.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Where is the other man?&#34; said he. &#34;Go and fetch him.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I departed for the purpose, and, on my way, heard one of the&#10;carpenters in the neighbourhood of the barraque say in a thick,&#10;unctuous, sing-song voice.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;A great work is it indeed!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Whereafter I heard the two women fall to drawling in low, hungry&#10;accents:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p class=&#34;poem&#34;&#62;&#34;With the flesh I&#39;ll conquer pain;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;The spirit shall my lust restrain;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;All-supreme the soul shall reign;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;And carnal vices lure in vain.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;True, the women pronounced their words distinctly enough; yet&#10;always they prolonged the final &#34;u&#34; sound of the stanza&#39;s first and&#10;third lines until, as the melody floated away into the darkness,&#10;and, as it were, sank to earth, it came to resemble the long-drawn&#10;howl of a wolf.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In answer to my invitation to come to supper, the newcomer&#10;sprang to his feet, folded up his manuscript, stuffed it into one&#10;of the pockets of his ragged coat, and said with a smile:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I had just been going to resort to the carpenters, for they&#10;would have given us some bread, I suppose? Long is it since I&#10;tasted anything.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The same words he repeated on our approaching the ex-soldier;&#10;much as though he took a pleasure in their phraseology.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You suppose that they would have given us bread?&#34; echoed the&#10;ex-soldier as he unfastened his wallet. &#34;Not they! No love is lost&#10;between them and ourselves.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Whom do you mean by &#39;ourselves&#39;?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Us here&#8212;you and myself&#8212;all Russian folk who may happen to be in&#10;these parts. From the way in which those fellows keep singing about&#10;palms, I should judge them to be sectarians of the sort called&#10;Mennonites.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Or Molokans, rather?&#34; the other man suggested as he seated&#10;himself in front of the fire.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, or Molokans. Molokans or Mennonites&#8212;they&#39;re all one. It is&#10;a German faith and though such fellows love a Teuton, they do not&#10;exactly welcome US.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Upon this the man with the Cossack forelock took a slice of&#10;bread which the ex-soldier cut from a loaf, with an onion and a&#10;pinch of salt. Then, as he regarded us with a pair of good-humoured&#10;eyes, he said, balancing his food on the palms of his hands:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;There is a spot on the Sunzha, near here, where those fellows&#10;have a colony of their own. Yes, I myself have visited it. True,&#10;those fellows are hard enough, but at the same time to speak&#10;plainly, NO ONE in these parts has any regard for us since only too&#10;many of the sort of Russian folk who come here in search of work&#10;are not overly-desirable.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Where do you yourself come from?&#34; The ex-soldier&#39;s tone was&#10;severe.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;From Kursk, we might say.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;From Russia, then?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, I suppose so. But I have no great opinion even of&#10;myself.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The ex-soldier glanced distrustfully at the newcomer. Then he&#10;remarked:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What you say is cant, sheer Jesuitism. It is fellows like&#10;THOSE, rather, that ought to have a poor opinion of&#10;themselves.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;To this the other made no reply&#8212;merely he put a piece of bread&#10;into his mouth. For a moment or two the ex-soldier eyed him&#10;frowningly. Then he continued:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You seem to me to be a native of the Don country?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, I have lived on the Don as well.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And also served in the army?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No. I was an only son.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Of a miestchanin?&#34; [A member of the small commercial&#10;class.]&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No, of a merchant.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And your name&#8212;?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Is Vasili.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The last reply came only after a pause, and reluctantly;&#10;wherefore, perceiving that the Kurskan had no particular desire to&#10;discuss his own affairs, the ex-soldier said no more on the&#10;subject, but lifted the kettle from the fire.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Molokans also had kindled a blaze behind the corner of the&#10;barraque, and now its glow was licking the yellow boards of the&#10;structure until they seemed almost to be liquescent, to be about to&#10;dissolve and flow over the ground in a golden stream.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Presently, as their fervour increased, the carpenters, invisible&#10;amid the obscurity, fell to singing hymns&#8212;the basses intoning&#10;monotonously, &#34;Sing, thou Holy Angel!&#34; and voices of higher pitch&#10;responding, coldly and formally.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p class=&#34;poem&#34;&#62;&#34;Sing ye!&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Sing glory unto Christ, thou Angel of Holiness!&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Sing ye!&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Our singing will we add unto Thine,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Thou Angel of Holiness!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And though the chorus failed altogether to dull the splashing of&#10;the rivulet and the babbling of the by-cut over a bed of stones, it&#10;seemed out of place in this particular spot; it aroused resentment&#10;against men who could not think of a lay more atune with the&#10;particular living, breathing objects around us.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Gradually darkness enveloped the defile until only over the&#10;mouth of the pass, over the spot where, gleaming a brilliant blue,&#10;the rivulet escaped into a cleft that was overhung with a mist of a&#10;deeper shade, was there not yet suspended the curtain of the&#10;Southern night.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Presently, the gloom caused one of the rocks in our vicinity to&#10;assume the guise of a monk who, kneeling in prayer, had his head&#10;adorned with a pointed skull-cap, and his face buried in his hands.&#10;Similarly, the stems of the trees stirred in the firelight until&#10;they developed the semblance of a file of friars entering, for&#10;early Mass, the porch of their chapel-of-ease.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;To my mind there then recurred a certain occasion when, on just&#10;such a dark and sultry night as this, I had been seated&#10;tale-telling under the boundary-wall of a row of monastic cells in&#10;the Don country. Suddenly I had heard a window above my head open,&#10;and someone exclaim in a kindly, youthful voice:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The Mother of God be blessed for all this goodly world of&#10;ours!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And though the window had closed again before I had had time to&#10;discern the speaker, I had known that there was resident in the&#10;monastery a friar who had large eyes, and a limp, and just such a&#10;face as had Vasili here; wherefore, in all probability it had been&#10;he who had breathed the benediction upon mankind at large, for the&#10;reason that moments there are when all humanity seems to be one&#39;s&#10;own body, and in oneself there seems to beat the heart of all&#10;humanity&#8230; .&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Vasili consumed his food deliberately as, breaking off morsels&#10;from his slice, and neatly parting his moustache, he placed the&#10;morsels in his mouth with a curious stirring of two globules which&#10;underlay the skin near the ears.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The ex-soldier, however, merely nibbled at his food&#8212;he ate but&#10;little, and that lazily. Then he extracted a pipe from his breast&#10;pocket, filled it with tobacco, lit it with a faggot taken from the&#10;fire, and said as he set himself to listen to the singing of the&#10;Molokans:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;They are filled full, and have started bleating. Always folk&#10;like them seek to be on the right side of the Almighty.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Does that hurt you in any way?&#34; Vasili asked with a smile.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No, but I do not respect them&#8212;they are less saints than&#10;humbugs, than prevaricators whose first word is God, and second&#10;word rouble.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;How do you know that?&#34; cried Vasili amusedly. &#34;And even if&#10;their first word IS God, and their second word rouble, we had best&#10;not be too hard upon them, since if they chose to be hard upon US,&#10;where should WE be? Yes, we have only to open our mouths to speak a&#10;word or two for ourselves, and we should find every fist at our&#10;teeth.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Quite so,&#34; the ex-soldier agreed as, taking up a square of&#10;scantling, he examined it attentively.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Whom DO you respect?&#34; Vasili continued after a pause.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I respect,&#34; the ex-soldier said with some emphasis, &#34;only the&#10;Russian people, the true Russian people, the folk who labour on&#10;land whereon labour is hard. Yet who are the folk whom you find&#10;HERE? In this part of the world the business of living is an easy&#10;one. Much of every sort of natural produce is to be had, and the&#10;soil is generous and light&#8212;you need but to scratch it for it to&#10;bear, and for yourself to reap. Yes, it is indulgent to a fault.&#10;Rather, it is like a maiden. Do but touch her, and a child will&#10;arrive.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Agreed,&#34; was Vasili&#39;s remark as he drank tea from a tin mug.&#10;&#34;Yet to this very part of the world is it that I should like to&#10;transport every soul in Russia.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And why?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Because here they could earn a living.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Then is not that possible in Russia?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well, why are you yourself here?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Because I am a man lacking ties.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And why are you lacking ties?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Because it has been so ordered&#8212;it is, so to speak, my lot.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Then had you not better consider WHY it is your lot?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The ex-soldier took his pipe from his mouth, let fall the hand&#10;which held it, and smoothed his plain features in silent amazement.&#10;Then he exclaimed in uncouth, querulous tones:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Had I not better consider WHY it is my lot, and so forth? Why,&#10;damn it, the causes are many. For one thing, if one has neighbours&#10;who neither live nor see things as oneself does, but are&#10;uncongenial, what does one do? One just leaves them, and clears&#10;out&#8212;more especially if one be neither a priest nor a magistrate.&#10;Yet YOU say that I had better consider why this is my lot. Do you&#10;think that YOU are the only man able to consider things, possessed&#10;of a brain?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And in an access of fury the speaker replaced his pipe, and sat&#10;frowning in silence. Vasili eyed his interlocutor&#39;s features as the&#10;firelight played red upon them, and, finally, said in an&#10;undertone:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, it is always so. We fail to get on with our neighbours,&#10;yet lack a charter of our own, so, having no roots to hold us, just&#10;fall to wandering, troubling other folk, and earning dislike!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The dislike of whom?&#34; gruffly queried the ex-soldier.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The dislike of everyone, as you yourself have said!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In answer the ex-soldier merely emitted a cloud of smoke which&#10;completely concealed his form. Yet Vasili&#39;s voice had in it an&#10;agreeable note, and was flexible and ingratiating, while&#10;enunciating its words roundly and distinctly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A mountain owl, one of those splendid brown creatures which have&#10;the crafty physiognomy of a cat, and the sharp grey ears of a&#10;mouse, made the forest echo with its obtrusive cry. A bird of this&#10;species I once encountered among the defile&#39;s crags, and as the&#10;creature sailed over my head it startled me with the glassy eyes&#10;which, as round as buttons, seemed to be lit from within with&#10;menacing fire. Indeed, for a moment or two I stood half-stupefied&#10;with terror, for I could not conceive what the creature was.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Whence did you get that splendid pipe?&#34; next asked Vasili as he&#10;rolled himself a cigarette. &#34;Surely it is a pipe of old German&#10;make?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You need not fear that I stole it,&#34; the ex-soldier responded as&#10;he removed it from his lips and regarded it proudly. &#34;It was given&#10;me by a woman.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;To which, with a whimsical wink, he added a sigh.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Tell me how it happened,&#34; said Vasili softly. Then he flung up&#10;his arms, and stretched himself with a despondent cry of:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ah, these nights here! Never again may God send me such bad&#10;ones! Try to sleep as one may, one never succeeds. Far easier,&#10;indeed, is it to sleep during the daytime, provided that one can&#10;find a shady spot. During such nights I go almost mad with&#10;thinking, and my heart swells and murmurs.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The ex-soldier, who had listened with mouth agape and eyebrows&#10;raised even higher than usual, responded to this:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It is the same with me. If one could only&#8212;What did you&#10;say?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;This last was addressed to myself, who had been about to remark,&#10;&#34;The same with me also,&#34; but on seeing the pair exchanging a&#10;strange glance (as though involuntarily they had surprised one&#10;another), had left the words unspoken. My companions then set&#10;themselves to a mutually eager questioning with respect to their&#10;respective identities, past experiences, places of origin, and&#10;destinations, even as though they had been two kinsmen who, meeting&#10;unexpectedly, had discovered for the first time their bond of&#10;relationship.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Meanwhile the black, fringed boughs of the pine trees hung&#10;stretched over the flames of the Molokans&#39; fire as though they&#10;would catch some of the fire&#39;s glow and warmth, or seize it&#10;altogether, and put it out. And when, at times, their red tongues&#10;projected beyond the corner of the barraque, they made the building&#10;look as though it had caught alight, and extended their glow even&#10;to the rivulet. Constantly the night was growing denser and more&#10;stifling; constantly it seemed to embrace the body more and more&#10;caressingly, until one bathed in it as in an ocean. Also, much as a&#10;wave removes dirt from the skin, so the softly vocal darkness&#10;seemed to refresh and cleanse the soul. For it is on such nights as&#10;that that the soul dons its finest raiment, and trembles like a&#10;bride at the expectation of something glorious.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You say that she had a squint?&#34; presently I heard Vasili&#10;continue in an undertone, and the ex-soldier slowly reply:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, she had one from childhood upwards&#8212;she had one from the&#10;day when a fall from a cart caused her to injure her eyes. Yet, if&#10;she had not always gone about with one of her eyes shaded, you&#10;would never have guessed the fact. Also, she was so neat and&#10;practical! And her kindness&#8212;well, it was kindness as inexhaustible&#10;as the water of that rivulet there; it was kindness of the sort&#10;that wished well to all the world, and to all animals, and to every&#10;beggar, and even to myself! So at last there gripped my heart the&#10;thought, &#39;Why should I not try a soldier&#39;s luck? She is the&#10;master&#39;s favourite&#8212;true; yet none the less the attempt shall be&#10;made by me.&#39; However, this way or that, always the reply was &#39;No&#39;;&#10;always she put out at me an elbow, and cut me short.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Vasili, lying prone upon his back, twitched his moustache, and&#10;chewed a stalk of grass. His eyes were fully open, and for the&#10;second time I perceived that one of them was larger than the other.&#10;The ex-soldier, seated near Vasili&#39;s shoulder, stirred the fire&#10;with a bit of charred stick, and sent sparks of gold flying to join&#10;the midges which were gliding to and fro over the blaze. Ever and&#10;anon night-moths subsided into the flames with a plop, crackled,&#10;and became changed into lumps of black. For my own part, I&#10;constructed a couch on a pile of pine boughs, and there lay down.&#10;And as I listened to the ex-soldier&#39;s familiar story, I recalled&#10;persons whom I had on one and another occasion remembered, and&#10;speeches which on one and another occasion had made an impression&#10;upon me.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But at last,&#34; the ex-soldier continued, &#34;I took heart of grace,&#10;and caught her in a barn. Pressing her into a corner, I said: &#39;Now&#10;let it be yes or no. Of, course it shall be as you wish, but&#10;remember that I am a soldier with a small stock of patience.&#39; Upon&#10;that she began to struggle and exclaim: &#39;What do you want? What do&#10;you want?&#39; until, bursting into tears like a girl, she said through&#10;her sobs: &#39;Do not touch me. I am not the sort of woman for you.&#10;Besides, I love another&#8212;not our master, but another, a workman, a&#10;former lodger of ours. Before he departed he said to me: &#34;Wait for&#10;me until I have found you a nice home, and returned to fetch you&#34;;&#10;and though it is seventeen years since I heard speech or whisper of&#10;him, and maybe he has since forgotten me, or fallen in love with&#10;someone else, or come to grief, or been murdered, you, who are a&#10;map, will understand that I must bide a little while longer.&#39; True,&#10;this offended me (for in what respect was I any worse than the&#10;other man?); yet also I felt sorry for her, and grieved that I&#10;should have wronged her by thinking her frivolous, when all the&#10;time there had been THIS at her heart. I drew back, therefore&#8212;I&#10;could not lay a finger upon her, though she was in my power. And at&#10;last I said: &#39;Good-bye! I am going away.&#39; &#39;Go,&#39; she replied. &#39;Yes,&#10;go for the love of Christ!&#39;&#8230; Wherefore, on the following evening I&#10;settled accounts with our master, and at dawn of a Sunday morning&#10;packed my wallet, took with me this pipe, and departed. &#39;Yes, take&#10;the pipe, Paul Ivanovitch,&#39; she said before my departure. &#39;Perhaps&#10;it will serve to keep you in remembrance of me&#8212;you whom henceforth&#10;I shall regard as a brother, and whom I thank.&#39;&#8230; As I walked away I&#10;was very nigh to tears, so keen was the pain in my heart. Aye, keen&#10;it was indeed!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You did right,&#34; Vasili remarked softly after a pause.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Things must always so befall. Always must it be a case either&#10;of &#39;Yes?&#39; &#39;Yes,&#39; and of folk coming together, or of &#39;No&#39; &#39;No,&#39; and&#10;of folk parting. And invariably the one person in the case grieves&#10;the other. Why should that be?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Emitting a cloud of grey smoke, the ex-soldier replied&#10;thoughtfully:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, I know I did right; but that right was done only at a&#10;great cost.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And always that too is the case,&#34; Vasili agreed. Then he&#10;added:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Generally such fortune falls to the lot of people who have&#10;tender consciences. He who values himself also values his fellows;&#10;but, unfortunately a man all too seldom values even himself.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;To whom are you referring? To you and myself?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;To our Russian folk in general.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Then you cannot have very much respect for Russia.&#34; The&#10;ex-soldier&#39;s tone had taken on a curious note. He seemed to be&#10;feeling both astonished at and grieved for his companion.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The other, however, did not reply; and after a few moments the&#10;ex-soldier softly concluded:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;So now you have heard my story.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;By this time the carpenters had ceased singing around the&#10;barraque, and let their fire die down until quivering on the wall&#10;of the edifice there was only a fiery-red patch, a patch barely&#10;sufficient to render visible the shadows of the rocks; while beside&#10;the fire there was seated only a tall figure with a black beard&#10;which had, grasped in its hands, a heavy cudgel, and, lying near&#10;its right foot, an axe. The figure was that of a watchman set by&#10;the carpenters to keep an eye upon ourselves, the appointed&#10;watchmen; though the fact in no way offended us.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Over the defile, in a ragged strip of sky, there were gleaming&#10;stars, while the rivulet was bubbling and purling, and from the&#10;obscurity of the forest there kept coming to our ears, now the&#10;cautious, rustling tread of some night animal, and now the mournful&#10;cry of an owl, until all nature seemed to be instinct with a secret&#10;vitality the sweet breath of which kept moving the heart to hunger&#10;insatiably for the beautiful.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Also, as I lay listening to the voice of the ex-soldier, a voice&#10;reminiscent of a distant tambourine, and to Vasili&#39;s pensive&#10;questions, I conceived a liking for the men, and began to detect&#10;that in their relations there was dawning something good and human.&#10;At the same time, the effect of some of Vasili&#39;s dicta on Russia&#10;was to arouse in me mingled feelings which impelled me at once to&#10;argue with him and to induce him to speak at greater length, with&#10;more clarity, on the subject of our mutual fatherland. Hence always&#10;I have loved that night for the visions which it brought to&#10;me&#8212;visions which still come back to me like a dear, familiar&#10;tale.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I thought of a student of Kazan whom I had known in the days of&#10;the past, of a young fellow from Viatka who, pale-browed, and&#10;sententious of diction, might almost have been brother to the&#10;ex-soldier himself. And once again I heard him declare that &#34;before&#10;all things must I learn whether or not there exists a God;&#10;pre-eminently must I make a beginning there.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And I thought, too, of a certain accoucheuse named Velikova who&#10;had been a comely, but reputedly gay, woman. And I remembered a&#10;certain occasion when, on a hill overlooking the river Kazan and&#10;the Arski Plain, she had stood contemplating the marshes below, and&#10;the far blue line of the Volga; until suddenly turning pale, she&#10;had, with tears of joy sparkling in her fine eyes, cried under her&#10;breath, but sufficiently loudly for all present to hear her:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ah, friends, how gracious and how fair is this land of ours!&#10;Come, let us salute that land for having deemed us worthy of&#10;residence therein!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Whereupon all present, including a deacon-student from the&#10;Ecclesiastical School, a Morduine from the Foreign College, a&#10;student of veterinary science, and two of our tutors, had done&#10;obeisance. At the same time I recalled the fact that subsequently&#10;one of the party had gone mad, and committed suicide.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Again, I recalled how once, on the Piani Bor [Liquor Wharf] by&#10;the river Kama, a tall, sandy young fellow with intelligent eyes&#10;and the face of a ne&#39;er-do-well had caught my attention. The day&#10;had been a hot, languorous Sunday on which all things had seemed to&#10;be exhibiting their better side, and telling the sun that it was&#10;not in vain that he was pouring out his brilliant potency, and&#10;diffusing his living gold; while the man of whom I speak had,&#10;dressed in a new suit of blue serge, a new cap cocked awry, and a&#10;pair of brilliantly polished boots, been standing at the edge of&#10;the wharf, and gazing at the brown waters of the Kama, the emerald&#10;expanse beyond them and the silver-scaled pools left behind by the&#10;tide. Until, as the sun had begun to sink towards the marshes on&#10;the other side of the river, and to become dissolved into streaks,&#10;the man had smiled with increasing rapture, and his face had glowed&#10;with creasing eagerness and delight; until finally he had snatched&#10;the cap from his head, flung it, with a powerful throw far out into&#10;the russet waters, and shouted: &#34;Kama, O my mother, I love you, and&#10;never will desert you!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And the last, and also the best, recollection of things seen&#10;before the night of which I speak was the recollection of an&#10;occasion when, one late autumn, I had been crossing the Caspian Sea&#10;on an old two-masted schooner laden with dried apricots, plums, and&#10;peaches. Sailing on her also she had had some hundred fishermen&#10;from the Bozhi Factory, men who, originally forest peasants of the&#10;Upper Volga, had been well-built, bearded, healthy, goodhumoured,&#10;animal-spirited young fellows, youngsters tanned with the wind, and&#10;salted with the sea water; youngsters who, after working hard at&#10;their trade, had been rejoicing at the prospect of returning home.&#10;And careering about the deck like youthful bears as ever and anon&#10;lofty, sharp-pointed waves had seized and tossed aloft the&#10;schooner, and the yards had cracked, and the taut-run rigging had&#10;whistled, and the sails had bellied into globes, and the howling&#10;wind had shaved off the white crests of billows, and partially&#10;submerged the vessel in clouds of foam.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And seated on the deck with his broad back resting against the&#10;mainmast there had been one young giant in particular. Clad in a&#10;white linen shirt and a pair of blue serge trousers, and innocent&#10;alike of beard and moustache, this young fellow had had full, red&#10;lips, blue, boyish, and exceedingly translucent eyes, and a face&#10;intoxicated in excelsis with the happiness of youth; while leaning&#10;across his knees as they had rested sprawling over the deck there&#10;had been a young female trimmer of fish, a wench as massive and&#10;tall as the young man himself, and a wench whose face had become&#10;tanned to roughness with the sun and wind, eyebrows dark, full, and&#10;as large as the wings of a swallow, breasts as firm as stone, and&#10;teats around which, as they projected from the folds of a red&#10;bodice, there had lain a pattern of blue veins.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The broad, iron-black palm of the young fellow&#39;s long, knotted&#10;hand had been resting on the woman&#39;s left breast, with the arm bare&#10;to the elbow; while in his right hand, as he had sat gazing&#10;pensively at the woman&#39;s robust figure, there had been grasped a&#10;tin mug from which some of the red liquor had scattered stains over&#10;the front of his linen shirt.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Meanwhile, around the pair there had been hovering some of the&#10;youngster&#39;s comrades, who, with coats buttoned to the throat, and&#10;caps gripped to prevent their being blown away by the wind, had&#10;employed themselves with scanning the woman&#39;s figure with envious&#10;eyes, and viewing her from either side. Nay, the shaggy green waves&#10;themselves had been stealing occasional glimpses at the picture as&#10;clouds had swirled across the sky, gulls had uttered their&#10;insatiable scream, and the sun, dancing on the foam-flecked waters,&#10;had vested the billows, now in tints of blue, now in natural tints&#10;as of flaming jewels.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In short, all the passengers on the schooner had been shouting&#10;and laughing and singing, while the great bearded peasants had also&#10;been paying assiduous court to a large leathern bottle which had&#10;lain ensconced on a heap of peach-sacks, with the result that the&#10;scene had come to have about it something of the antique, legendary&#10;air of the return of Stepan Razin from his Persian campaign.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At length the buffeting of the wind had caused an old man with a&#10;crooked nose set on a hairy, faun-like face to stumble over one of&#10;the woman&#39;s feet; whereupon he had halted, thrown up his head with&#10;nonsenile vigour, and exclaimed:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;May the devil fly away with you, you shameless hussy! Why lie&#10;sprawling about the deck like this? See, too, how exposed you&#10;are!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The woman had not stirred at the words&#8212;she had not even opened&#10;an eye; only over her lips there had passed a faint tremor. Whereas&#10;the young fellow had straightened himself, deposited his tin mug&#10;upon the deck, and cried loudly as he laid his disengaged hand upon&#10;the woman&#39;s breast.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ah, you envy me, do you, Yakim Petrov? Never mind, though you&#10;have done no great harm. But run no risks; do not look for needless&#10;trouble, for your day for sucking sugarplums is past.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Whereafter, raising both his hands, the young fellow had softly&#10;let them sink again upon the woman&#39;s bosom as he added&#10;triumphantly:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;These breasts could feed all Russia!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then, and only then, had the woman smiled a long, slow smile.&#10;And as she had done so everything in the vicinity had seemed to&#10;smile in unison, and to rise and fall in harmony with her&#10;bosom&#8212;yes, the whole vessel, and the vessel&#39;s freight. And at the&#10;moment when a particularly large wave had struck the bulwarks, and&#10;besprinkled all on board with spray, the woman had opened her dark&#10;eyes, looked kindly at the old man, and at the young fellow, and at&#10;the scene in general&#8212;then set herself to recover her bosom.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Nay,&#34; the young fellow had cried as he interposed to remove her&#10;hands. &#34;There is no need for that, there is no need for that. Let&#10;them ALL look.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Such the memories that came back to my recollection that night.&#10;Gladly I would have recounted them to my companions, but,&#10;unfortunately, these had, by now, succumbed to slumber. The&#10;ex-soldier, resting in a sitting posture, and snoring loudly, had&#10;his back prised against his wallet, his head sloped sideways, and&#10;his hands clasped upon his knees, while Vasili was lying on his&#10;back with his face turned upwards, his hands clasped behind his&#10;head, his dark, finely moulded brows raised a little, and his&#10;moustache erect. Also, he was weeping in his sleep&#8212;tears were&#10;coursing down his brown, sunburnt cheeks; tears which, in the&#10;moonlight, had in them something of the greenish tint of a&#10;chrysolite or sea water, and which, on such a manly face, looked&#10;strange indeed!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Still the rivulet was purling as it flowed, and the fire&#10;crackling; while bathed in the red glow of the flames there was&#10;sitting, bent forward, the dark, stonelike figure of the Molokans&#39;&#10;watchman, with the axe at his feet reflecting the radiant gleam of&#10;the moon in the sky above us.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;All the earth seemed to be sleeping as ever the waning stars&#10;seemed to draw nearer and nearer&#8230; .&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The slow length of the next day was dragged along amid an&#10;inertia born of the moist heat, the song of the river, and the&#10;intoxicating scents of forest and flowers. In short, one felt&#10;inclined to do nothing, from morn till night, save roam the defile&#10;without the exchanging of a word, the conceiving of a desire, or&#10;the formulating of a thought.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At sunset, when we were engaged in drinking tea by the fire, the&#10;ex-soldier remarked:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I hope that life in the next world will exactly resemble life&#10;in this spot, and be just as quiet and peaceful and immune from&#10;work. Here one needs but to sit and melt like butter and suffer&#10;neither from wrong nor anxiety.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then, as carefully he withdrew his pipe from his lips, and&#10;sighed, he added:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Aye! If I could but feel sure that life in the next world will&#10;be like life here, I would pray to God: &#39;For Christ&#39;s sake take my&#10;soul at the earliest conceivable moment.&#39;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What might suit YOU would not suit ME,&#34; Vasili thoughtfully&#10;observed. &#34;I would not always live such a life as this. I might do&#10;so for a time, but not in perpetuity.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ah, but never have you worked hard,&#34; grunted the&#10;ex-soldier.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In every way the evening resembled the previous one; there were&#10;to be observed the same luscious flooding of the defile with&#10;dove-coloured mist, the same flashing of the silver crags in the&#10;roseate twilight, the same rocking of the dense, warm forest&#39;s&#10;soft, leafy tree-tops, the same softening of the rocks&#39; outlines in&#10;the gloom, the same gradual uplift of shadows, the same chanting of&#10;the &#34;matchmaking&#34; river, the same routine on the part of the big,&#10;sleek carpenters around the barraque&#8212;a routine as slow and&#10;ponderous in its course as the movements of a drove of wild&#10;boars.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;More than once during the off hours of the day had we sought to&#10;make the carpenters&#39; acquaintance, to start a conversation with&#10;them, but always their answers had been given reluctantly, in&#10;monosyllables, and never had a discussion seemed likely to get&#10;under way without the whiteheaded foreman shouting to the&#10;particular member of the gang concerned: &#34;Hi, you, Pavlushka! Get&#10;back to work, there!&#34; Indeed, he, the foreman, had outdone all in&#10;his manifestations of dislike for our friendship, and as&#10;monotonously as though he had been minded to rival the rivulet as a&#10;songster, he had hummed his pious ditties, or else raised his&#10;snuffling voice to sing them with an ever-importunate measure of&#10;insistence, so that all day long those ditties had been coursing&#10;their way in a murky, melancholy-compelling flood. Indeed, as the&#10;foreman had stepped cautiously on thin legs from stone to stone&#10;during his ceaseless inspection of the work of his men, he had come&#10;to seem to have for his object the describing of an invisible,&#10;circular path, as a means of segregating us more securely than ever&#10;from the society of the carpenters.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Personally, however, I had no desire to converse with him, for&#10;his frozen eyes chilled and repelled me and from the moment when I&#10;had approached him, and seen him fold his hands behind him, and&#10;recoil a step as he inquired with suppressed sternness, &#34;What do&#10;you want?&#34; there had fallen away from me all further ambition to&#10;learn the nature of the songs which he sang.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The ex-soldier gazed at him resentfully, then said with an&#10;oath:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The old wizard and pilferer! Take my word for it that a lump of&#10;piety like that has got a pretty store put away somewhere.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Whereafter, as he lit his pipe and squinted in the direction of&#10;the carpenters, he added with stifled wrath:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The airs that the &#39;elect&#39; give themselves&#8212;the sons of&#10;bitches!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It is always so,&#34; commented Vasili with a resentment equal to&#10;the last speaker&#39;s. &#34;Yes, no sooner, with us, does a man accumulate&#10;a little money than he sticks his nose in the air, and falls to&#10;thinking himself a real barin.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why is it that you always say &#39;With us,&#39; and &#39;Among us,&#39; and so&#10;on?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Among us Russians, then, if you like it better.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I do like it better. For you are not a German, are you, nor a&#10;Tartar?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No. It is merely that I can see the faults in our Russian&#10;folk.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Upon that (not for the first time) the pair plunged into a&#10;discussion which had come so to weary them that now they spoke only&#10;indifferently, without effort.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The word &#39;faults&#39; is, I consider, an insult,&#34; began the&#10;ex-soldier as he puffed at his pipe. &#34;Besides, you don&#39;t speak&#10;consistently. Only this moment I observed a change in your&#10;terms.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;To what?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;To the term &#39;Russians.&#39;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What should you prefer?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A new sound floated into the defile as from some point on the&#10;steppe the sound of a bell summoning folk to the usual Saturday&#10;vigil service. Removing his pipe from his mouth, the ex-soldier&#10;listened for a moment or two. Then, at the third and last stroke of&#10;the bell, he doffed his cap, crossed himself with punctilious&#10;piety, and said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;There are not very many churches in these parts.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Whereafter he threw a glance across the river, and added&#10;venomously:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Those devils THERE don&#39;t cross themselves, the accursed&#10;Serbs!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Vasili looked at him, twisted a left-hand moustache, smoothed it&#10;again, regarded for a moment the sky and the defile, and sank his&#10;head.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The trouble with me,&#34; he remarked in an undertone, &#34;is that I&#10;can never remain very long in one place&#8212;always I keep fancying that&#10;I shall meet with better things elsewhere, always I keep hearing a&#10;bird singing in my heart, &#39;Do you go further, do you go&#10;further.&#39;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That bird sings in the heart of EVERY man,&#34; the ex-soldier&#10;growled sulkily.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With a glance at us both, Vasili laughed a subdued laugh.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;&#39;In the heart of every man&#39;?&#34; he repeated. &#34;Why, such a&#10;statement is absurd. For it means, does it not, that every one of&#10;us is an idler, every one of us is constantly waiting for something&#10;to turn up&#8212;that, in fact, no one of us is any better than, or able&#10;to do any better than, the folk whose sole utterance is &#39;Give unto&#10;us, pray give unto us&#39;? Yes, if that be the case, it is an&#10;unfortunate case indeed!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And again he laughed. Yet his eyes were sorrowful, and as the&#10;fingers of his right hand lay upon his knee they twitched as though&#10;they were longing to grasp something unseen.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The ex-soldier frowned and snorted. For my own part, however, I&#10;felt troubled for, and sorry for, Vasili. Presently he rose, broke&#10;into a soft whistle, and moved away by the side of the stream.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;His head is not quite right,&#34; muttered the ex-soldier as he&#10;winked in the direction of the retreating figure. &#34;Yes, I tell you&#10;that straight, for from the first it was clear to me. Otherwise,&#10;what could his words in depredation of Russia mean, when of Russia&#10;nothing the least hard or definite can be said? Who really knows&#10;her? What is she in reality, seeing that each of her provinces is a&#10;soul to itself, and no one could state which of the two Holy&#10;Mothers stands nearest to God&#8212;the Holy Mother of Smolensk, or the&#10;Holy Mother of Kazan?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For a while the speaker sat scraping greasy deposit from the&#10;bottom and sides of the kettle; and all that while he grumbled as&#10;though he had a grudge against someone. At length, however, he&#10;assumed an attitude of attention, with his neck stretched out as&#10;though to listen to some sound.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Hist!&#34; was his exclamation.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;What then followed, followed as unexpectedly as when, like an&#10;evil bird, a summer whirlwind suddenly sweeps up from the horizon,&#10;and discharges a bluish-black cloud in torrents of rain and hail,&#10;until everything is overwhelmed and battered to mud.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;That is to say, with much din of whistling and other sounds&#10;there now came pouring into the defile, and began to ascend the&#10;trail beside the stream, a straggling procession of some thirty&#10;workmen with, gleaming dully in the hands of their leading files,&#10;flagons of vodka, and, suspended on the backs and shoulders of&#10;others, wallets and bags of bread and other comestibles, and, in&#10;two instances, poised on the heads of yet other processionists,&#10;large black cauldrons the effect of which was to make their bearers&#10;look like mushrooms.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;A vedro [2 3/4 gallons] and a half to the cauldron!&#34; whispered&#10;the ex-soldier with a computative grunt as he gained his feet.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, a vedro and a half,&#34; he repeated. As he spoke the tip of&#10;his tongue protruded until it rested on the under-lip of his&#10;half-opened mouth. In his face there was a curiously thirsty, gross&#10;expression, and his attitude, as he stood there, was that of one&#10;who had just received a blow, and was about to cry out in&#10;consequence.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Meanwhile the defile rumbled like a barrel into which heavy&#10;weights are being dropped, for one of the newcomers was beating an&#10;empty tin pail, and another one whistling in a manner the tossed&#10;echoes of which drowned even the rivulet&#39;s murmur as nearer and&#10;nearer came the mob of men, a mob clad variously in black, grey, or&#10;russet, with sleeves rolled up, and heads, in many cases, bare save&#10;for their own towsled, dishevelled locks, and bodies bent with&#10;fatigue, or carried stumblingly along on legs bowed outwards.&#10;Meanwhile, as the dull, polyphonous roar of voices swept through&#10;the neck of the defile, a man shouted in broken, but truculent,&#10;accents:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I say no! Fiddlesticks! Not a man is there who could drink more&#10;than a vedro of &#39;blood-and-sweat&#39; in a day.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;A man could drink a lake of it.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No, a vedro and a half. That is the proper reckoning.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Aye, a vedro and a half.&#34; And the ex-soldier, as he repeated&#10;the words, spoke both as though he were an expert in the matter and&#10;as though he felt for the matter a touch of respect. Then, lurching&#10;forward like a man pushed by the scruff of the neck, he crossed the&#10;rivulet, intercepted the crowd, and became swallowed up in its&#10;midst.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Around the barraque the carpenters (the foreman ever glimmering&#10;among them) were hurriedly collecting tools. Presently Vasili&#10;returned&#8212;his right hand thrust into his pocket, and his left&#10;holding his cap.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Before long those fellows will be properly drunk!&#34; he said with&#10;a frown. &#34;Ah, that vodka of ours! It is a perfect curse!&#34; Then to&#10;me: &#34;Do YOU drink?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No,&#34; I replied.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Thank God for that! If one does not drink one will never really&#10;get into trouble.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For a moment he gazed gloomily in the direction of the&#10;newcomers. Then he said without moving, without even looking at&#10;me:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You have remarkable eyes, young fellow. Also, they seem&#10;familiar to me&#8212;I have seen them somewhere before. Possibly that&#10;happened in a dream, though I cannot be sure. Where do you come&#10;from?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I answered, but, after scanning me perplexedly, he shook his&#10;head.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No,&#34; he remarked. &#34;I have never visited that part of the&#10;country, or indeed, been so far from home.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But this place is further still?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Further still?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes&#8212;from Kursk.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He laughed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I must tell you the truth,&#34; he said. &#34;I am not a Kurskan at&#10;all, but a Pskovian. The reason why I told the ex-soldier that I&#10;was from Kursk was that I neither liked him nor cared to tell him&#10;the whole truth-he was not worth the trouble. And as for my real&#10;name, it is Paul, not Vasili&#8212;Paul Nikolaev Silantiev&#8212;and is so&#10;marked on my passport (for a passport, and a passport quite in&#10;order, I have got).&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And why are you on your travels?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;For the reason that I am so&#8212;I can say no more. I look back from&#10;a given place, and wave my hand, and am gone again as a feather&#10;floats before the wind.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Silence!&#34; a threatening voice near the barraque broke in. &#34;I am&#10;the foreman here.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The voice of the ex-soldier replied:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What workmen are these of yours? They are mere sectarians,&#10;fellows who are for ever singing hymns.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;To which someone else added:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Besides, old devil that you are, aren&#39;t you bound to finish all&#10;building work before the beginning of a Sunday?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Let us throw their tools into the stream.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, and start a riot,&#34; was Silantiev&#39;s comment as he squatted&#10;before the embers of the fire.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Around the barraque, picked out against the yellow of its&#10;framework, a number of dark figures were surging to and fro as&#10;around a conflagration. Presently we heard something smashed to&#10;pieces&#8212;at all events, we heard the cracking and scraping of wood&#10;against stone, and then the strident, hilarious command:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Hold on there! I&#39;LL soon put things to rights! Carpenters, just&#10;hand over the saw!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Apparently there were three men in charge of the proceedings:&#10;the one a red-bearded muzhik in a seaman&#39;s blouse; the second a&#10;tall man with hunched shoulders, thin legs, and long arms who kept&#10;grasping the foreman by the collar, shaking him, and bawling,&#10;&#34;Where are your lathes? Bring them out!&#34; (while noticeable also was&#10;a broad-shouldered young fellow in a ragged red shirt who kept&#10;thrusting pieces of scantling through the windows of the barraque,&#10;and shouting, &#34;Catch hold of these! Lay them out in a row!&#34;); and&#10;the third the ex-soldier himself. The last-named, as he jostled his&#10;way among the crowd, kept vociferating, viciously, virulently, and&#10;with a curious system of division of his syllables:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Aha-a, ra-abble, secta-arians. Yo-ou would have nothing to say&#10;to me, you Se-erbs! Yet I say to YOU: Go along, my chickens, for&#10;the re-est of us are ti-ired of you, and come to sa-ay so!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What does he want?&#34; asked Silantiev quietly as he lit a&#10;cigarette. &#34;Vodka? Oh, THEY&#39;LL give him vodka!&#8230; Yet are you not&#10;sorry for fellows of that stamp?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Through the blue tobacco-smoke he gazed into the glowing embers;&#10;until at last he took a charred stick, and collected the embers&#10;into a heap glowing red-gold like a bouquet of fiery poppies; and&#10;as he did so, his handsome eyes gleamed with just such a reverent&#10;affection, such a prayerful kindliness, as must have lurked in the&#10;eyes of primeval, nomadic man in the presence of the dancing,&#10;beneficent source of light and heat.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;At least I am sorry for such fellows,&#34; Vasili continued. &#34;Aye,&#10;the very thought of the many, many folk who have come to nothing!&#10;The very thought of it! Terrible, terrible!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A touch of daylight was still lingering on the tops of the&#10;mountains, but in the defile itself night was beginning to loom,&#10;and to lull all things to sleep&#8212;to incline one neither to speak&#10;oneself nor to listen to the dull clamour of those others on the&#10;opposite bank, where even to the murmur of the rivulet the&#10;distasteful din seemed to communicate a note of anger.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There the crowd had lit a huge bonfire, and then added to it a&#10;second one which, crackling, hissing, and emitting coils of&#10;bluish-tinted smoke, had fallen to vying with its fellow in lacing&#10;the foam of the rivulet with muslin-like patterns in red. As the&#10;mass of dark figures surged between the two flares an hilarious&#10;voice shouted to us the invitation:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Come over here, you! Don&#39;t be backward! Come over here, I&#10;say!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Upon which followed a clatter as of the smashing of a&#10;drinking-vessel, while from the red-bearded muzhik came a thick,&#10;raucous shout of:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;These fellows needed to be taught a lesson!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Almost at the same moment the foreman of the carpenters broke&#10;his way clear of the crowd, and, carefully crossing the rivulet by&#10;the stepping-stones which we had constructed, squatted down upon&#10;his heels by the margin, and with much puffing and blowing fell to&#10;rinsing his face, a face which in the murky firelight looked&#10;flushed and red.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I think that someone has given him a blow,&#34; hazarded Silantiev&#10;sotto voce.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And when the foreman rose to approach us this proved to be the&#10;case, for then we saw that dripping from his nose, and meandering&#10;over his moustache and soaked white beard, there was a stream of&#10;dark blood which had spotted and streaked his shirt-front.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Peace to this gathering!&#34; he said gravely as, pressing his left&#10;hand to his stomach, he bowed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And we pray your indulgence,&#34; was Silantiev&#39;s response, though&#10;he did not raise his eyes as he spoke. &#34;Pray be seated.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Small, withered, and, for all but his blood-stained shirt,&#10;scrupulously clean, the old man reminded me of certain pictures of&#10;old-time hermits, and the more so since either pain or shame or the&#10;gleam of the firelight had caused his hitherto dead eyes to gather&#10;life and grow brighter&#8212;aye, and sterner. Somehow, as I looked at&#10;him, I felt awkward and abashed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A cough twisted his broad nose. Then he wiped his beard on the&#10;palm of his hand, and his hand on his knee; whereafter, as he&#10;stretched forth the pair of senile, dark-coloured hands, and held&#10;them over the embers, he said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;How cold the water of the rivulet is! It is absolutely&#10;icy.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With a glance from under his brows Silantiev inquired:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Are you very badly hurt?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No. Merely a man caught me a blow on the bridge of the nose,&#10;where the blood flows readily. Yet, as God knows, he will gain&#10;nothing by his act, whereas the suffering which he has caused me&#10;will go to swell my account with the Holy Spirit.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As the man spoke he glanced across the rivulet. On the opposite&#10;bank two men were staggering along, and drunkenly bawling the tipsy&#10;refrain:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;In the du-u-uok let me die, In the au-autumn time!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Aye, long is it since I received a blow,&#34; the old man&#10;continued, scanning the two revellers from under his hand. &#34;Twenty&#10;years it must be since last I did so. And now the blow was struck&#10;for nothing, for no real fault.. You see, I have been allowed no&#10;nails for the doing of the work, and have been obliged to make use&#10;of wooden clamps for most of it, while battens also have not been&#10;forthcoming; and, this being so, it was through no remissness of&#10;mine that the work could not be finished by sunset tonight. I&#10;suspect, too, that, to eke out its wages, that rabble has been&#10;thieving, with the eldest leading the rest. And that, again, is not&#10;a thing for which I can be held responsible. True, this is a&#10;Government job, and some of those fellows are young, and young,&#10;hungry fellows such as they will (may they be forgiven!) steal,&#10;since everyone hankers to get something in return for a very&#10;little. But, once more, how is that my fault? Yes, that rabble must&#10;be a regular set of rascals! Just now they deprived my eldest son&#10;of a saw, of a brand-new saw; and thereafter they spilt my blood,&#10;the blood of a greybeard!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Here his small, grey face contracted into wrinkles, and, closing&#10;his eyes, he sobbed a dry, grating sob.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Silantiev fidgeted&#8212;then sighed. Presently the old man looked at&#10;him, blew his nose, wiped his hand upon his trousers, and said&#10;quietly:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Somewhere, I think, I have seen you before.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That is so. You saw me one evening when I visited your&#10;settlement for the mending of a thresher.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, yes. That is where I DID see you. It was you, was it not?&#10;Well, do you still disagree with me?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;To which the old man added with a nod and a smile:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;See how well I remember your words! You are, I imagine, still&#10;of the same opinion?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;How should I not be?&#34; responded Silantiev dourly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ah, well! Ah, well!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And the old man stretched his hands over the fire once more,&#10;discoloured hands the thumbs of which were curiously bent outwards&#10;and splayed, and, seemingly, unable to move in harmony with the&#10;fingers.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The ex-soldier shouted across the river:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The land here is easy to work, and makes the people lazy. Who&#10;would care to live in such a region? Who would care to come to it?&#10;Much rather would I go and earn a living on difficult land.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The old man paid no heed, but said to Silantiev&#8212;said to him with&#10;an austere, derisive smile:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Do you STILL think it necessary to struggle against what has&#10;been ordained of God? Do you STILL think that long-suffering is&#10;bad, and resistance good? Young man, your soul is weak indeed: and&#10;remember that it is only the soul that can overcome Satan.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In response Silantiev rose to his feet, shook his fist at the&#10;old man, and shouted in a rough, angry voice, a voice that was not&#10;his own:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;All that I have heard before, and from others besides yourself.&#10;The truth is that I hold all you father-confessors in abhorrence.&#10;Moreover,&#34; (this last was added with a violent oath) &#34;it is not&#10;Satan that needs to be resisted, but such devil&#39;s ravens, such&#10;devil&#39;s vampires, as YOU.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Which said, he kicked a stone away from the fire, thrust his&#10;hands into his pockets, and turned slowly on his heel, with his&#10;elbows pressed close to his sides. Nevertheless the old man, still&#10;smiling, said to me in an undertone:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;He is proud, but that will not last for long.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why not?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Because I know in advance that&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Breaking off short, he turned his head upon his shoulder, and&#10;sat listening to some shouting that was going on across the river.&#10;Everyone in that quarter was drunk, and, in particular, someone&#10;could be heard bawling in a tone of challenge:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh? I, you say? A-a-ah! Then take that!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Silantiev, stepping lightly from stone to stone, crossed the&#10;river. Then he mingled&#8212;a conspicuous figure (owing to his apparent&#10;handlessness)&#8212;with the crowd. Somehow, on his departure, I felt ill&#10;at ease.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Twitching his fingers as though performing a conjuring trick,&#10;the old man continued to sit with his hands stretched over the&#10;embers. By this time his nose had swollen over the bridge, and&#10;bruises risen under his eyes which tended to obscure his vision.&#10;Indeed, as he sat there, sat mouthing with dark, bestreaked lips&#10;under a covering of hoary beard and moustache, I found that his&#10;bloodstained, disfigured, wrinkled, as it were &#34;antique&#34; face&#10;reminded me more than ever of those of great sinners of ancient&#10;times who abandoned this world for the forest and the desert.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I have seen many proud folk,&#34; he continued with a shake of his&#10;hatless head and its sparse hairs. &#34;A fire may burn up quickly, and&#10;continue to burn fiercely, yet, like these embers, become turned to&#10;ashes, and so lie smouldering till dawn. Young man, there you have&#10;something to think of. Nor are they merely my words. They are the&#10;words of the Holy Gospel itself.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Ever descending, ever weighing more heavily upon us, the night&#10;was as black and hot and stifling as the previous one had been,&#10;albeit as kindly as a mother. Still the two fires on the opposite&#10;bank of the rivulet were aflame, and sending hot blasts of vapour&#10;across a seeming brook of gold.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Folding his arms upon his breast, the old man tucked the palms&#10;of his hands into his armpits, and settled himself more&#10;comfortably. Nevertheless, when I made as though to add more twigs&#10;and shavings to the embers he exclaimed imperiously:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;There is no need for that.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why is there not?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Because that would cause the fire to be seen, and bring some of&#10;those men over here.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Again, as he kicked away some boughs which I had just broken up,&#10;he repeated:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;There is no need for that, I tell you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Presently, there approached us through the shimmering fire light&#10;on the opposite bank two carpenters with boxes on their backs, and&#10;axes in their hands.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Are all the rest of our men gone?&#34; inquired the foreman of the&#10;newcomers.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes,&#34; replied one of them, a tall man with a drooping moustache&#10;and no beard.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well, &#39;shun evil, and good will result.&#39;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Aye, and we likewise wish to depart.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But a task ought not to be left unfinished. At dinner-time I&#10;sent Olesha to say that none of those fellows had better be&#10;released from work; but released they have been, and now the result&#10;is apparent! Presently, when they have drunk a little more of their&#10;poison, they will fire the barraque.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Every time that the first of the two carpenters inhaled the&#10;smoke of my cigarette he spat into the embers, while the other man,&#10;a young fellow as plump as a female baker, sank his towsled head&#10;upon his breast as soon as he sat down, and fell asleep.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Next, the clamour across the rivulet subsided for awhile. But&#10;suddenly I heard the ex-soldier exclaim in drunken, singsong&#10;accents which came from the very centre of the tumult:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Hi, do you answer me! How comes it that you have no respect for&#10;Russia? Is not Riazan a part of Russia? What is Russia, then, I&#10;should like to know?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;A tavern,&#34; the foreman commented quietly; whereafter, turning&#10;to me, he added more loudly:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I say this of such fellows&#8212;that a tavern&#8230; But what a noise&#10;those roisterers are making, to be sure!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The young fellow in the red shirt had just shouted:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Hi, there, soldier! Seize him by the throat! Seize him, seize&#10;him!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;While from Silantiev had come the gruff retort:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What? Do you suppose that you are hunting a pack of&#10;hounds?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Here, answer me!&#34; was the next shouted utterance&#8212;it came from&#10;the ex-soldier&#8212;whereupon the old man remarked to me in an&#10;undertone:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It would seem that a fight is brewing.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Rising, I moved in the direction of the uproar. As I did so, I&#10;heard the old man say softly to his companions:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;He too is gone, thank God!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Suddenly there surged towards me from the opposite bank a crowd&#10;of men. Belching, hiccuping, and grunting, they seemed to be&#10;carrying or dragging in their midst some heavy weight. Presently a&#10;woman&#39;s voice screamed, &#34;Ya-av-sha!&#34; and other voices raised&#10;mingled shouts of &#34;Throw him in! Give him a thrashing!&#34; and &#34;Drag&#10;him along!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The next moment we saw Silantiev break out of the crowd,&#10;straighten himself, swing his right fist in the air, and hurl&#10;himself at the crowd again. As he did so the young fellow in the&#10;red shirt raised a gigantic arm, and there followed the sound of a&#10;muffled, grisly blow. Staggering backwards, Silantiev slid silently&#10;into the water, and lay there at my feet.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That&#39;s right!&#34; was the comment of someone.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For a moment or two the clamour subsided a little, and during&#10;that moment or two one&#39;s ears once more became laved with the sweet&#10;singsong of the river. Shortly afterwards someone threw into the&#10;water a huge stone, and someone else laughed in a dull way.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As I was bending to look at Silantiev some of the men jostled&#10;me. Nevertheless, I continued to struggle to raise him from the&#10;spot where, half in and half out of the water, he lay with his head&#10;and breast resting against the stepping-stones.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You have killed him!&#34; next I shouted&#8212;not because I believed the&#10;statement to be true, but because I had a mind to frighten into&#10;sobriety the men who were impeding me.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Upon this someone exclaimed in a faltering, sobered tone:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Surely not?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As for the young fellow in the red shirt, he passed me by with a&#10;braggart, resentful shout of:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well? He had no right to insult me. Why should he have said&#10;that I was a nuisance to the whole country?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And someone else shouted:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Where is the ex-soldier? Who is the watchman here?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Bring a light,&#34; was the cry of a third.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Yet all these voices were more sober, more subdued, more&#10;restrained than they had been, and presently a little muzhik whose&#10;poll was swathed in a red handkerchief stooped and raised&#10;Silantiev&#39;s head. But almost as instantly he let it fall again,&#10;and, dipping his hands into the water, said gravely:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You have killed him. He is dead.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At the moment I did not believe the words; but presently, as I&#10;stood watching how the water coursed between Silantiev&#39;s legs, and&#10;turned them this way and that, and made them stir as though they&#10;were striving to divest themselves of the shabby old boots, I&#10;realised with all my being that the hands which were resting in&#10;mine were the hands of a corpse. And, true enough, when I released&#10;them they slapped down upon the surface like wet dish-cloths.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Until now, about a dozen men had been standing on the bank to&#10;observe what was toward, but as soon as the little muzhik&#39;s words&#10;rang out these men recoiled, and, with jostlings, began to vent, in&#10;subdued, uneasy tones, cries of:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Who was it first struck him?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;This will lose us our jobs.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It was the soldier that first started the racket.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, that is true.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Let us go and denounce him.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As for the young fellow in the red shirt, he cried:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I swear on my honour, mates, that the affair was only a&#10;quarrel.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;To hit a man with a bludgeon is more than a quarrel.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It was a stone that was used, not a bludgeon.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The soldier ought to&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A woman&#39;s high-pitched voice broke in with a plaintive cry&#10;of:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Good Lord! Always something happens to us!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As for myself, I felt stunned and hurt as I seated myself upon&#10;the stepping-stones; and though everything was plain to my sight,&#10;nothing was plain to my understanding, while in my breast a strange&#10;emptiness was present, save that the clamour of the bystanders&#10;aroused me to a certain longing to outshout them all, to send forth&#10;my voice into the night like the voice of a brazen trumpet.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Presently two other men approached us. In the hand of the first&#10;was a torch which he kept waving to and fro to prevent its being&#10;extinguished, and whence, therefore, he kept strewing showers of&#10;golden sparks. A fair-headed little fellow, he had a body as thin&#10;as a pike when standing on its tail, a grey, stonelike countenance&#10;that was deeply sunken between the shoulders, a mouth perpetually&#10;half-agape, and round, owlish-looking eyes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As he approached the corpse he bent forward with one hand upon&#10;his knee to throw the more light upon Silantiev&#39;s bruised head and&#10;body. That head was resting turned upon the shoulder, and no longer&#10;could I recognise the once handsome Cossack face, so buried was the&#10;jaunty forelock under a clot of black-red mud, and concealed by a&#10;swelling which had made its appearance above the left ear. Also,&#10;since the mouth and moustache had been bashed aside the teeth lay&#10;bared in a twisted, truly horrible smile, while, as the most&#10;horrible point of all, the left eye was hanging from its socket,&#10;and, become hideously large, gazing, seemingly, at the inner pocket&#10;of the flap of Silantiev&#39;s pea-jacket, whence there was protruding&#10;a white edging of paper.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Slowly the torch holder described a circle of fire in the air,&#10;and thereby sprinkled a further shower of sparks over the poor&#10;mutilated face, with its streaks of shining blood. Then he muttered&#10;with a smack of the lips:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You can see for yourselves who the man is.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As he spoke a few more sparks descended upon Silantiev&#39;s scalp&#10;and wet cheeks, and went out, while the flare&#39;s reflection so&#10;played in the ball of Silantiev&#39;s eye as to communicate to it an&#10;added appearance of death.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Finally the torch holder straightened his back, threw his torch&#10;into the river, expectorated after it, and said to his companion as&#10;he smoothed a flaxen poll which, in the darkness, looked almost&#10;greenish:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Do you go to the barraque, and tell them that a man has been&#10;done to death.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No; I should be afraid to go alone.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Come, come! Nothing is there to be afraid of. Go, I tell&#10;you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But I would much rather not.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Don&#39;t be such a fool!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Suddenly there sounded over my head the quiet voice of the&#10;foreman.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I will accompany you,&#34; he said. Then he added disgustedly as he&#10;scraped his foot against a stone:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;How horrible the blood smells! It would seem that my very foot&#10;is smeared with it.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With a frown the fair-headed muzhik eyed him, while the foreman&#10;returned the muzhik&#39;s gaze with a scrutiny that never wavered.&#10;Finally the elder man commented with cold severity:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;All the mischief has come of vodka and tobacco, the devil&#39;s&#10;drugs.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Not only were the pair strangely alike, but both of them&#10;strangely resembled wizards, in that both were short of stature, as&#10;sharp-finished as gimlets, and as green-tinted by the darkness as&#10;tufts of lichen.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Let us go, brother,&#34; the foreman said. &#34;Go we with the Holy&#10;Spirit.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And, omitting even to inquire who had been killed, or even to&#10;glance at the corpse, or even to pay it the last salute demanded of&#10;custom, the foreman departed down the stream, while in his wake&#10;followed the messenger, a man who kept stumbling as he picked his&#10;way from stone to stone. Amid the gloom the pair moved as silently&#10;as ghosts.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The narrow-chested, fair-headed little muzhik then raked me with&#10;his eyes; whereafter he produced a cigarette from a tin box,&#10;snapped-to the lid of the box, struck a match (illuminating once&#10;more the face of the dead man), and applied the flame to the&#10;cigarette. Lastly he said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;This is the sixth murder which I have seen one thing and&#10;another commit.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;One thing and another commit?&#34; I queried.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The reply came only after a pause; when the little muzhik asked:&#10;&#34;What did you say? I did not quite catch it.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I explained that human beings, not inanimate entities, murdered&#10;human beings.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well, be they human beings or machinery or lightning or&#10;anything else, they are all one. One of my mates was caught in some&#10;machinery at Bakhmakh. Another one had his throat cut in a brawl.&#10;Another one was crushed against the bucket in a coal mine. Another&#10;one was&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Carefully though the man counted, he ended by erring in his&#10;reckoning to the extent of making his total &#34;five.&#34; Accordingly he&#10;re-computed the list&#8212;and this time succeeded in making the total&#10;amount to &#34;seven.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Never mind,&#34; he remarked with a sigh as he blew his cigarette&#10;into a red glow which illuminated the whole of his face. &#34;The truth&#10;is that I cannot always repeat the list correctly, just as I should&#10;like. Were I older than I am, I too should contrive to get finished&#10;off; for old-age is a far from desirable thing. Yes, indeed! But,&#10;as things are, I am still alive, nor, thank the Lord, does anything&#10;matter very much.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Presently, with a nod towards Silantiev, he continued:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Even now HIS kinsfolk or his wife may be looking for news of&#10;him, or a letter from him. Well, never again will he write, and as&#10;likely as not his kinsfolk will end by saying to themselves: &#39;He&#10;has taken to bad ways, and forgotten his family.&#39; Yes, good&#10;sir.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;By this time the clamour around the barraque had ceased, and the&#10;two fires had burnt themselves out, and most of the men dispersed.&#10;From the smooth yellow walls of the barraque dark, round,&#10;knot-holes were gazing at the rivulet like eyes. Only in a single&#10;window without a frame was there visible a faint light, while at&#10;intervals there issued thence fragmentary, angry exclamations such&#10;as:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Look sharp there, and deal! Clubs will be the winners.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ah! Here is a trump!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Indeed? What luck, damn it!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The fair-headed muzhik blew the ashes from his cigarette, and&#10;observed:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No such thing is there at cards as luck&#8212;only skill.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At this juncture we saw approaching us softly from across the&#10;rivulet a young carpenter who wore a moustache. He halted beside&#10;us, and drew a deep breath.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well, mate?&#34; the fair-headed muzhik inquired.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Would you mind giving me something to smoke?&#34; the carpenter&#10;asked. The obscurity caused him to look large and shapeless, though&#10;his manner of speaking was bashful and subdued.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Certainly. Here is a cigarette.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Christ reward you! Today my wife forgot to bring my tobacco,&#10;and my grandfather has strict ideas on the subject of smoking.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Was it he who departed just now? It was.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As the carpenter inhaled a whiff he continued:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I suppose that man was beaten to death?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;He was&#8212;to death.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For a while the pair smoked in silence. The hour was past&#10;midnight.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Over the defile the jagged strip of sky which roofed it looked&#10;like a river of blue flowing at an immense height above the&#10;night-enveloped earth, and bearing the brilliant stars on its&#10;smooth current.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Quieter and quieter was everything growing; more and more was&#10;everything becoming part of the night&#8230; .&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;One might have thought that nothing particular had happened.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 19, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/3920')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('Kalinin'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;Whistling from off the sea, the wind was charged with moist,&#10;salt spray, and dashing foaming billows ashore with their white&#10;manes full of snakelike, gleaming black ribands of seaweed, and&#10;causing the rocks to rumble angrily in response, and the trees to&#10;rustle with a dry, agitated sound as their tops swayed to and fro,&#10;and their trunks bent earthwards as though they would fain reeve up&#10;their roots, and betake them whither the mountains stood veiled in&#10;a toga of heavy, dark mist.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Over the sea the clouds were hurrying towards the land as ever&#10;and anon they rent themselves into strips, and revealed fathomless&#10;abysses of blue wherein the autumn sun burned uneasily, and sent&#10;cloud-shadows gliding over the puckered waste of waters, until, the&#10;shore reached, the wind further harried the masses of vapour&#10;towards the sharp flanks of the mountains, and, after drawing them&#10;up and down the slopes, relegated them to clefts, and left them&#10;steaming there.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There was about the whole scene a louring appearance, an&#10;appearance as though everything were contending with everything, as&#10;now all things turned sullenly dark, and now all things emitted a&#10;dull sheen which almost blinded the eyes. Along the narrow road, a&#10;road protected from the sea by a line of wave-washed dykes, some&#10;withered leaves of oak and wild cherry were scudding in mutual&#10;chase of one another; with the general result that the combined&#10;sounds of splashing and rustling and howling came to merge&#10;themselves into a single din which issued as a song with a rhythm&#10;marked by the measured blows of the waves as they struck the&#10;rocks.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Zmiulan, the King of the Ocean, is abroad!&#34; shouted my fellow&#10;traveller in my ear. He was a tall, round-shouldered man of&#10;childishly chubby features and boyishly bright, transparent&#10;eyes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;WHO do you say is abroad?&#34; I queried.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;King Zmiulan.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Never having heard of the monarch, I made no reply.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The extent to which the wind buffeted us might have led one to&#10;suppose that its primary objective was to deflect our steps, and&#10;turn them in the direction of the mountains. Indeed, at times its&#10;pressure was so strong that we had no choice but to halt, to turn&#10;our backs to the sea, and, with feet planted apart, to prise&#10;ourselves against our sticks, and so remain, poised on three legs,&#10;until we were past any risk of being overwhelmed with the soft&#10;incubus of the tempest, and having our coats torn from our&#10;shoulders.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At intervals such gasps would come from my companion that he&#10;might well have been standing on the drying-board of a bath. Nor,&#10;as they did so, was his appearance aught but comical, seeing that&#10;his ears, appendages large and shaggy like a dog&#39;s, and&#10;indifferently shielded with a shabby old cap, kept being pushed&#10;forward by the wind until his small head bore an absurd resemblance&#10;to a china bowl. And that, to complete the resemblance, his long&#10;and massive nose, a feature grossly disproportionate to the rest of&#10;his diminutive face, might equally well have passed for the spout&#10;of the receptacle indicated.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Yet a face out of the common it was, like the whole of his&#10;personality. And this was the fact which had captivated me from the&#10;moment when I had beheld him participating in a vigil service held&#10;in the neighbouring church of the monastery of New Athos. There,&#10;spare, but with his withered form erect, and his head slightly&#10;tilted, he had been gazing at the Crucifix with a radiant smile,&#10;and moving his thin lips in a sort of whispered, confidential,&#10;friendly conversation with the Saviour. Indeed, so much had the&#10;man&#39;s smooth, round features (features as beardless as those of a&#10;Skopetz [A member of the Skoptzi, a non-Orthodox sect the members&#10;of which &#34;do make of themselves eunuchs for the Lord&#39;s sake.&#34;],&#10;save for two bright tufts at the corners of the mouth) been&#10;instinct with intimacy, with a consciousness of actually being in&#10;the presence of the Son of God, that the spectacle, transcending&#10;anything of the kind that my eyes had before beheld, had led me,&#10;with its total absence of the customary laboured, servile,&#10;pusillanimous attitude towards the Almighty which I had generally&#10;found to be the rule, to accord the man my whole interest, and, as&#10;long as the service had lasted, to keep an eye upon one who could&#10;thus converse with God without rendering Him constant obeisance, or&#10;again and again making the sign of the cross, or invariably making&#10;it to the accompaniment of groans and tears which had always&#10;hitherto obtruded itself upon my notice.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Again had I encountered the man when I had had supper at the&#10;workmen&#39;s barraque, and then proceeded to the monastery&#39;s&#10;guest-chamber. Seated at a table under a circle of light falling&#10;from a lamp suspended from the ceiling, he had gathered around him&#10;a knot of pilgrims and their women, and was holding forth in low,&#10;cheerful tones that yet had in them the telling, incisive note of&#10;the preacher, of the man who frequently converses with his fellow&#10;men.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;One thing it may be best always to disclose,&#34; he was saying,&#10;&#34;and another thing to conceal. If aught in ourselves seems harmful&#10;or senseless, let us put to ourselves the question: &#39;Why is this&#10;so?&#39; Contrariwise ought a prudent man never to thrust himself&#10;forward and say: &#39;How discreet am I!&#39; while he who makes a parade&#10;of his hard lot, and says, &#39;Good folk, see ye and hear how bitter&#10;my life is,&#39; also does wrong.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Here a pilgrim with a black beard, a brigand&#39;s dark eyes, and&#10;the wasted features of an ascetic rose from the further side of the&#10;table, straightened his virile frame, and said in a dull voice:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My wife and one of my children were burnt to death through the&#10;falling of an oil lamp. On THAT ought I to keep silence?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;No answer followed. Only someone muttered to himself:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What? Again?&#34;: until the first speaker, the speaker seated near&#10;the corner of the table, launched into the oppressive lull the&#10;unhesitating reply:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That of which you speak may be taken to have been a punishment&#10;by God for sin.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What? For a sin committed by one three years of age (for,&#10;indeed, my little son was no more)? The accident happened of his&#10;pulling down a lamp upon himself, and of my wife seizing him, and&#10;herself being burnt to death. She was weak, too, for but eleven&#10;days had passed since her confinement.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No. What I mean is that in that accident you see a punishment&#10;for sins committed by the child&#39;s father and mother.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;This reply from the corner came with perfect confidence. The&#10;black-bearded man, however, pretended not to hear it, but spread&#10;out his hands as though parting the air before him, and proceeded&#10;hurriedly, breathlessly to detail the manner in which his wife and&#10;little one had met their deaths. And all the time that he was doing&#10;so one had an inkling that often before had he recounted his&#10;narrative of horror, and that often again would he repeat it. His&#10;shaggy black eyebrows, as he delivered his speech, met in a single&#10;strip, while the whites of his eyes grew bloodshot, and their dull,&#10;black pupils never ceased their nervous twitching.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Presently the gloomy recital was once more roughly,&#10;unceremoniously broken in upon by the cheerful voice of the&#10;Christ-loving pilgrim.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It is not right, brother,&#34; the voice said, &#34;to blame God for&#10;untoward accidents, or for mistakes and follies committed by&#10;ourselves.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But if God be God, He is responsible for all things.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Not so. Concede to yourself the faculty of reason.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Pah! What avails reason if it cannot make me understand?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Cannot make you understand WHAT?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The main point, the point why MY wife had to be burnt rather&#10;than my neighbour&#39;s?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Somewhere an old woman commented in spitefully distinct&#10;tones:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh ho, ho! This man comes to a monastery, and starts railing as&#10;soon as he gets there!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Flashing his eyes angrily, the black-bearded man lowered his&#10;head like a bull. Then, thinking better of his position, and&#10;contenting himself with a gesture, he strode swiftly, heavily&#10;towards the door. Upon this the Christ-loving pilgrim rose with a&#10;swaying motion, bowed to everyone present, and set about following&#10;his late interlocutor.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It has all come of a broken heart,&#34; he said with a smile as he&#10;passed me. Yet somehow the smile seemed to lack sympathy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With a disapproving air someone else remarked:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That fellow&#39;s one thought is to enlarge and to enlarge upon his&#10;tale.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, and to no purpose does he do so,&#34; added the Christ-loving&#10;pilgrim as he halted in the doorway. &#34;All that he accomplishes by&#10;it is to weary himself and others alike. Such experiences are far&#10;better put behind one.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Presently I followed the pair into the forecourt, and near the&#10;entrance-gates heard a voice say quietly:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Do not disturb yourself, good father.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Nevertheless&#34; (the second voice was that of the porter of the&#10;monastery, Father Seraphim, a strapping Vetlugan) &#34;a spectre walks&#10;here nightly.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Never mind if it does. As regards myself, no spectre would&#10;touch me.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Here I moved in the direction of the gates.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Who comes there?&#34; Seraphim inquired as he thrust a hairy and&#10;uncouth, but infinitely kindly, face close to mine. &#34;Oh, it is the&#10;young fellow from Nizhni Novgorod! You are wasting your time, my&#10;good sir, for the women have all gone to bed.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With which he laughed and chuckled like a bear.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Beyond the wall of the forecourt the stillness of the autumn&#10;night was the languid inertia of a world exhausted by summer, and&#10;the withered grass and other objects of the season were exhaling a&#10;sweet and bracing odour, and the trees looking like fragments of&#10;cloud where motionless they hung in the moist, sultry air. Also, in&#10;the darkness the half-slumbering sea could be heard soughing as it&#10;crept towards the shore while over the sky lay a canopy of mist,&#10;save at the point where the moon&#39;s opal-like blur could be descried&#10;over the spot where that blur&#39;s counterfeit image glittered and&#10;rocked on the surface of the dark waters.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Under the trees there was set a bench whereon I could discern&#10;there to be resting a human figure. Approaching the figure, I&#10;seated myself beside it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Whence, comrade?&#34; was my inquiry.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;From Voronezh. And you?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A Russian is never adverse to talking about himself. It would&#10;seem as though he is never sure of his personality, as though he is&#10;ever yearning to have that personality confirmed from some source&#10;other than, extraneous to, his own ego. The reason for this must be&#10;that we Russians live diffused over a land of such vastness that,&#10;the more we grasp the immensity of the same, the smaller do we come&#10;to appear in our own eyes; wherefore, traversing, as we do, roads&#10;of a length of a thousand versts, and constantly losing our way, we&#10;come to let slip no opportunity of restating ourselves, and setting&#10;forth all that we have seen and thought and done.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Hence, too, must it be that in conversations one seems to hear&#10;less of the note of &#34;I am I&#34; than of the note of &#34;Am I really and&#10;truly myself?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What may be your name?&#34; next I inquired of the figure on the&#10;bench.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;A name of absolute simplicity&#8212;the name of Alexei Kalinin.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You are a namesake of mine, then.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Indeed? Is that so?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With which, tapping me on the knee, the figure added:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Come, then, namesake. &#39;I have mortar, and you have water, so&#10;together let us paint the town.&#39;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Murmuring amid the silence could be heard small, light waves&#10;that were no more than ripples. Behind us the busy clamour of the&#10;monastery had died down, and even Kalinin&#39;s cheery voice seemed&#10;subdued by the influence of the night&#8212;it seemed to have in it less&#10;of the note of self-confidence.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My mother was a wet-nurse,&#34; he went on to volunteer, &#34;and I her&#10;only child. When I was twelve years of age I was, owing to my&#10;height, converted into a footman. It happened thus. One day, on&#10;General Stepan (my mother&#39;s then employer) happening to catch sight&#10;of me, he exclaimed: &#39;Evgenia, go and tell Fedor&#39; (the ex-soldier&#10;who was then serving the General as footman) &#39;that he is to teach&#10;your son to wait at table! The boy is at least tall enough for the&#10;work.&#39; And for nine years I served the General in this capacity.&#10;And then, and then&#8212;oh, THEN I was seized with an illness&#8230; . Next, I&#10;obtained a post under a merchant who was then mayor of our town,&#10;and stayed with him twenty-one months. And next I obtained a&#10;situation in an hotel at Kharkov, and held it for a year. And after&#10;that I kept changing my places, for, steady and sober though I was,&#10;I was beginning to lack taste for my profession, and to develop a&#10;spirit of the kind which deemed all work to be beneath me, and&#10;considered that I had been created to serve only myself, not&#10;others.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Along the high road to Sukhum which lay behind us there were&#10;proceeding some invisible travellers whose scraping of feet as they&#10;walked proclaimed the fact that they were not over-used to&#10;journeying on foot. Just as the party drew level with us, a musical&#10;voice hummed out softly the line &#34;Alone will I set forth upon the&#10;road,&#34; with the word &#34;alone&#34; plaintively stressed. Next, a resonant&#10;bass voice said with a sort of indolent incisiveness:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Aphon or aphonia means loss of speech to the extent of, to the&#10;extent of&#8212;oh, to WHAT extent, most learned Vera Vasilievna?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;To the extent of total loss of power of articulation,&#34; replied&#10;a voice feminine and youthful of timbre.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Just at that moment we saw two dark, blurred figures, with a&#10;paler figure between them, come gliding into view.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Strange indeed is it that, that&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That what?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That so many names proper to these parts should also be so&#10;suggestive. Take, for instance, Mount Nakopioba. Certainly folk&#10;hereabouts seem to have &#34;amassed&#34; things, and to have known how to&#10;do so.&#34; [The verb nakopit means to amass, to heap up.]&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;For my part, I always fail to remember the name of Simon the&#10;Canaanite. Constantly I find myself calling him &#39;the Cainite.&#39;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Look here,&#34; interrupted the musical voice in a tone of&#10;chastened enthusiasm. &#34;As I contemplate all this beauty, and inhale&#10;this restfulness, I find myself reflecting: &#39;How would it be if I&#10;were to let everything go to the devil, and take up my abode here&#10;for ever?&#39;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At this point all further speech became drowned by the sound of&#10;the monastery&#39;s bell as it struck the hour. The only utterance that&#10;came borne to my ears was the mournful fragment:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p class=&#34;poem&#34;&#62;Oh, if into a single word&#60;br /&#62;&#10;I could pour my inmost thoughts!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;To the foregoing dialogue my companion had listened with his&#10;head tilted to one side, much as though the dialogue had deflected&#10;it in that direction: and now, as the voices died away into the&#10;distance, he sighed, straightened himself, and said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Clearly those people were educated folk. And see too how, as&#10;they talked of one thing and another, there cropped up the old and&#10;ever-persistent point.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;To what point are you referring?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;My companion paused a moment before he replied. Then he&#10;said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Can it be that you did not hear it? Did you not hear one of&#10;those people remark: &#39;I have a mind to surrender everything &#39;?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Whereafter, bending forward, and peering at me as a blind man&#10;would do, Kalinin added in a half-whisper:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;More and more are folk coming to think to themselves: &#39;Now must&#10;I forsake everything.&#39; In the end I myself came to think it. For&#10;many a year did I increasingly reflect: &#39;Why should I be a servant?&#10;What will it ever profit me? Even if I should earn twelve, or&#10;twenty, or fifty roubles a month, to what will such earnings lead,&#10;and where will the man in me come in? Surely it would be better to&#10;do nothing at all, but just to gaze into space (as I am doing now),&#10;and let my eyes stare straight before me?&#39;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;By the way, what were you talking to those people about?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Which people do you mean?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The bearded man and the rest, the company in the&#10;guest-chamber?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ah, THAT man I did not like&#8212;I have no fancy at all for fellows&#10;who strew their grief about the world, and leave it to be trampled&#10;upon by every chance-comer. For how can the tears of my neighbour&#10;benefit me? True, every man has his troubles; but also has every&#10;man such a predilection for his particular woe that he ends by&#10;deeming it the most bitter and remarkable grief in the universe&#8212;you&#10;may take my word for that.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Suddenly the speaker rose to his feet, a tall, lean figure.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Now I must seek my bed,&#34; he remarked. &#34;You see, I shall have to&#10;leave here very early tomorrow.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And for what point?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;For Novorossisk.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now, the day being a Saturday, I had drawn my week&#39;s earnings&#10;from the monastery&#39;s pay-office just before the vigil service.&#10;Also, Novorossisk did not really lie in my direction. Thirdly, I&#10;had no particular wish to exchange the monastery for any other&#10;lodging. Nevertheless, despite all this, the man interested me to&#10;such an extent (of persons who genuinely interest one there never&#10;exist but two, and, of them, oneself is always one) that&#10;straightway I observed:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I too shall be leaving here tomorrow.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Then let us travel together.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At dawn, therefore, we set forth to foot the road in company. At&#10;times I mentally soared aloft, and viewed the scene from that&#10;vantage-point. Whenever I did so, I beheld two tall men traversing&#10;a narrow track by a seashore&#8212;the one clad in a grey military&#10;overcoat and a hat with a broken crown, and the other in a drab&#10;kaftan and a plush cap. At their feet the boundless sea was&#10;splashing white foam, salt-dried ribands of seaweed were strewing&#10;the path, golden leaves were dancing hither and thither, and the&#10;wind was howling at, and buffeting, the travellers as clouds sailed&#10;over their heads. Also, to their right there lay stretched a chain&#10;of mountains towards which the clouds kept wearily, nervelessly&#10;tending, while to their left there lay spread a white-laced expanse&#10;over the surface of which a roaring wind kept ceaselessly driving&#10;transparent columns of spray.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;On such stormy days in autumn everything near a seashore looks&#10;particularly cheerful and vigorous, seeing that, despite the&#10;soughing of wind and wave, and the swift onrush of cloud, and the&#10;fact that the sun is only occasionally to be seen suspended in&#10;abysses of blue, and resembles a drooping flower, one feels that&#10;the apparent chaos has lurking in it a secret harmony of mundane,&#10;but imperishable, forces&#8212;so much so that in time even one&#39;s puny&#10;human heart comes to imbibe the prevalent spirit of revolt, and,&#10;catching fire, to cry to all the universe: &#34;I love you!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Yes, at such times one desires to taste life to the full, and so&#10;to live that the ancient rocks shall smile, and the sea&#39;s white&#10;horses prance the higher, as one&#39;s mouth acclaims the earth in such&#10;a paean that, intoxicated with the laudation, it shall unfold its&#10;riches with added bountifulness and display more and more manifest&#10;beauty under the spur of the love expressed by one of its&#10;creatures, expressed by a human being who feels for the earth what&#10;he would feel for a woman, and yearns to fertilise the same to&#10;ever-increasing splendour.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Nevertheless, words are as heavy as stones, and after felling&#10;fancy to the ground, serve but to heap her grey coffin-lid, and&#10;cause one, as one stands contemplating the tomb, to laugh in sheer&#10;self-derision&#8230; .&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Suddenly, plunged in dreams as I walked along, I heard through&#10;the plash of the waves and the sizzle of the foam the unfamiliar&#10;words:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Hymen, Demon, Igamon, and Zmiulan. Good devils are these, not&#10;bad.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;How does Christ get on with them?&#34; I asked.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Christ? He does not enter into the matter.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Is He hostile to them?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Is He HOSTILE to them? How could He be? Devils of that kind are&#10;devils to themselves-devils of a decent sort. Besides, to no one is&#10;Christ hostile&#34;&#38;#160;&#8230; &#8230; &#8230; &#8230; &#8230; &#8230; &#8230; &#8230; &#8230; &#8230; &#38;#160;&#8230; . .&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;[In the Russian this hiatus occurs as marked.]&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As though unable any longer to brave the assault of the billows,&#10;the path suddenly swerved towards the bushes on our right, and, in&#10;doing so, caused the cloud-wrapped mountains to shift&#10;correspondingly to our immediate front, where the masses of vapour&#10;were darkening as though rain were probable.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Kalinin&#39;s discourse proved instructive as with his stick he from&#10;time to time knocked the track clear of clinging tendrils.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The locality is not without its perils,&#34; once he remarked. &#34;For&#10;hereabouts there lurks malaria. It does so because long ago Maliar&#10;of Kostroma banished his evil sister, Fever, to these parts.&#10;Probably he was paid to do so, but the exact circumstances escape&#10;my memory.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So thickly was the surface of the sea streaked with&#10;cloud-shadows that it bore the appearance of being in mourning, of&#10;being decked in the funeral colours of black and white. Afar off,&#10;Gudaout lay lashed with foam, while constantly objects like&#10;snowdrifts kept gliding towards it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Tell me more about those devils,&#34; I said at length.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well, if you wish. But what exactly am I to tell you about&#10;them?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;All that you may happen to know.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh, I know EVERYTHING about them.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;To this my companion added a wink. Then he continued:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I say that I know everything about those devils for the reason&#10;that for my mother I had a most remarkable woman, a woman cognisant&#10;of each and every species of proverb, anathema, and item of&#10;hagiology. You must know that, after spreading my bed beside the&#10;kitchen stove each night, and her own bed on the top of the stove&#10;(for, after her wet-nursing of three of the General&#39;s children, she&#10;lived a life of absolute ease, and did no work at all)&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Here Kalinin halted, and, driving his stick into the ground,&#10;glanced back along the path before resuming his way with firm,&#10;lengthy strides.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I may tell you that the General had a niece named Valentina&#10;Ignatievna. And she too was a most remarkable woman.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Remarkable for what?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Remarkable for EVERYTHING.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At this moment there came floating over our heads through the&#10;damp-saturated air a cormorant&#8212;one of those voracious birds which&#10;so markedly lack intelligence. And somehow the whistling of its&#10;powerful pinions awoke in me an unpleasant reminiscent thought.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Pray continue,&#34; I said to my fellow traveller.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And each night, as I lay on the floor (I may mention that never&#10;did I climb on to the stove, and to this day I dislike the heat of&#10;one), it was her custom to sit with her legs dangling over the edge&#10;of the top, and tell me stories. And though the room would be too&#10;dark for me to see her face, I could yet see the things of which&#10;she would be speaking. And at times, as these tales came floating&#10;down to me, I would find them so horrible as to be forced to cry&#10;out, &#39;Oh, Mamka, Mamka, DON&#39;T!&#8230; &#39; To this hour I have no love for&#10;the bizarre, and am but a poor hand at remembering it. And as&#10;strange as her stories was my mother. Eventually she died of an&#10;attack of blood-poisoning and, though but forty, had become&#10;grey-headed. Yes, and so terribly did she smell after her death&#10;that everyone in the kitchen was constrained to exclaim at the&#10;odour.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, but what of the devils?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You must wait a minute or two.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Ever as we proceeded, clinging, fantastic branches kept closing&#10;in upon the path, so that we appeared to be walking through a sea&#10;of murmuring verdure. And from time to time a bough would flick us&#10;as though to say: &#34;Speed, speed, or the rain will be upon you!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;If anything, however, my companion slackened his pace as in&#10;measured, sing-song accents he continued:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;When Jesus Christ, God&#39;s Son, went forth into the wilderness to&#10;collect His thoughts, Satan sent devils to subject Him to&#10;temptation. Christ was then young; and as He sat on the burning&#10;sand in the middle of the desert, He pondered upon one thing and&#10;another, and played with a handful of pebbles which He had&#10;collected. Until presently from afar, there descried Him the devils&#10;Hymen, Demon, Igamon, and Zmiulan&#8212;devils of equal age with the&#10;Saviour.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Drawing near unto Him, they said, &#39;Pray suffer us to sport with&#10;Thee.&#39; Whereupon Christ answered with a smile: &#39;Pray be seated.&#39;&#10;Then all of them did sit down in a circle, and proceed to business,&#10;which business was to see whether or not any member of the party&#10;could so throw a stone into the air as to prevent it from falling&#10;back upon the burning sand.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8230; &#8230; &#8230; &#8230; &#8230; &#8230; &#8230; &#8230; &#8230; &#8230; &#38;#160;&#8230; &#38;#160;&#8230; &#38;#160;&#8230; &#38;#160;&#8230; &#38;#160;&#8230; .&#10;.&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#8230; &#38;#160;&#8230; .&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;[In the original Russian this hiatus occurs as given.]&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Christ Himself was the first to throw a stone; whereupon His&#10;stone became changed into a six-winged dove, and fluttered away&#10;towards the Temple of Jerusalem. And, next, the impotent devils&#10;strove to do the same; until at length, when they saw that Christ&#10;could not in any wise be tempted, Zmiulan, the senior of the&#10;devils, cried:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;&#39;Oh Lord, we will tempt Thee no more; for of a surety do we&#10;avail not, and, though we be devils, never shall do so!&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;&#39;Aye, never shall ye!&#39; Christ did agree. &#39;And, therefore, I&#10;will now fulfil that which from the first I did conceive. That ye&#10;be devils I know right well. And that, while yet afar off, ye did,&#10;on beholding me, have compassion upon me I know right well. While&#10;also ye did not in any wise seek to conceal from me the truth as&#10;concerning yourselves. Hence shall ye, for the remainder of your&#10;lives, be GOOD devils; so that at the last shall matters be&#10;rendered easier for you. Do thou, Zmiulan, become King of the&#10;Ocean, and send the winds of the sea to cleanse the land of foul&#10;air. And do thou, Demon, see to it that the cattle shall eat of no&#10;poisonous herb, but that all herbs of the sort be covered with&#10;prickles. Do thou, Igamon, comfort, by night, all comfortless&#10;widows who shall be blaming God for the death of their husbands?&#10;And do thou, Hymen, as the youngest devil of the band, choose for&#10;thyself wherein shall lie thy charge.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;&#39;Oh Lord,&#39; replied Hymen, &#39;I do love but to laugh.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And the Saviour replied:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;&#39;Then cause thou folk to laugh. Only, mark thou, see to it that&#10;they laugh not IN CHURCH.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;&#39;Yet even in church would I laugh, Oh Lord,&#39; the devil&#10;objected.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;&#39;Jesus Christ Himself laughed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;&#39;God go with you!&#39; at length He said. &#39;Then let folk laugh even&#10;in church&#8212;but QUIETLY.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;In such wise did Christ convert those four evil devils into&#10;devils of goodness.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Soaring over the green, bushy sea were a number of old oaks. On&#10;them the yellow leaves were trembling as though chilled; here and&#10;there a sturdy hazel was doffing its withered garments, and&#10;elsewhere a wild cherry was quivering, and elsewhere an almost&#10;naked chestnut was politely rendering obeisance to the earth.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Did you find that story of mine a good one?&#34; my companion&#10;inquired.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I did, for Christ was so good in it.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Always and everywhere He is so,&#34; Kalinin proudly rejoined. &#34;But&#10;do you also know what an old woman of Smolensk used to sing&#10;concerning Him?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I do not.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Halting, my strange traveller chanted in a feignedly senile and&#10;tremulous voice, as he beat time with his foot:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p class=&#34;poem&#34;&#62;In the heavens a flow&#39;r doth blow,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;It is the Son of God.&#60;br /&#62;&#10;From it all our joys do flow,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;It is the Son of God.&#60;br /&#62;&#10;In the sun&#39;s red rays He dwells&#60;br /&#62;&#10;He, the Son of God.&#60;br /&#62;&#10;His light our every ill dispels.&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Praised be the Son of God!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Each successive line seemed to inspire Kalinin&#39;s voice with&#10;added youthfulness, until, indeed, the concluding words&#8212;&#34;The One&#10;and Only God&#34;&#8212;issued in a high, agreeable tenor.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Suddenly a flash of lightning blazed before us, while dull&#10;thunder crashed among the mountains, and sent its hundred-voiced&#10;echoes rolling over land and sea. In his consternation, Kalinin&#10;opened his mouth until a set of fine, even teeth became bared to&#10;view. Then, with repeated crossings of himself, he muttered.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh dread God, Oh beneficent God, Oh God who sittest on high,&#10;and on a golden throne, and under a gilded canopy, do Thou now&#10;punish Satan, lest he overwhelm me in the midst of my sins!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Whereafter, turning a small and terrified face in my direction,&#10;and blinking his bright eyes, he added with hurried diction:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Come, brother! Come! Let us run on ahead, for thunderstorms are&#10;my bane. Yes, let us run with all possible speed, run ANYWHERE, for&#10;soon the rain will be pouring down, and these parts are full of&#10;lurking fever.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Off, therefore, we started, with the wind smiting us behind, and&#10;our kettles and teapots jangling, and my wallet, in particular,&#10;thumping me about the middle of the body as though it had been&#10;wielding a large, soft fist. Yet a far cry would it be to the&#10;mountains, nor was any dwelling in sight, while ever and anon&#10;branches caught at our clothes, and stones leapt aloft under our&#10;tread, and the air grew steadily darker, and the mountains seemed&#10;to begin gliding towards us.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Once more from the black cloud-masses, heaven belched a fiery&#10;dart which caused the sea to scintillate with blue sapphires in&#10;response, and, seemingly, to recoil from the shore as the earth&#10;shook, and the mountain defiles emitted a gigantic scrunching sound&#10;of their rock-hewn jaws.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh Holy One! Oh Holy One! Oh Holy One!&#34; screamed Kalinin as he&#10;dived into the bushes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In the rear, the waves lashed us as though they had a mind to&#10;arrest our progress; from the gloom to our front came a sort of&#10;scraping and rasping; long black hands seemed to wave over our&#10;heads; just at the point where the mountain crests lay swathed in&#10;their dense coverlet of cloud, there rumbled once more the&#10;deafening iron chariot of the thunder-god; more and more frequently&#10;flashed the lightning as the earth rang, and rifts cleft by the&#10;blue glare disclosed, amid the obscurity, great trees that were&#10;rustling and rocking and, to all appearances, racing headlong&#10;before the scourge of a cold, slanting rain.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The occasion was a harassing but bracing one, for as the fine&#10;bands of rain beat upon our faces, our bodies felt filled with a&#10;heady vigour of a kind to fit us to run indefinitely&#8212;at all events&#10;to run until this storm of rain and thunder should be outpaced, and&#10;clear weather be reached again.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Suddenly Kalinin shouted: &#34;Stop! Look!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;This was because the fitful illumination of a flash had just&#10;shown up in front of us the trunk of an oak tree which had a large&#10;black hollow let into it like a doorway. So into that hollow we&#10;crawled as two mice might have done&#8212;laughing aloud in our glee as&#10;we did so.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Here there is room for THREE persons,&#34; my companion remarked.&#10;&#34;Evidently it is a hollow that has been burnt out&#8212;though rascals&#10;indeed must the burners have been to kindle a fire in a living&#10;tree!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;However, the space within the hollow was both confined and&#10;redolent of smoke and dead leaves. Also, heavy drops of rain still&#10;bespattered our heads and shoulders, and at every peal of thunder&#10;the tree quivered and creaked until the strident din around us gave&#10;one the illusion of being afloat in a narrow caique. Meanwhile at&#10;every flash of the lightning&#39;s glare, we could see slanting ribands&#10;of rain cutting the air with a network of blue, glistening,&#10;vitreous lines.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Presently, the wind began to whistle less loudly, as though now&#10;it felt satisfied at having driven so much productive rain into the&#10;ground, and washed clean the mountain tops, and loosened the stony&#10;soil.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;U-oh! U-oh!&#34; hooted a grey mountain owl just over our&#10;heads.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why, surely it believes the time to be night!&#34; Kalinin&#10;commented in a whisper.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;U-oh! U-u-u-oh!&#34; hooted the bird again, and in response my&#10;companion shouted:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You have made a mistake, my brother!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;By this time the air was feeling chilly, and a bright grey fog&#10;had streamed over us, and wrapped a semi-transparent veil about the&#10;gnarled, barrel-like trunks with their outgrowing shoots and the&#10;few remaining leaves still adhering.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Far and wide the monotonous din continued to rage&#8212;it did so&#10;until conscious thought began almost to be impossible. Yet even as&#10;one strained one&#39;s attention, and listened to the rain lashing the&#10;fallen leaves, and pounding the stones, and bespattering the trunks&#10;of the trees, and to the murmuring and splashing of rivulets racing&#10;towards the sea, and to the roaring of torrents as they thundered&#10;over the rocks of the mountains, and to the creaking of trees&#10;before the wind, and to the measured thud-thud of the waves; as one&#10;listened to all this, the thousand sounds seemed to combine into a&#10;single heaviness of hurried clamour, and involuntarily one found&#10;oneself striving to disunite them, and to space them even as one&#10;spaces the words of a song.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Kalinin fidgeted, nudged me, and muttered:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I find this place too close for me. Always I have hated&#10;confinement.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Nevertheless he had taken far more care than I to make himself&#10;comfortable, for he had edged himself right into the hollow, and,&#10;by squatting on his haunches, reduced his frame to the form of a&#10;ball. Moreover, the rain-drippings scarcely or in no wise touched&#10;him, while, in general, he appeared to have developed to the full&#10;an aptitude for vagrancy as a permanent condition, and for the&#10;allowing of no unpleasant circumstance to debar him from invariably&#10;finding the most convenient vantage-ground at a given juncture.&#10;Presently, in fact, he continued:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes; despite the rain and cold and everything else, I consider&#10;life to be not quite intolerable.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Not quite intolerable in what?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Not quite intolerable in the fact that at least I am bound to&#10;the service of no one save God. For if disagreeablenesses have to&#10;be endured, at all events they come better from Him than from one&#39;s&#10;own species.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Then you have no great love for your own species?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;One loves one&#39;s neighbour as the dog loves the stick.&#34; To&#10;which, after a pause, the speaker added:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;For WHY should I love him?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It puzzled me to cite a reason off-hand, but, fortunately,&#10;Kalinin did not wait for an answer&#8212;rather, he went on to ask:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Have you ever been a footman?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No,&#34; I replied.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Then let me tell you that it is peculiarly difficult for a&#10;footman to love his neighbour.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Wherefore?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Go and be a footman; THEN you will know. In fact, it is never&#10;the case that, if one serves a man, one can love that man&#8230; . How&#10;steadily the rain persists!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Indeed, on every hand there was in progress a trickling and a&#10;splashing sound as though the weeping earth were venting soft,&#10;sorrowful sobs over the departure of summer before winter and its&#10;storms should arrive.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;How come you to be travelling the Caucasus?&#34; I asked at&#10;length.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Merely through the fact that my walking and walking has brought&#10;me hither,&#34; was the reply. &#34;For that matter, everyone ends by&#10;heading for the Caucasus.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why so?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why NOT, seeing that from one&#39;s earliest years one hears of&#10;nothing but the Caucasus, the Caucasus? Why, even our old General&#10;used to harp upon the name, with his moustache bristling, and his&#10;eyes protruding, as he did so. And the same as regards my mother,&#10;who had visited the country in the days when, as yet, the General&#10;was in command but of a company. Yes, everyone tends hither. And&#10;another reason is the fact that the country is an easy one to live&#10;in, a country which enjoys much sunshine, and produces much food,&#10;and has a winter less long and severe than our own winter, and&#10;therefore presents pleasanter conditions of life.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And what of the country&#39;s people?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What of the country&#39;s people? Oh, so long as you keep yourself&#10;to yourself they will not interfere with you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And why will they not?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Kalinin paused, stared at me, smiled condescendingly, and,&#10;finally, said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What a dullard you are to ask about such simple things! Were&#10;you never given any sort of an education? Surely by this time you&#10;ought to be able to understand something?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then, with a change of subject, and subduing his tone to one of&#10;snuffling supplication, he added in the sing-song chant of a person&#10;reciting a prayer:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;&#39;Oh Lord, suffer me not to become bound unto the clergy the&#10;priesthood, the diaconate, the tchinovstvo, [The official class] or&#10;the intelligentsia!&#39; This was a petition which my mother used often&#10;to repeat.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The raindrops now were falling more gently, and in finer lines&#10;and more transparent network, so that one could once more descry&#10;the great trunks of the blackened oaks, with the green and gold of&#10;their leaves. Also, our own hollow had grown less dark, and there&#10;could be discerned its smoky, satin-bright walls. From those walls&#10;Kalinin picked a bit of charcoal with finger and thumb, saying:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It was shepherds that fired the place. See where they dragged&#10;in hay and dead leaves! A shepherd&#39;s fife hereabouts must be a&#10;truly glorious one!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Lastly, clasping his head as though he were about to fall&#10;asleep, he sank his chin between his knees, and relapsed into&#10;silence.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Presently a brilliant, sinuous little rivulet which had long&#10;been laving the bare roots of our tree brought floating past us a&#10;red and fawn leaf.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;How pretty,&#34; I thought, &#34;that leaf will look from a distance&#10;when reposing on the surface of the sea! For, like the sun when he&#10;is in solitary possession of the heavens, that leaf will stand out&#10;against the blue, silky expanse like a lonely red star.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;After awhile my companion began, catlike, to purr to himself a&#10;song. Its melody, the melody of &#34;the moon withdrew behind a cloud,&#34;&#10;was familiar enough, but not so the words, which ran:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p class=&#34;poem&#34;&#62;Oh Valentina, wondrous maid,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;More comely thou than e&#39;er a flow&#39;r!&#60;br /&#62;&#10;The nurse&#39;s son doth pine for thee,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;And yearn to serve thee every hour!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What does that ditty mean?&#34; I inquired.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Kalinin straightened himself, gave a wriggle to a form that was&#10;as lithe as a lizard&#39;s, and passed one hand over his face.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It is a certain composition,&#34; he replied presently. &#34;It is a&#10;composition that was composed by a military clerk who afterwards&#10;died of consumption. He was my friend his life long, and my only&#10;friend, and a true one, besides being a man out of the common.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And who was Valentina?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My one-time mistress,&#34; Kalinin spoke unwillingly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And he, the clerk&#8212;was he in love with her?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh dear no!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Evidently Kalinin had no particular wish to discuss the subject,&#10;for he hugged himself together, buried his face in his hands, and&#10;muttered:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I should like to kindle a fire, were it not that everything in&#10;the place is too damp for the purpose.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The wind shook the trees, and whistled despondently, while the&#10;fine, persistent rain still whipped the earth.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I but humble am, and poor, Nor fated to be otherwise,&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;sang Kalinin softly as, flinging up his head with an unexpected&#10;movement, he added meaningly:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, it is a mournful song, a song which could move to tears.&#10;Only to two persons has it ever been known; to my friend the clerk&#10;and to myself. Yes, and to HER, though I need hardly add that at&#10;once she forgot it.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And Kalinin&#39;s eyes flashed into a smile as he added:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I think that, as a young man, you had better learn forthwith&#10;where the greatest danger lurks in life. Let me tell you a&#10;story.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And upon that a very human tale filtered through the silken&#10;monotonous swish of the downpour, with, for listeners to it, only&#10;the rain and myself.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Lukianov was NEVER in love with her,&#34; he narrated. &#34;Only I was&#10;that. All that Lukianov did in the matter was to write, at my&#10;request, some verses. When she first appeared on the scene (I mean&#10;Valentina Ignatievna) I was just turned nineteen years of age; and&#10;the instant that my eyes fell upon her form I realised that in her&#10;alone lay my fate, and my heart almost stopped beating, and my&#10;vitality stretched out towards her as a speck of dust flies towards&#10;a fire. Yet all this I had to conceal as best I might; with the&#10;result that in the company&#39;s presence I felt like a sentry doing&#10;guard duty in the presence of his commanding officer. But at last,&#10;though I strove to pull myself together, to steady myself against&#10;the ferment that was raging in my breast, something happened.&#10;Valentina Ignatievna was then aged about twenty-five, and very&#10;beautiful&#8212;marvellous, in fact! Also, she was an orphan, since her&#10;father had been killed by the Chechentzes, and her mother had died&#10;of smallpox at Samarkand. As regards her kinship with the General,&#10;she stood to him in the relation of niece by marriage.&#10;Golden-locked, and as skin-fair as enamelled porcelain, she had&#10;eyes like emeralds, and a figure wholly symmetrical, though as slim&#10;as a wafer. For bedroom she had a little corner apartment situated&#10;next to the kitchen (the General possessed his own house, of&#10;course), while, in addition, they allotted her a bright little&#10;boudoir in which she disposed her curios and knickknacks, from&#10;cut-glass bottles and goblets to a copper pipe and a glass ring&#10;mounted on copper. This ring, when turned, used to emit showers of&#10;glittering sparks, though she was in no way afraid of them, but&#10;would sing as she made them dance:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p class=&#34;poem&#34;&#62;&#34;Not for me the spring will dawn!&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Not for me the Bug will spate!&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Not for me love&#39;s smile will wait!&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Not for me, ah, not for me!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Constantly would she warble this.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Also, once she flashed an appeal at me with her eyes, and&#10;said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;&#39;Alexei, please never touch anything in my room, for my things&#10;are too fragile.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Sure enough, in HER presence ANYTHING might have fallen from my&#10;hands!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Meanwhile her song about &#39;Not for me&#39; used to make me feel&#10;sorry for her. &#39;Not for you?&#39; I used to say to myself. &#39;Ought not&#10;EVERYTHING to be for you?&#39; And this reflection would cause my heart&#10;to yearn and stretch towards her. Next, I bought a guitar, an&#10;instrument which I could not play, and took it for instruction to&#10;Lukianov, the clerk of the Divisional Staff, which had its&#10;headquarters in our street. In passing I may say that Lukianov was&#10;a little Jewish convert with dark hair, sallow features, and&#10;gimlet-sharp eyes, but beyond all things a fellow with brains, and&#10;one who could play the guitar unforgettably.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Once he said: &#39;In life all things are attainable&#8212;nothing need&#10;we lose for want of trying. For whence does everything come? From&#10;the plainest of mankind. A man may not be BORN in the rank of a&#10;general, but at least he may attain to that position. Also, the&#10;beginning and ending of all things is woman. All that she requires&#10;for her captivation is poetry. Hence, let me write you some verses,&#10;that you may tender them to her as an offering.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;These, mind you, were the words of a man in whom the heart was&#10;absolutely single, absolutely dispassionate.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Until then Kalinin had told his story swiftly, with animation;&#10;but thereafter he seemed, as it were, to become extinguished. After&#10;a pause of a few seconds he continued&#8212;continued in slower, to all&#10;appearances more unwilling, accents&#8212;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;At the time I believed what Lukianov said, but subsequently I&#10;came to see that things were not altogether as he had&#10;represented&#8212;that woman is merely a delusion, and poetry merely&#10;fiddle-faddle; and that a man cannot escape his fate, and that,&#10;though good in war, boldness is, in peace affairs, but naked&#10;effrontery. In this, brother, lies the chief, the fundamental law&#10;of life. For the world contains certain people of high station, and&#10;certain people of low; and so long as these two categories retain&#10;their respective positions, all goes well; but as soon as ever a&#10;man seeks to pass from the upper category to the inferior category,&#10;or from the inferior to the upper, the fat falls into the fire, and&#10;that man finds himself stuck midway, stuck neither here nor there,&#10;and bound to abide there for the remainder of his life, for the&#10;remainder of his life&#8230; . Always keep to your own position, to the&#10;position assigned you by fate&#8230; .. Will the rain NEVER cease, think&#10;you?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;By this time, as a matter of fact, the raindrops were falling&#10;less heavily and densely than hitherto, and the wet clouds were&#10;beginning to reveal bright patches in the moisture-soaked&#10;firmament, as evidence that the sun was still in existence.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Continue,&#34; I said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Kalinin laughed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Then you find the story an interesting one,&#34; he remarked.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Presently he resumed:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;As I have said, I trusted Lukianov implicitly, and begged of&#10;him to write the verses. And write them he did&#8212;he wrote them the&#10;very next day. True, at this distance of time I have forgotten the&#10;words in their entirety, but at least I remember that there&#10;occurred in them a phrase to the effect that &#39;for days and weeks&#10;have your eyes been consuming my heart in the fire of love, so pity&#10;me, I pray.&#39; I then proceeded to copy out the poem, and tremblingly&#10;to leave it on her table.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The next morning, when I was tidying her boudoir, she made an&#10;unexpected entry, and, clad in a loose, red dressing-gown, and&#10;holding a cigarette between her lips, said to me with a kindly&#10;smile as she produced my precious paper of verses:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;&#39;Alexei, did YOU write these?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;&#39;Yes,&#39; was my reply. &#39;And for Christ&#39;s sake pardon me for the&#10;same.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;&#39;What a pity that such a fancy should have entered your head!&#10;For, you see, I am engaged already&#8212;my uncle is intending to marry&#10;me to Doctor Kliachka, and I am powerless in the matter.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The very fact that she could address me with so much sympathy&#10;and kindness struck me dumb. As regards Doctor Kliachka, I may&#10;mention that he was a good-looking, blotchy-faced, heavy-jowled&#10;fellow with a moustache that reached to his shoulders, and lips&#10;that were for ever laughing and vociferating. &#39;Nothing has either a&#10;beginning or an end. The only thing really existent is&#10;pleasure.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Nay, even the General could, at times, make sport of the&#10;fellow, and say as he shook with merriment:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;&#39;A doctor-comedian is the sort of man that you are.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Now, at the period of which I am speaking I was as straight as&#10;a dart, and had a shock of luxuriant hair over a set of ruddy&#10;features. Also, I was living a life clean in every way, and&#10;maintaining a cautious attitude towards womenfolk, and holding&#10;prostitutes in a contempt born of the fact that I had higher views&#10;with regard to my life&#39;s destiny. Lastly, I never indulged in&#10;liquor, for I actually disliked it, and gave way to its influence&#10;only in days subsequent to the episode which I am narrating. Yes,&#10;and, last of all, I was in the habit of taking a bath every&#10;Saturday.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The same evening Kliachka and the rest of the party went out to&#10;the theatre (for, naturally, the General had horses and a carriage&#10;of his own), and I, for my part, went to inform Lukianov of what&#10;had happened.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;He said: &#39;I must congratulate you, and am ready to wager you&#10;two bottles of beer that your affair is as good as settled. In a&#10;few seconds a fresh lot of verses shall be turned out, for poetry&#10;constitutes a species of talisman or charm.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And, sure enough, he then and there composed the piece about&#10;&#39;the wondrous Valentina.&#39; What a tender thing it is, and how full&#10;of understanding! My God, my God!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And, with a thoughtful shake of his bead, Kalinin raised his&#10;boyish eyes towards the blue patches in the rain-washed sky.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Duly she found the verses,&#34; he continued after a while, and&#10;with a vehemence that seemed wholly independent of his will. &#34;And&#10;thereupon she summoned me to her room.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;&#39;What are we to do about it all?&#39; she inquired.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;She was but half-dressed, and practically the whole of her&#10;bosom was visible to my sight. Also, her naked feet had on them&#10;only slippers, and as she sat in her chair she kept rocking one&#10;foot to and fro in a maddening way.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;&#39;What are we to do about it all?&#39; she repeated.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;&#39;What am I to say about it, at length I replied, &#39;save that I&#10;feel as though I were not really existing on earth?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;&#39;Are you one who can hold your tongue?&#39; was her next&#10;question.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I nodded&#8212;nothing else could I compass, for further speech had&#10;become impossible. Whereupon, rising with brows puckered, she&#10;fetched a couple of small phials, and, with the aid of ingredients&#10;thence, mixed a powder which she wrapped in paper, and handed me&#10;with the words:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;&#39;Only one way of escape offers from the Plagues of Egypt. Here&#10;I have a certain powder. Tonight the doctor is to dine with us.&#10;Place the powder in his soup, and within a few days I shall be&#10;free!&#8212;yes, free for you!&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I crossed myself, and duly took from her the paper, whilst a&#10;mist rose, and swam before my eyes, as I did so, and my legs became&#10;perfectly numb. What I next did I hardly know, for inwardly I was&#10;swooning. Indeed, until Kliachka&#39;s arrival the same evening I&#10;remained practically in a state of coma.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Here Kalinin shuddered&#8212;then glanced at me with drawn features&#10;and chattering teeth, and stirred uneasily.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Suppose we light a fire?&#34; he ventured. &#34;I am growing shivery&#10;all over. But first we must move outside.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The torn clouds were casting their shadows wearily athwart the&#10;sodden earth and glittering stones and silver-dusted herbage. Only&#10;on a single mountain top had a blur of mist settled like an&#10;arrested avalanche, and was resting there with its edges steaming.&#10;The sea too had grown calmer under the rain, and was splashing with&#10;more gentle mournfulness, even as the blue patches in the firmament&#10;had taken on a softer, warmer look, and stray sunbeams were&#10;touching upon land and sea in turn, and, where they chanced to fall&#10;upon herbage, causing pearls and emeralds to sparkle on every leaf,&#10;and kaleidoscopic tints to glow where the dark-blue sea reflected&#10;their generous radiance. Indeed, so goodly, so full of promise, was&#10;the scene that one might have supposed autumn to have fled away for&#10;ever before the wind and the rain, and beneficent summer to have&#10;been restored.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Presently through the moist, squelching sound of our footsteps,&#10;and the cheerful patter of the rain-drippings, Kalinin&#39;s narrative&#10;resumed its languid, querulous course:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;When, that evening, I opened the door to the doctor I could not&#10;bring myself to look him in the face&#8212;I could merely hang my head;&#10;whereupon, taking me by the chin, and raising it, he inquired:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why is your face so yellow? What is the matter with you?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, a kind-hearted man was he, and one who had never failed to&#10;tip me well, and to speak to me with as much consideration as&#10;though I had not been a footman at all.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;&#39;I am not in very good health,&#39; I replied. &#39;I, I&#8212;&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;&#39;Come, come!&#39; was his interjection. &#39;After dinner I must look&#10;you over, and in the meanwhile, do keep up your spirits.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Then I realised that poison him I could not, but that the&#10;powder must be swallowed by myself&#8212;yes, by myself! Aye, over my&#10;heart a flash of lightning had gleamed, and shown me that now I was&#10;no longer following the road properly assigned me by fate.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Rushing away to my room, I poured out a glass of water, and&#10;emptied into it the powder; whereupon the water thickened, fizzed,&#10;and became topped with foam. Oh, a terrible moment it was!&#8230; Then I&#10;drank the mixture. Yet no burning sensation ensued, and though I&#10;listened to my vitals, nothing was to be heard in that quarter,&#10;but, on the contrary, my head began to lighten, and I found myself&#10;losing the sense of self-pity which had brought me almost to the&#10;point of tears&#8230; . Shall we settle ourselves here?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Before us a large stone, capped with green moss and climbing&#10;plants, was good-humouredly thrusting upwards a broad, flat face&#10;beneath which the body had, like that of the hero Sviatogov, sunken&#10;into the earth through its own weight until only the face, a visage&#10;worn with aeons of meditation, was now visible. On every side,&#10;also, had oak-trees overgrown and encompassed the bulk of the&#10;projection, as though they too had been made of stone, with their&#10;branches drooping sufficiently low to brush the wrinkles of the&#10;ancient monolith. Kalinin seated himself on his haunches under the&#10;overhanging rim of the stone, and said as he snapped some twigs in&#10;half:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;This is where we ought to have been sitting whilst the rain was&#10;coming down.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And so say I,&#34; I rejoined. &#34;But pray continue your story.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, when you have put a match to the fire.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Whereafter, further withdrawing his spare frame under the stone,&#10;so that he might stretch himself at full length, Kalinin&#10;continued:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I walked to the pantry quietly enough, though my legs were&#10;tottering beneath me, and I had a cold sensation in my breast.&#10;Suddenly I heard the dining-room echo to a merry peal of laughter&#10;from Valentina Ignatievna, and the General reply to that&#10;outburst:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;&#39;Ah, that man! Ah, these servants of ours! Why, the fellow&#10;would do ANYTHING for a piatak &#39;[A silver five-kopeck piece, equal&#10;in value to 2 1/4 pence.]&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;To this my beloved one retorted:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;&#39;Oh, uncle, uncle! Is it only a piatak that I am worth?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And then I heard the doctor put in:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;&#39;What was it you gave him?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;&#39;Merely some soda and tartaric acid. To think of the fun that&#10;we shall have!&#39;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Here, closing his eyes, Kalinin remained silent for a moment,&#10;whilst the moist breeze sighed as it drove dense, wet mist against&#10;the black branches of the trees.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;At first my feeling was one of overwhelming joy at the thought&#10;that at least not DEATH was to be my fate. For I may tell you that,&#10;so far from being harmful, soda and tartaric acid are frequently&#10;taken as a remedy against drunken headache. Then the thought&#10;occurred to me: &#39;But, since I am not a tippler, why should such a&#10;joke have been played upon ME?&#39; However, from that moment I began&#10;to feel easier, and when the company had sat down to dinner, and,&#10;amid a general silence, I was handing round the soup, the doctor&#10;tasted his portion, and, raising his head with a frown,&#10;inquired:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;&#39;Forgive me, but what soup is this?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;&#39;Ah!&#39; I inwardly reflected. &#39;Soon, good gentlefolk, you will&#10;see how your jest has miscarried.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Aloud I replied&#8212;replied with complete boldness:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;&#39;Do not fear, sir. I have taken the powder myself.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Upon this the General and his wife, who were still in ignorance&#10;that the jest had gone amiss, began to titter, but the others said&#10;nothing, though Valentina Ignatievna&#39;s eyes grew rounder and&#10;rounder, until in an undertone she murmured:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;&#39;Did you KNOW that the stuff was harmless?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;&#39;I did not,&#39; I replied. &#39;At least, not at the moment of my&#10;drinking it.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Whereafter falling headlong to the floor, I lost&#10;consciousness.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Kalinin&#39;s small face had become painfully contracted, and grown&#10;old and haggard-looking. Rolling over on to his breast before the&#10;languishing fire, he waved a hand to dissipate the smoke which was&#10;lazily drifting slant-wise.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;For seventeen days did I remain stretched on a sick-bed, and&#10;was attended by the doctor in person. One day, when sitting by my&#10;side, he inquired:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;&#39;I presume your intention was to poison yourself, you foolish&#10;fellow?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, merely THAT was what he called me&#8212;a &#39;foolish fellow.&#39; Yet&#10;indeed, what was I to him? Only an entity which might become food&#10;for dogs, for all he cared. Nor did Valentina Ignatievna herself&#10;pay me a single visit, and my eyes never again beheld her. Before&#10;long she and Dr. Kliachka were duly married, and departed to&#10;Kharkov, where he was assigned a post in the Tchuguerski Camp. Thus&#10;only the General remained. Rough and ready, he was, nevertheless,&#10;old and sensible, and for that reason, did not matter; wherefore I&#10;retained my situation as before. On my recovery, he sent for me,&#10;and said in a tone of reproof:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;&#39;Look here. You are not wholly an idiot. What has happened is&#10;that those vile books of yours have corrupted your mind&#39; (as a&#10;matter of fact, I had never read a book in my life, since for&#10;reading I have no love or inclination). &#39;Hence you must have seen&#10;for yourself that only in tales do clowns marry princesses. You&#10;know, life is like a game of chess. Every piece has its proper move&#10;on the board, or the game could not be played at all.&#39;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Kalinin rubbed his hands over the fire (slender, non-workmanlike&#10;hands they were), and winked and smiled.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I took the General&#39;s words very seriously, and proceeded to ask&#10;myself: &#39;To what do those words amount? To this: that though I may&#10;not care actually to take part in the game, I need not waste my&#10;whole existence through a disinclination to learn the best use to&#10;which that existence can be put.&#39;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With a triumphant uplift of tone, Kalinin continued:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;So, brother, I set myself to WATCH the game in question; with&#10;the result that soon I discovered that the majority of men live&#10;surrounded with a host of superfluous commodities which do but&#10;burden them, and have in themselves no real value. What I refer to&#10;is books, pictures, china, and rubbish of the same sort. Thought I&#10;to myself: &#39;Why should I devote my life to tending and dusting such&#10;commodities while risking, all the time, their breakage? No more of&#10;it for me! Was it for the tending of such articles that my mother&#10;bore me amid the agonies of childbirth? Is it an existence of THIS&#10;kind that must be passed until the tomb be reached? No, no&#8212;a&#10;thousand times no! Rather will I, with your good leave, reject&#10;altogether the game of life, and subsist as may be best for me, and&#10;as may happen to be my pleasure.&#39;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now, as Kalinin spoke, his eyes emitted green sparks, and as he&#10;waved his hands over the fire, as though to lop off the red tongues&#10;of flame, his fingers twisted convulsively.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Of course, not all at a stroke did I arrive at this conclusion;&#10;I did so but gradually. The person who finally confirmed me in my&#10;opinion was a friar of Baku, a sage of pre-eminent wisdom, through&#10;his saying to me: &#39;With nothing at all ought a man to fetter his&#10;soul. Neither with bond-service, nor with property, nor with&#10;womankind, nor with any other concession to the temptations of this&#10;world ought he to constrain its action. Rather ought he to live&#10;alone, and to love none but Christ. Only this is true. Only this&#10;will be for ever lasting.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And,&#34; added Kalinin with animation and inflated cheeks and&#10;flushed, suppressed enthusiasm, &#34;many lands and many peoples have I&#10;seen, and always have I found (particularly in Russia) that many&#10;folk already have reached an understanding of themselves, and,&#10;consequently, refused any longer to render obeisance to&#10;absurdities. &#39;Shun evil, and you will evolve good.&#39; That is what&#10;the friar said to me as a parting word&#8212;though long before our&#10;encounter had I grasped the meaning of the axiom. And that axiom I&#10;myself have since passed on to other folk, as I hope to do yet many&#10;times in the future.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At this point the speaker&#39;s tone reverted to one of querulous&#10;anxiety.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Look how low the sun has sunk!&#34; he exclaimed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;True enough, that luminary, large and round, was declining&#10;into&#8212;rather, towards&#8212;the sea, while suspended between him and the&#10;water were low, dark, white-topped cumuli.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Soon nightfall will be overtaking us,&#34; continued Kalinin as he&#10;fumbled in his kaftan. &#34;And in these parts jackals howl when&#10;darkness is come.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In particular did I notice three clouds that looked like Turks&#10;in white turbans and robes of a dusky red colour. And as these&#10;cloud Turks bent their heads together in private converse, suddenly&#10;there swelled up on the back of one of the figures a hump, while on&#10;the turban of a second there sprouted forth a pale pink feather&#10;which, becoming detached from its base, went floating upwards&#10;towards the zenith and the now rayless, despondent, moonlike sun.&#10;Lastly the third Turk stooped forward over the sea to screen his&#10;companions, and as he did so, developed a huge red nose which&#10;comically seemed to dip towards, and sniff at, the waters.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Sometimes,&#34; continued Kalinin&#39;s even voice through the&#10;crackling and hissing of the wood fire, &#34;a man who is old and blind&#10;may cobble a shoe better than cleverer men than he, can order their&#10;whole lives.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But no longer did I desire to listen to Kalinin, for the threads&#10;which had drawn me, bound me, to his personality had now parted.&#10;All that I desired to do was to contemplate in silence the sea,&#10;while thinking of some of those subjects which at eventide never&#10;fail to stir the soul to gentle, kindly emotion. Bombers, Kalinin&#39;s&#10;words continued dripping into my ear like belated raindrops.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Nowadays everybody is a busybody. Nowadays everyone inquires of&#10;his fellow-man, &#39;How is your life ordered?&#39; To which always there&#10;is added didactically, &#39;But you ought not to live as you are doing.&#10;Let me show you the way.&#39; As though anyone can tell me how best my&#10;life may attain full development, seeing that no one can possibly&#10;have such a matter within his knowledge! Nay, let every man live as&#10;best he pleases, without compulsion. For instance, I have no need&#10;of you. In return, it is not your business either to require or to&#10;expect aught of me. And this I say though Father Vitali says the&#10;contrary, and avers that throughout should man war with the evils&#10;of the world.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In the vague, wide firmament a blood-red cluster of clouds was&#10;hanging, and as I contemplated it there occurred to me the thought,&#10;&#34;May not those clouds be erstwhile righteous world-folk who are&#10;following an unseen path across that expanse, and dyeing it red&#10;with their good blood as they go, in order that the earth may be&#10;fertilised?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;To right and left of that strip of living flame the sea was of a&#10;curious wine tint, while further off, rather, it was as soft and&#10;black as velvet, and in the remote east sheet-lightning was&#10;flashing even as though some giant hand were fruitlessly&#10;endeavouring to strike a match against the sodden firmament.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Meanwhile Kalinin continued to discourse with enthusiasm on the&#10;subject of Father Vitali, the Labour Superintendent of the&#10;monastery of New Athos, while describing in detail the monk&#39;s&#10;jovial, clever features with their pearly teeth and contrasting&#10;black and silver beard. In particular he related how once Vitali&#10;had knitted his fine, almost womanlike eyes, and said in a bass&#10;which stressed its &#34;o&#39;s&#34;:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;On our first arrival here, we found in possession only&#10;prehistoric chaos and demoniacal influence. Everywhere had clinging&#10;weeds grown to rankness; everywhere one found one&#39;s feet entangled&#10;among bindweed and other vegetation of the sort. And now see what&#10;beauty and joy and comfort the hand of man has wrought!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And, having thus spoken, the monk had traced a great circle with&#10;his eye and doughty hand, a circle which had embraced as in a frame&#10;the mount, and the gardens fashioned and developed by ridgings of&#10;the rock, and the downy soil which had been beaten into those&#10;ridgings, and the silver streak of waterfall playing almost at&#10;Vitali&#39;s feet, and the stone-hewn staircase leading to the cave of&#10;Simeon the Canaanite, and the gilded cupolas of the new church&#10;where they had stood flashing in the noontide sun, and the&#10;snow-white, shimmering blocks of the guesthouse and the servants&#39;&#10;quarters, and the glittering fishponds, and the trees of uniform&#10;trimness, yet a uniformly regal dignity.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Brethren,&#34; the monk had said in triumphant conclusion,&#10;&#34;wheresoever man may be, he will, as he so desires, be given power&#10;to overcome the desolation of the wilds.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And then I pressed him further,&#34; Kalinin added. &#34;Yes, I said to&#10;him: &#39;Nevertheless Christ, our Lord, was not like you, for He was&#10;homeless and a wanderer. He was one who utterly rejected your life&#10;of intensive cultivation of the soil&#39;&#34; (as he related the incident&#10;Kalinin gave his head sundry jerks from side to side which made his&#10;ears flap, to and fro). &#34;&#39;Also neither for the lowly alone nor for&#10;the exalted alone did Christ exist. Rather, He, like all great&#10;benefactors, was one who had no particular leaning. Nay, even when&#10;He was roaming the Russian Land in company with Saints Yuri and&#10;Nikolai, He always forbore to intrude Himself into the villages&#39;&#10;affairs, just as, whenever His companions engaged in disputes&#10;concerning mankind, He never failed to maintain silence on the&#10;subject.&#39; Yes, thus I plagued Vitali until he shouted at my head,&#10;&#39;Ah, impudence, you are a heretic!&#39;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;By this time, the air under the lee of the stone was growing&#10;smoky and oppressive, for the fire, with its flames looking like a&#10;bouquet compounded of red poppies or azaleas and blooms of an&#10;aureate tint, had begun fairly to live its beautiful existence, and&#10;was blazing, and diffusing warmth, and laughing its bright,&#10;cheerful, intelligent laugh. Yet from the mountains and the&#10;cloud-masses evening was descending, as the earth emitted profound&#10;gasps of humidity, and the sea intoned its vague, thoughtful,&#10;resonant song.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I presume we are going to pass the night here?&#34; Kalinin at&#10;length queried.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No, for my intention is, rather, to continue my journey.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Then let us make an immediate start.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But my direction will not be the same as yours, I think?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Previously to this, Kalinin had squatted down upon his haunches,&#10;and taken some bread and a few pears from his wallet; but now, on&#10;hearing my decision, he replaced the viands in his receptacle,&#10;snapped&#8212;to the lid of it with an air of vexation&#8212;and asked:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why did you come with me at all?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Because I wanted to have a talk with you&#8212;I had found you an&#10;interesting character.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes. At least I am THAT; many like me do not exist.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Pardon me; I have met several.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Perhaps you have.&#34; After which utterance, doubtfully drawled,&#10;the speaker added more sticks to the fire.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Eventide was falling with tardy languor, but, as yet, the sun,&#10;though become a gigantic, dull, red lentil in appearance, was not&#10;hidden, and the waves were still powerless to besprinkle his&#10;downward road of fire. Presently, however, he subsided into a cloud&#10;bank; whereupon darkness flooded the earth like water poured from&#10;an empty basin, and the great kindly stars shone forth, and the&#10;nocturnal profundity, enveloping the world, seemed to soften it&#10;even as a human heart may be rendered gentle.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Good-bye!&#34; I said as I pressed my companion&#39;s small, yielding&#10;hand: whereupon he looked me in the eyes in his open, boyish way,&#10;and replied:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I wish I were going with you!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well, come with me as far as Gudaout.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, I will.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So we set forth once more to traverse the land which I, so alien&#10;to its inhabitants, yet so at one with all that it contained, loved&#10;so dearly, and of which I yearned to fertilise the life in return&#10;for the vitality with which it had filled my own existence.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For daily, the threads with which my heart was bound to the&#10;world at large were growing more numerous; daily my heart was&#10;storing up something which had at its root a sense of love for&#10;life, of interest in my fellow-man.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And that evening, as we proceeded on our way, the sea was&#10;singing its vespertinal hymn, the rocks were rumbling as the water&#10;caressed them, and on the furthermost edge of the dark void there&#10;were floating dim white patches where the sunset&#39;s glow had not yet&#10;faded&#8212;though already stars were glowing in the zenith. Meanwhile&#10;every slumbering treetop was aquiver, and as I stepped across the&#10;scattered rain-pools, their water gurgled dreamily, timidly under&#10;my feet.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Yes, that night I was a torch unto myself, for in my breast a&#10;red flame was smouldering like a living beacon, and leading me to&#10;long that some frightened, belated wayfarer should, as it were,&#10;sight my little speck of radiancy amid the darkness.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 19, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/3920')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('The Dead Man'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;One evening I was sauntering along a soft, grey, dusty track&#10;between two breast-high walls of grain. So narrow was the track&#10;that here and there tar-besmeared cars were lying&#8212;tangled, broken,&#10;and crushed&#8212;in the ruts of the cartway.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Field mice squeaked as a heavy car first swayed&#8212;then bent&#10;forwards towards the sun-baked earth. A number of martins and&#10;swallows were flitting in the sky, and constituting a sign of the&#10;immediate proximity of dwellings and a river; though for the&#10;moment, as my eyes roved over the sea of gold, they encountered&#10;naught beyond a belfry rising to heaven like a ship&#39;s mast, and&#10;some trees which from afar looked like the dark sails of a ship.&#10;Yes, there was nothing else to be seen save the brocaded,&#10;undulating steppe where gently it sloped away south-westwards. And&#10;as was the earth&#39;s outward appearance, so was that of the&#10;sky&#8212;equally peaceful.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Invariably, the steppe makes one feel like a fly on a platter.&#10;Invariably, it inclines one to believe, when the centre of the&#10;expanse is reached, that the earth lies within the compass of the&#10;sky, with the sun embracing it, and the stars hemming it about as,&#10;half-blinded, they stare at the sun&#39;s beauty.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Presently the sun&#39;s huge, rosy-red disk impinged upon the blue&#10;shadows of the horizon before preparing to sink into a snow-white&#10;cloud-bank; and as it did so it bathed the ears of grain around me&#10;in radiance and caused the cornflowers to seem the darker by&#10;comparison; and the stillness, the herald of night, to accentuate&#10;more than ever the burden of the earth&#39;s song.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Fanwise then spread the ruddy beams over the firmament; and, in&#10;so doing, they cast upon my breast a shaft of light like Moses&#39;&#10;rod, and awoke therein a flood of calm, but ardent, sentiments&#10;which set me longing to embrace all the evening world, and to pour&#10;into its ear great, eloquent, and never previously voiced,&#10;utterances.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now, too, the firmament began to spangle itself with stars; and&#10;since the earth is equally a star, and is peopled with humankind, I&#10;found myself longing to traverse every road throughout the&#10;universe, and to behold, dispassionately, all the joys and sorrows&#10;of life, and to join my fellows in drinking honey mixed with&#10;gall.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Yet also there was upon me a feeling of hunger, for not since&#10;the morning had my wallet contained a morsel of food. Which&#10;circumstance hindered the process of thought, and intermittently&#10;vexed me with the reflection that, rich though is the earth, and&#10;much thence though humanity has won by labour, a man may yet be&#10;forced to walk hungry&#8230; .&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Suddenly the track swerved to the right, and as the walls of&#10;grain opened out before me, there lay revealed a steppe valley,&#10;with, flowing at its bottom, a blue rivulet, and spanning the&#10;rivulet, a newly-constructed bridge which, with its reflection in&#10;the water, looked as yellow as though fashioned of rope. On the&#10;further side of the rivulet some seven white huts lay pressed&#10;against a small declivity that was crowned with a cattle-fold, and&#10;amid the silver-grey trunks of some tall black poplars whose&#10;shadows, where they fell upon the hamlet, seemed as soft as down a&#10;knee-haltered horse, was stumping with swishing tail. And though&#10;the air, redolent of smoke and tar and hemp ensilage, was filled&#10;with the sounds of poultry cackling and a baby crying during the&#10;process of being put to bed, the hubbub in no way served to dispel&#10;the illusion that everything in the valley was but part of a sketch&#10;executed by an artistic hand, and cast in soft tints which the sun&#10;had since caused, in some measure, to fade.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In the centre of the semi-circle of huts there stood a&#10;brick-kiln, and next to it, a high, narrow red chapel which&#10;resembled a one-eyed watchman. And as I stood gazing at the scene&#10;in general, a crane stooped with a faint and raucous cry, and a&#10;woman who had come out to draw water looked as though, as she&#10;raised bare arms to stretch herself upwards&#8212;cloud-like, and&#10;white-robed from head to foot&#8212;she were about to float away&#10;altogether.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Also, near the brick-kiln there lay a patch of black mud in the&#10;glistening, crumpled-velvet blue substance of which two urchins of&#10;five and three were, breechless, and naked from the waist upwards,&#10;kneading yellow feet amid a silence as absorbed as though their one&#10;desire in life had been to impregnate the mud with the red radiance&#10;of the sun. And so much did this laudable task interest me, and&#10;engage my sympathy and attention, that I stopped to watch the&#10;strapping youngsters, seeing that even in mire the sun has a&#10;rightful place, for the reason that the deeper the sunlight&#39;s&#10;penetration of the soil, the better does that soil become, and the&#10;greater the benefit to the people dwelling on its surface.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Viewed from above, the scene lay, as it were, in the palm of&#10;one&#39;s hand. True, by no manner of means could such lowly farm cots&#10;provide me with a job, but at least should I, for that evening, be&#10;able to enjoy the luxury of a chat with the cots&#39; kindly&#10;inhabitants. Hence, with, in my mind, a base and mischievous&#10;inclination to retail to those inhabitants tales of the marvellous&#10;kind of which I knew them to stand wellnigh as much in need as of&#10;bread, I resumed my way, and approached the bridge.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As I did so, there arose from the ground-level an animated clod&#10;of earth in the shape of a sturdy individual. Unwashed and&#10;unshaven, he had hanging on his frame an open canvas shirt, grey&#10;with dust, and baggy blue breeches.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Good evening,&#34; I said to the fellow.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I wish you the same,&#34; he replied. &#34;Whither are you bound?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;First of all, what is the name of this river?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What is its name? Why, it is the Sagaidak, of course.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;On the man&#39;s large, round head there was a shock of bristling,&#10;grizzled curls, while pendent to the moustache below it were ends&#10;like those of the moustache of a Chinaman. Also, as his small eyes&#10;scanned me with an air of impudent distrust, I could detect that&#10;they were engaged in counting the holes and dams in my raiment.&#10;Only after a long interval did he draw a deep breath as from his&#10;pocket he produced a clay pipe with a cane mouthpiece, and,&#10;knitting his brows attentively, fell to peering into the pipe&#39;s&#10;black bowl. Then he said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Have you matches?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I replied in the affirmative.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And some tobacco?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For awhile he continued to contemplate the sun where that&#10;luminary hung suspended above a cloud-bank before finally&#10;declining. Then he remarked:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Give me a pinch of the tobacco. As for matches, I have&#10;some.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So both of us lit up; after which he rested his elbows upon the&#10;balustrade of the bridge, leant back against the central&#10;stanchions, and for some time continued merely to emit and inhale&#10;blue coils of smoke. Then his nose wrinkled, and he&#10;expectorated.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Muscovite tobacco is it?&#34; he inquired.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No&#8212;Roman, Italian.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh!&#34; And as the wrinkles of his nose straightened themselves&#10;again he added: &#34;Then of course it is good tobacco.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;To enter a dwelling in advance of one&#39;s host is a breach of&#10;decorum; wherefore, I found myself forced to remain standing where&#10;I was until my interlocutor&#39;s tale of questions as to my precise&#10;identity, my exact place of origin, my true destination, and my&#10;real reasons for travelling should tardily win its way to a finish.&#10;Greatly the process vexed me, for I was eager, rather, to learn&#10;what the steppe settlement might have in store for my&#10;delectation.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Work?&#34; the fellow drawled through his teeth. &#34;Oh no, there is&#10;no work to be got here. How could there be at this season of the&#10;year?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Turning aside, he spat into the rivulet.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;On the further bank of the latter, a goose was strutting&#10;importantly at the head of a string of round, fluffy, yellow&#10;goslings, whilst driving the brood were two little girls&#8212;the one a&#10;child but little larger than the goose itself, dressed in a red&#10;frock, and armed with a switch; and the other one a youngster&#10;absolutely of a size with the bird, pale of feature, plump of body,&#10;bowed of leg, and grave of expression.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ufim!&#34; came at this moment in the strident voice of a woman&#10;unseen, but incensed; upon which my companion bestowed upon me a&#10;sidelong nod, and muttered with an air of appreciation:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;THERE&#39;S lungs for you!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Whereafter, he fell to twitching the toes of a chafed and&#10;blackened foot, and to gazing at their nails. His next question&#10;was:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Are you, maybe, a scholar?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why do you ask?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Because, if you are, you might like to read the Book over a&#10;corpse.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And so proud, apparently, was he of the proposal that a faint&#10;smile crossed his flaccid countenance.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You see, it would be work,&#34; he added with his brown eyes&#10;veiled, &#34;whilst, in addition, you would be paid ten kopecks for&#10;your trouble, and allowed to keep the shroud.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And should also be given some supper, I suppose?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes&#8212;and should also be given some supper.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Where is the corpse lying?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;In my own hut. Shall we go there?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Off we set. En route we heard once more a strident shout of:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ufi-i-im!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As we proceeded, shadows of trees glided along the soft road to&#10;meet us, while behind a clump of bushes on the further bank of the&#10;rivulet some children were shouting at their play. Thus, what with&#10;the children&#39;s voices, and the purling of the water, and the noise&#10;of someone planing a piece of wood, the air seemed full of&#10;tremulous, suspended sound. Meanwhile, my host said to me with a&#10;drawl:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Once we did have a reader here. An old woman she was, a regular&#10;old witch who at last had to be removed to the town for amputation&#10;of the feet. They might well have cut off her tongue too whilst&#10;they were about it, since, though useful enough, she could rail&#10;indeed!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Presently a black puppy, a creature of about the size of a toad,&#10;came ambling, three-legged fashion, under our feet. Upon that it&#10;stiffened its tail, growled, and snuffed the air with its tiny pink&#10;nose.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Next there popped up from somewhere or another a barefooted&#10;young woman. Clapping her hands, she bawled:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Here, you Ufim, how I have been calling for you, and calling&#10;for you!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Eh? Well, I never heard you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Where were you, then?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;By way of reply, my conductor silently pointed in my direction&#10;with the stem of his pipe. Then he led me into the forecourt of the&#10;hut next to the one whence the young woman had issued, whilst she&#10;proceeded to project fresh volleys of abuse, and fresh expressions&#10;of accentuated non-amiability.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In the little doorway of the dwelling next to hers, we found&#10;seated two old women. One of them was as rotund and dishevelled as&#10;a battered, leathern ball, and the other one was a woman bony and&#10;crooked of back, swarthy of skin, and irritable of feature. At the&#10;women&#39;s feet lay, lolling out a rag-like tongue, a shaggy dog&#10;which, red and pathetic of eye, could boast of a frame nearly as&#10;large as a sheep&#39;s.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;First of all, Ufim related in detail how he had fallen in with&#10;myself. Then he stated the purpose for which he conceived it was&#10;possible that I might prove useful. And all the time that he was&#10;speaking, two pairs of eyes contemplated him in silence; until, on&#10;the completion of his recital, one of the old women gave a jerk to&#10;a thin, dark neck, and the other old dame invited me to take a seat&#10;whilst she prepared some supper.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Amid the tangled herbage of the forecourt, a spot overgrown with&#10;mallow and bramble shoots, there was standing a cart which, lacking&#10;wheels, had its axle-points dark with mildew. Presently a herd of&#10;cattle was driven past the hut, and over the hamlet there seemed to&#10;arise, drift, and float, a perfect wave of sound. Also, as evening&#10;descended, I could see an ever-increasing number of grey shadows&#10;come creeping forth from the forecourt&#39;s recesses, and overlaying&#10;and darkening the turf.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;One day all of us must die,&#34; remarked Ufim, with empressement&#10;as he tapped the bowl of his pipe against a wall.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The next moment the barefooted, red-cheeked young woman showed&#10;herself at the gate, and asked in tones rather less vehement than&#10;recently:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Are you coming, or are you not?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Presently,&#34; replied Ufim. &#34;One thing at a time.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For supper I was given a hunch of bread and a bowl of milk;&#10;whereupon the dog rose, laid its aged, slobbering muzzle upon my&#10;knee, and gazed into my face with its dim eyes as though it were&#10;saying, &#34;May I too have a bite?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Next, like an eventide breeze among withered herbage, there&#10;floated across the forecourt the hoarse voice of the crook-backed&#10;old woman.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Let us pray,&#34; she said. &#34;Oh God, take away from us all sorrow,&#10;and receive therefore requitement in twofold measure!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As she recited the prayer with a mien as dark as fate, the&#10;supplicant rolled her long neck from side to side, and nodded her&#10;ophidian-shaped head in accordance with a sort of regular,&#10;lethargic rhythm. Next I heard sink to earth, at my feet, some&#10;senile words uttered in a sort of singsong.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Some folk need work just as much as they wish, and others need&#10;do no work at all. Yet OUR folk have to work beyond their strength,&#10;and to work without any recompense for the toil which they&#10;undergo.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Upon this the smaller of the old crones whispered:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But the Mother of God will recompense them. She recompenses&#10;everyone.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then a dead silence fell&#8212;a weighty silence, a silence seemingly&#10;fraught with matters of import, and inspiring in one an assurance&#10;that presently there would be brought forth impressive&#10;reflections&#8212;there would reach the ear words of mark.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I may tell you,&#34; at length the crook-backed old woman remarked&#10;as she attempted to straighten herself, &#34;that though my husband was&#10;not without enemies, he also had a particular friend named Andrei,&#10;and that when failing strength was beginning to make life difficult&#10;for us in our old home on the Don, and folk took to reviling and&#10;girding at my husband, Andrei came to us one day, and said: &#39;Yakov,&#10;let not your hands fail you, for the earth is large, and in all&#10;parts has been given to men for their use. If folk be cruel, they&#10;are so through stupidity and prejudice, and must not be judged for&#10;being so. Live your own life. Let theirs be theirs, and yours&#10;yours, so that, dwelling in peace, while yielding to none, you&#10;shall in time overcome them all.&#39;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That is what Vasil too used to say. He used to say: &#39;Let theirs&#10;be theirs, and ours ours.&#39;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Aye, never a good word dies, but, wheresoever it be uttered,&#10;flies thence through the world like a swallow.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Ufim corroborated this with a nod.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;True indeed!&#34; he remarked. &#34;Though also it has been said that a&#10;good word is Christ&#39;s, and a bad word the priest&#39;s.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;One of the old women shook her head vigorously at this, and&#10;croaked:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The badness lies not in any word of a priest, but in what you&#10;yourself have just said. You are greyheaded, Ufim, yet often you&#10;speak without thought.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Presently Ufim&#39;s wife reappeared, and, waving her hands as&#10;though she were brandishing a sieve, began to vent renewed volleys&#10;of virulent abuse.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My God,&#34; she cried, &#34;what sort of a man is that? Why, a man who&#10;neither speaks nor listens, but for ever keeps baying at the moon&#10;like a dog!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;NOW she&#39;s started!&#34; Ufim drawled.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Westward there were arising, and soaring skyward, clouds of such&#10;a similarity to blue smoke and blood-red flame that the steppe&#10;seemed almost to be in danger of catching fire thence. Meanwhile a&#10;soft evening breeze was caressing the expanse as a whole, and&#10;causing the grain to bend drowsily earthward as golden-red ripples&#10;skimmed its surface. Only in the eastern quarter whence night&#39;s&#10;black, sultry shadow was stealthily creeping in our direction had&#10;darkness yet descended.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At intervals there came vented from the window above my head the&#10;hot odour of a dead body; and, whenever that happened, the dog&#39;s&#10;grey nostrils and muzzle would quiver, and its eyes would blink&#10;pitifully as it gazed aloft. Glancing at the heavens, Ufim remarked&#10;with conviction:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;There will be no rain tonight.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Do you keep such a thing as a Psalter here?&#34; I inquired.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Such a thing as a what?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;As a Psalter&#8212;a book?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;No answer followed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Faster and faster the southern night went on descending, and&#10;wiping the land clean of heat, as though that heat had been dust.&#10;Upon me there came a feeling that I should like to go and bury&#10;myself in some sweet-smelling hay, and sleep there until&#10;sunrise.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Maybe Panek has one of those things?&#34; hazarded Ufim after a&#10;long pause. &#34;At any rate he has dealings with the Molokans.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;After that, the company held further converse in whispers. Then&#10;all save the more rotund of the old women left the forecourt, while&#10;its remaining occupant said to me with a sigh:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You may come and look at him if you wish.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Small and gentle looked the woman&#39;s meekly lowered head as,&#10;folding her hands across her breast, she added in a whisper:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh purest Mother of God! Oh Thou of spotless chastity!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In contrast to her expression, that on the face of the dead man&#10;was stem and, as it were, fraught with importance where thick grey&#10;eyebrows lay parted over a large nose, and the latter curved&#10;downwards towards a moustache which divided introspective,&#10;partially closed eyes from a mouth that was set half-open. Indeed,&#10;it was as though the man were pondering something of annoyance, so&#10;that presently he would make shift to deliver himself of a final&#10;and urgent injunction. The blue smoke of a meagre candle quivered&#10;meanwhile, over his head, though the wick diffused so feeble a&#10;light that the death blurs under the eyes and in the cheek furrows&#10;lay uneffaced, and the dark hands and wrists, disposed, lumplike,&#10;on the front of the greyish-blue shroud, seemed to have had their&#10;fingers twisted in a manner which even death had failed to rectify.&#10;And ever and anon, streaming from door to window, came a draught&#10;variously fraught with the odours of wormwood, mint, and&#10;corruption.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Presently the old woman&#39;s whispering grew more animated and&#10;intelligible, while constantly, amid the wheezed mutterings, sheet&#10;lightning cut the black square of the window space with menacing&#10;flashes, and seemed, with their blue glare, as it shot through the&#10;tomblike hut, to cause the candle&#39;s flickering flame to undergo a&#10;temporary extinction, a temporary withdrawal, and the grey bristles&#10;on the dead man&#39;s face to gleam like the scales of a fish, and his&#10;features to gather themselves into a grim frown. Meanwhile, like a&#10;stream of cold, bitter water dripping upon my breast, the old&#10;woman&#39;s whispered soliloquy maintained its uninterrupted flow.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At length there recurred, somehow, to my mind the words which,&#10;impressive though they be, never can assuage sorrow&#8212;the words:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Weep not for me, Martha, nor gaze into the tomb, for, lo, I am&#10;risen!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Nay, and never would THIS man rise again&#8230; .&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Presently the bony old woman returned with a report that nowhere&#10;among the huts could a Psalter be found, but only a book of another&#10;kind. Would it do?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The other book turned out to be a grammar of the Church Slavonic&#10;dialect, with the first pages torn out, and beginning with the&#10;words, &#34;Drug, drugi, druzhe.&#34; [&#34;A friend, of a friend, O&#10;friend.&#34;]&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What, then, are we to do?&#34; vexedly asked the smaller of the&#10;dames when I had explained to her that a grammar could work no&#10;benefit to a corpse. As she put the query, her small, childlike&#10;face quivered with disappointment, and her eyes swelled and&#10;overflowed with tears.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My man has lived his life,&#34; she said with a sob, &#34;and now he&#10;cannot even be given proper burial!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And, similarly, when next I offered to recite over her husband&#10;each and every prayer and psalm that I could contrive to recall to&#10;my recollection, on condition that all present should meanwhile&#10;leave the hut (for I felt that, since the task would be one novel&#10;to me, the attendance of auditors might hinder me from mustering my&#10;entire stock of petitions), she so disbelieved me, or failed to&#10;understand me, that for long enough she could only stand tottering&#10;in the doorway as, with twitching nose, she drew her sleeve across&#10;her worn, diminutive features.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Nevertheless she did, at last, take her departure.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Low over the steppe, stray flashes of summer lightning still&#10;gleamed against the jet black sky as they flooded the hut with&#10;their lurid shimmer; and each time that the darkness of the sultry&#10;night swept back into the room, the candle flickered, and the&#10;corpse&#39;s prone figure seemed to open its half-closed eyes and&#10;glance at the shadows which palpitated on its breast, and danced&#10;over the white walls and ceiling.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Similarly did I glance from time to time at HIM, yet glance with&#10;a guarded eye, and with a feeling in me that when a corpse is&#10;present anything may happen; until finally I rallied conscience to&#10;my aid, and recited under my breath:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Pardon Thou all who have sinned, whether they be men, or&#10;whether they, being not men, do yet stand higher than the beasts of&#10;the field.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;However, the only result of the recitation was to bring to my&#10;mind a thought directly at variance with the import of the words,&#10;the thought that &#34;it is not sin that is hard and bitter to ensue,&#10;but righteousness.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Sins wilful and of ignorance,&#34; I continued. &#34;Sins known and&#10;unknown. Sins committed through imprudence and evil example. Sins&#10;committed through forwardness and sloth.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Though to YOU, brother,&#34; mentally I added to the corpse, &#34;none&#10;of this, of course, applies.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Again, glancing at the blue stars, where they hung glittering in&#10;the fathomless obscurity of the sky, I reflected:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Who in this house is looking at them save myself?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Presently, with a pattering of claws over the beaten clay of the&#10;floor, there entered the dog. Once or twice it paced the length of&#10;the room. Then, with a sniff at my legs, and a grumble to itself,&#10;it departed as it had come. Perhaps the creature felt too old to&#10;bay a dirge to its master after the manner of its kind. In any&#10;case, as it vanished through the doorway, the shadows&#8212;so I&#10;fancied&#8212;sought to slip out after it, and, floating in that&#10;direction, fanned my face with a breath as of ice, while the flame&#10;of the candle flickered the more&#8212;as though it too were seeking to&#10;wrest itself from the candlestick, and go floating upwards to join&#10;the band of stars&#8212;a band of luminaries which it might well have&#10;deemed to be of a brilliance as small and as pitiful as its own.&#10;And I, for my part, since I had no wish to see what light there was&#10;disappear, followed the struggles of the tiny flame with a tense&#10;anxiety which made my eyes ache. Oppressed and uneasy all over as I&#10;stood by the dead man&#39;s shoulder, I strained my ears and listened,&#10;listened ever, to the silence encompassing the hut.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Eventually, drowsiness began to steal over me, and proved a&#10;feeling hard to resist. Yet still with an effort did I contrive to&#10;recall the beautiful prayers of Saints Makari Veliki, Chrysostom,&#10;and Damarkin, while at the same time something resembling a swarm&#10;of mosquitos started to hum in my head, the words wherein the Sixth&#10;Precept issues its injunction to: &#34;all persons about to withdraw to&#10;a couch of rest.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And next, to escape falling asleep, I fell to reciting the&#10;kondak [Hymn for the end of the day] which begins:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh Lord, refresh my soul thus grievously made feeble with wrong&#10;doing.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Still engaged in this manner, suddenly I heard something rustle&#10;outside the door. Then a dry whisper articulated:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh God of Mercy, receive unto Thyself also my soul!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Upon that, the fancy occurred to me that probably the old&#10;woman&#39;s soul was as grey and timid as a linnet, and that when it&#10;should fly up to the throne of the Mother of God, and the Mother&#10;should extend to that little soul her tender, white, and gracious&#10;hand, the newcomer would tremble all over, and flutter her gentle&#10;wings until well nigh death should supervene.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And then the Mother of God would say to Her Son:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Son, pray see the fearfulness of Thy people on earth, and their&#10;estrangement from joy! Oh Son, is that well?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And He would make answer to Her&#8212;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He would make answer to Her, and say I know not what.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And suddenly, so I fancied, a voice answered mine out of the&#10;brooding hush, as though it too were reciting a prayer. Yet so&#10;complete, so profound, was the stillness, that the voice seemed far&#10;away, submerged, unreal&#8212;a mere phantom of an echo, of the echo of&#10;my own voice. Until, on my desisting from my recital, and straining&#10;my cars yet more, the sound seemed to approach and grow clearer as&#10;shuffling footsteps also advanced in my direction, and there came a&#10;mutter of:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Nay, it CANNOT be so!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why is it that the dogs have failed to bark?&#34; I reflected,&#10;rubbing my eyes, and fancying as I did so that the dead man&#39;s&#10;eyebrows twitched, and his moustache stirred in a grim smile.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Presently a deep, hoarse, rasping voice vociferated in the&#10;forecourt:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What do you say, old woman? Yes, that he must die&#8212;I knew all&#10;along,&#8212;so you can cease your chattering? Men like him keep up to&#10;the last, then lay them down to rise to more&#8230; WHO is with him? A&#10;stranger? A-ah!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And, the next moment, a bulk so large and shapeless that it&#10;might well have been the darkness of the night embodied, stumbled&#10;against the outer side of the door, grunted, hiccuped, and lurching&#10;head foremost into the hut, grew wellnigh to the ceiling. Then it&#10;waved a gigantic hand, crossed itself in the direction of the&#10;candle, and, bending forward until its forehead almost touched the&#10;feet of the corpse, queried under its breath:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;How now, Vasil?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Thereafter, the figure vented a sob whilst a strong smell of&#10;vodka arose in the room, and from the doorway the old woman said in&#10;an appealing voice:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Pray give HIM the book, Father Demid.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No indeed! Why should I? I intend to do the reading&#10;myself.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And a heavy hand laid itself upon my shoulder, while a great&#10;hairy face bent over mine, and inquired:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;A young man, are you not? A member of the clergy, too, I&#10;suppose?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So covered with tufts of auburn hair was the enormous head above&#10;me&#8212;tufts the sheen of which even the semi-obscurity of the pale&#10;candlelight failed to render inconspicuous&#8212;that the mass, as a&#10;whole, resembled a mop. And as its owner lurched to and fro, he&#10;made me lurch responsively by now drawing me towards himself, now&#10;thrusting me away. Meanwhile he continued to suffuse my face with&#10;the hot, thick odour of spirituous liquor.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Father Demid!&#34; again essayed the old woman with an imploring&#10;wail, but he cut her short with the menacing admonition:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;How often have I told you that you must not address a deacon as&#10;&#39;Father&#39;? Go to bed! Yes, be off with you, and let me mind my&#10;affairs myself! GO, I say! But first light me another candle, for I&#10;cannot see a single thing in front of me.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With which, throwing himself upon a bench, the deacon slapped&#10;his knee with a book which he had in his hands, and put to me the&#10;query:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Should you care to have a dram of gorielka? [Another name for&#10;vodka.]&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No,&#34; I replied. &#34;At all events, not here.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Indeed?&#34; the deacon cried, unabashed. &#34;But come, a bottle of&#10;the stuff is here, in my very pocket.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;This is no place in which to be drinking.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For a moment the deacon said nothing. Then he muttered:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;True, true. So let us adjourn to the forecourt&#8230; . Yes, what you&#10;say is no more than the truth.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Had you not better remain seated where you are, and begin the&#10;reading?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No, I am going to do no such thing. YOU shall do the reading.&#10;Tonight I, I&#8212;well I am not very well, for I have been drinking a&#10;little.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And, thrusting the book into my stomach, he sank his head upon&#10;his breast, and fell to swaying it ponderously up and down.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Folk die,&#34; was his next utterance, &#34;and the world remains as&#10;full of grief as ever. Yes, folk die even before they have seen a&#10;little good accrue to themselves.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I see that your book is not a Psalter,&#34; here I interposed after&#10;an inspection of the volume.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You are wrong.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Then look for yourself.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He grabbed the book by its cover, and, by dint of holding the&#10;candle close to its pages, discovered, eventually, that matters&#10;were as I had stated.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;This took him aback completely.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What can the fact mean?&#34; he exclaimed. &#34;Oh, I know what has&#10;happened. The mistake has come of my being in such a hurry. The&#10;other book, the true Psalter, is a fat, heavy volume, whereas this&#10;one is&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For a moment he seemed sobered by the shock. At all events, he&#10;rose and, approaching the corpse, said, as he bent over the bed&#10;with his beard held back:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Pardon me, Vasil, but what is to be done?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then he straightened himself again, threw back his curls, and,&#10;drawing a bottle from his pocket, and thrusting the neck of the&#10;bottle into his mouth, took a long draught, with a whistling of his&#10;nostrils as he did so.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well?&#34; I said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well, I intend to go to bed&#8212;my idea is to drink and enjoy&#10;myself awhile.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Go, then.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And what of the reading?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Who would wish you to mumble words which you would not be&#10;comprehending as you uttered them?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The deacon reseated himself upon the bench, leaned forward,&#10;buried his face in his hands and remained silent.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Fast the July night was waning. Fast its shadows were dissolving&#10;into corners, and allowing a whiff of fresh dewy morningtide to&#10;enter at the window. Already was the combined light of the two&#10;candles growing paler, with their flames looking like the eyes of a&#10;frightened child.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You have lived your life, Vasi,&#34; at length the deacon muttered,&#10;&#34;and though once I had a place to which to resort, now I shall have&#10;none. Yes, my last friend is dead. Oh Lord&#8212;where is Thy&#10;justice?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For myself, I went and took a seat by the window, and, thrusting&#10;my head into the open air, lit a pipe, and continued to listen with&#10;a shiver to the deacon&#39;s wailings.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Folk used to gird at my wife,&#34; he went on, &#34;and now they are&#10;gnawing at me as pigs might gnaw at a cabbage. That is so, Vasil.&#10;Yes that is so.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Again the bottle made its appearance. Again the deacon took a&#10;draught. Again he wiped his beard. Then he bent over the dead man&#10;once more, and kissed the corpse&#39;s forehead.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Good-bye, friend of mine!&#34; he said. Then to myself he added&#10;with unlooked-for clarity and vigour:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My friend here was but a plain man&#8212;a man as inconspicuous among&#10;his fellows as a rook among a flock of rooks. Yet no rook was he.&#10;Rather, he was a snow-white dove, though none but I realised the&#10;fact. And now he has been withdrawn from the &#39;grievous bondage of&#10;Pharaoh.&#39; Only I am left. Verily, after my passing, shall my soul&#10;torment and vomit spittle upon his adversaries!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Have you known much sorrow?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The deacon did not reply at once. When he did so he said&#10;dully:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;All of us have known much sorrow. In some cases we have known&#10;more than was rightfully our due. I certainly, have known much. But&#10;go to sleep, for only in sleep do we recover what is ours.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And he added as he tripped over his own feet, and lurched&#10;heavily against me:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I have a longing to sing something. Yet I feel that I had best&#10;not, for song at such an hour awakens folk, and starts them&#10;bawling&#8230; But beyond all things would I gladly sing.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With which he buzzed into my ear:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p class=&#34;poem&#34;&#62;&#34;To whom shall I sing of my grief?&#60;br /&#62;&#10;To whom resort for relief?&#60;br /&#62;&#10;To the One in whose ha-a-and&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At this point the sharp bristles of his beard so tickled my neck&#10;as to cause me to edge further away.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You do not like me?&#34; he queried. &#34;Then go to sleep, and to the&#10;devil too!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It was your beard that was tickling me.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Indeed? Ought I to have shaved for your benefit before I&#10;came?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He reflected awhile&#8212;then subsided on to the floor with a sniff&#10;and an angry exclamation of:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Read, you, whilst I sleep. And see to it that you do not make&#10;off with the book, for it belongs to the church, and is very&#10;valuable. Yes. I know you hard-ups! Why do you go roaming about as&#10;you do&#8212;what is it you hope to gain by your tramping?&#8230; However,&#10;tramp as much as you like. Yes, be off, and tell people that a&#10;deacon has come by misfortune, and is in need of some good person&#10;to take pity upon his plight&#8230; . Diomid Kubasov my name is&#8212;that of a&#10;man lost beyond recall.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With which he fell asleep. Opening the book at random, I read&#10;the words:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;A land unapportioned that shall produce a nourisher of&#10;humanity, a being that shall put forth the bounty of his hand to&#10;feed every creature.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;A nourisher of humanity.&#34; Before my eyes that &#34;nourisher&#34; lay&#10;outspread, a nourisher overlaid with dry and fragrant herbage. And&#10;as I gazed, in the haze of a vision, upon that nourisher&#39;s dark and&#10;enigmatical face, I saw also the thousands of men who have seamed&#10;this earth with furrows, to the end that dead things should become&#10;things of life. And in particular, there uprose before me a picture&#10;strange indeed. In that picture I saw marching over the steppe,&#10;where the expanse lay bare and void&#8212;yes, marching in circles that&#10;increasingly embraced a widening area&#8212;a gigantic, thousand-handed&#10;being in whose train the dead steppe gathered unto itself vitality,&#10;and became swathed in juicy, waving verdure, and studded with towns&#10;and villages. And ever, as the being receded further and further&#10;into the distance, could I see him sowing with tireless hands that&#10;which had in it life, and was part of himself, and human as, with&#10;thoughts intent upon the benefiting of humanity, he summoned all&#10;men to put forth the mysterious force that is in them, and thus to&#10;conquer death, and eternally and invincibly to convert, dead things&#10;into things of life, while traversing in company the road of death&#10;towards that which has no knowledge of death, and ensuring that, in&#10;swallowing up mankind, the jaws of death should not close upon&#10;death&#39;s victims.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And this caused my heart to beat with emotions the pulsing wings&#10;of which at once gladdened me, and cooled my fervour&#8230; And how&#10;greatly, at that moment, did I feel the need of someone able to&#10;respond to my questions without passion, yet with truth, and in the&#10;language of simplicity! For beside me there lay but a man dead and&#10;a man drunken, while without the threshold there was stationed one&#10;who had far outlived her span of years. No matter, however. If not&#10;today, then tomorrow, should I find a fellow-creature with whom my&#10;soul might commune.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mentally I left the hut, and passed on to the steppe, that I&#10;might contemplate thence the little dwelling in which alone, though&#10;lost amid the earth&#39;s immensity, the windows were not blind and&#10;black as in its fellow huts, but showed, burning over the head of a&#10;dead human being, the fire which humanity had conquered for&#10;humanity&#39;s benefit.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And that heart which had ceased to beat in the dead man&#8212;had&#10;everything conceived in life by that heart found due expression in&#10;a world poverty, stricken of heart-conceived ideas? I knew that the&#10;man just passed away had been but a plain and insignificant mortal,&#10;yet as I reflected upon even the little that he had done, his&#10;labour loomed before me as greater than prowess of larger&#10;magnitude. Yes, to my mind there recurred the immature, battered&#10;ears of corn lying in the ruts of the steppe track, the swallows&#10;traversing the blue sky above the golden, brocaded grain, the kite&#10;hovering in the void over the landscape&#39;s vast periphery&#8230; ..&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And along with these thoughts, there struck upon my ears a&#10;whistling of pinions as the shadow of a bird flitted across the&#10;brilliant, dew-bespangled green of the forecourt, and five cocks&#10;crowed in succession, and a flock of geese announced the fact of&#10;their awakening, and a cow lowed, and the gate of the cattle-pen&#10;creaked.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And with that I fell to thinking how I should like really to go&#10;out on to the steppe, and there to fall asleep under a warm, dry&#10;bank.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As for the deacon, he was still slumbering at my feet&#8212;slumbering&#10;with his breast, the breast of a prize-fighter, turned uppermost,&#10;and his fine, golden shock of hair falling like a nimbus around his&#10;head, and hot, fat, flushed red features and gaping mouth and&#10;ceaselessly twitching moustache. In passing, I had noticed that his&#10;hands were long, and that they were set upon shovel-shaped&#10;wrists.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Next I found myself imagining the scene as the powerful figure&#10;of this man embraced a woman. Probably her face would become lost&#10;to sight in his beard, until nothing of her features remained&#10;visible. Then, when the beard began to tickle her, she would throw&#10;back her head, and laugh. And the children that such a man might&#10;have begotten!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;All this only made it the more painful and disagreeable to me to&#10;reflect that the breast of a human being of such a type should be&#10;bearing a burden of sorrow. Surely naught but joy should have been&#10;present therein!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Meanwhile, the old woman&#39;s gentle face was still peering at me&#10;through the doorway, and presently the first beam of sunlight came&#10;glancing through the window-space. Above the rivulet&#39;s silky&#10;glimmer, a transparent mist lay steaming, while trees and herbage&#10;alike were passing through that curiously inert stage when at any&#10;moment (so one fancied) they might give themselves a shake, and&#10;burst into song, and in keys intelligible to the soul alone, set&#10;forth the wondrous mystery of their existence.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What a good man he is!&#34; the old woman whispered plaintively as&#10;she gazed at the deacon&#39;s gigantic frame. Whereafter, as though&#10;reading aloud from a book invisible to my sight, she proceeded&#10;quietly and simply to relate the story of his wife.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You see,&#34; she went on &#34;his lady committed a certain sin with a&#10;certain man; and folk remarked this, and, after setting the husband&#10;on to the couple, derided him&#8212;yes, him, our Demid!&#8212;for the reason&#10;that he persisted in forgiving the woman her fault. At length the&#10;jeers made her take to her room and him to liquor, and for two&#10;years past he has been drinking, and soon is going to be deprived&#10;of his office. One who scarcely drank at all, my poor husband, used&#10;to say: &#39;Ah, Demid, yield not to these folk, but live your own&#10;life, and let theirs be theirs, and yours, yours.&#39;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With the words, tears welled from the old woman&#39;s dim, small&#10;eyes, and became merged with the folds and wrinkles on her&#10;grief-stained cheeks. And in the presence of that little head, a&#10;head shaking like a dead leaf in the autumn time, and of those&#10;kindly features so worn with age and sorrow, my eyes fell, and I&#10;felt smitten with shame to find that, on searching my soul for at&#10;least a word of consolation to offer to the poor fellow-mortal&#10;before me, I could discover none that seemed suitable.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But at length there recurred to my mind some strange words which&#10;I had encountered in I know not what antique volume&#8212;words which&#10;ran:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Let not the servants of the Gods lament but, rather, rejoice,&#10;in that weeping and lamentation grieve both the Gods and&#10;mankind.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Thereafter, I muttered confusedly:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It is time that I was going.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What?&#34; was her hasty exclamation, an exclamation uttered as&#10;though the words had affrighted her. Whereafter, with quivering&#10;lips, she began hesitantly and uncertainly to fumble in her&#10;bodice.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No, I have no need of money,&#34; I interposed. &#34;Only, if you&#10;should be so willing, give me a piece of bread.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You have no need of money?&#34; she re-echoed dubiously.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No, none. For that matter, of what use could it be to me?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well, well!&#34; she said after a thoughtful pause. &#34;Then be it as&#10;you wish, and&#8212;and I thank you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The sun, as he rose and ascended towards the blue of the&#10;firmament, was spreading over the earth a braggart, peacock-like&#10;tail of beams. And as he did so, I winked at him, for by experience&#10;I knew that some two hours later his smiles would be scorching me&#10;with fire. Yet for the time being he and I had no fault to find&#10;with one another. Wherefore, I set myself to search for a bank&#10;whence I might sing to him, as to the Lord of Life:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p class=&#34;poem&#34;&#62;Oh Thou of intangible substance,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Reveal now that substance to me!&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Enwrap me within the great vestment&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Of light which encompasseth Thee!&#60;br /&#62;&#10;That with Thy uprising, my substance&#60;br /&#62;&#10;May Come all-prevailing to be!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Let us live our lives unto ourselves. Let theirs be theirs, and&#10;ours, ours.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 19, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/3920')
