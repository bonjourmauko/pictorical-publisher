I was just a girl&#10;in the village school, when, one day, your grandmother came in to&#10;ask the mistress if there was any scholar there who would do for a&#10;nurse-maid; and mighty proud I was, I can tell ye, when the&#10;mistress called me up, and spoke of me being a good girl at my&#10;needle, and a steady, honest girl, and one whose parents were very&#10;respectable, though they might be poor. I thought I should like&#10;nothing better than to serve the pretty young lady, who was&#10;blushing as deep as I was, as she spoke of the coming baby, and&#10;what I should have to do with it. However, I see you don&#39;t care so&#10;much for this part of my story, as for what you think is to come,&#10;so I&#39;ll tell you at once. I was engaged and settled at the&#10;parsonage before Miss Rosamond (that was the baby, who is now your&#10;mother) was born. To be sure, I had little enough to do with her&#10;when she came, for she was never out of her mother&#39;s arms, and&#10;slept by her all night long; and proud enough was I sometimes when&#10;missis trusted her to me. There never was such a baby before or&#10;since, though you&#39;ve all of you been fine enough in your turns; but&#10;for sweet, winning ways, you&#39;ve none of you come up to your mother.&#10;She took after her mother, who was a real lady born; a Miss&#10;Furnivall, a grand-daughter of Lord Furnivall&#39;s, in Northumberland.&#10;I believe she had neither brother nor sister, and had been brought&#10;up in my lord&#39;s family till she had married your grandfather, who&#10;was just a curate, son to a shopkeeper in Carlisle &#8212; but a clever,&#10;fine gentleman as ever was &#8212; and one who was a right-down hard&#10;worker in his parish, which was very wide, and scattered all abroad&#10;over the Westmoreland Fells. When your mother, little Miss&#10;Rosamond, was about four or five years old, both her parents died&#10;in a fortnight &#8212; one after the other. Ah! that was a sad time. My&#10;pretty young mistress and me was looking for another baby, when my&#10;master came home from one of his long rides, wet and tired, and&#10;took the fever he died of; and then she never held up her head&#10;again, but just lived to see her dead baby, and have it laid on her&#10;breast, before she sighed away her life. My mistress had asked me,&#10;on her death-bed, never to leave Miss Rosamond; but if she had&#10;never spoken a word, I would have gone with the little child to the&#10;end of the world.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The next thing, and before we had well stilled our sobs, the&#10;executors and guardians came to settle the affairs. They were my&#10;poor young mistress&#39;s own cousin, Lord Furnivall, and Mr.&#10;Esthwaite, my master&#39;s brother, a shopkeeper in Manchester; not so&#10;well to do then as he was afterwards, and with a large family&#10;rising about him. Well! I don&#39;t know if it were their settling, or&#10;because of a letter my mistress wrote on her death-bed to her&#10;cousin, my lord; but somehow it was settled that Miss Rosamond and&#10;me were to go to Furnivall Manor House, in Northumberland, and my&#10;lord spoke as if it had been her mother&#39;s wish that she should live&#10;with his family, and as if he had no objections, for that one or&#10;two more or less could make no difference in so grand a household.&#10;So, though that was not the way in which I should have wished the&#10;coming of my bright and pretty pet to have been looked at &#8212; who was&#10;like a sunbeam in any family, be it never so grand &#8212; I was well&#10;pleased that all the folks in the Dale should stare and admire,&#10;when they heard I was going to be young lady&#39;s maid at my Lord&#10;Furnivall&#39;s at Furnivall Manor.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But I made a mistake in thinking we were to go and live where my&#10;lord did. It turned out that the family had left Furnivall Manor&#10;House fifty years or more. I could not hear that my poor young&#10;mistress had never been there, though she had been brought up in&#10;the family; and I was sorry for that, for I should have liked Miss&#10;Rosamond&#39;s youth to have passed where her mother&#39;s had been.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;My lord&#39;s gentleman, from whom I asked as many questions as I&#10;durst, said that the Manor House was at the foot of the Cumberland&#10;Fells, and a very grand place; that an old Miss Furnivall, a&#10;great-aunt of my lord&#39;s, lived there, with only a few servants; but&#10;that it was a very healthy place, and my lord had thought that it&#10;would suit Miss Rosamond very well for a few years, and that her&#10;being there might perhaps amuse his old aunt.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I was bidden by my lord to have Miss Rosamond&#39;s things ready by&#10;a certain day. He was a stern, proud man, as they say all the Lords&#10;Furnivall were; and he never spoke a word more than was necessary.&#10;Folk did say he had loved my young mistress; but that, because she&#10;knew that his father would object, she would never listen to him,&#10;and married Mr. Esthwaite; but I don&#39;t know. He never married, at&#10;any rate. But he never took much notice of Miss Rosamond; which I&#10;thought he might have done if he had cared for her dead mother. He&#10;sent his gentleman with us to the Manor House, telling him to join&#10;him at Newcastle that same evening; so there was no great length of&#10;time for him to make us known to all the strangers before he, too,&#10;shook us off; and we were left, two lonely young things (I was not&#10;eighteen) in the great old Manor House. It seems like yesterday&#10;that we drove there. We had left our own dear parsonage very early,&#10;and we had both cried as if our hearts would break, though we were&#10;travelling in my lord&#39;s carriage, which I thought so much of once.&#10;And now it was long past noon on a September day, and we stopped to&#10;change horses for the last time at a little smoky town, all full of&#10;colliers and miners. Miss Rosamond had fallen asleep, but Mr. Henry&#10;told me to waken her, that she might see the park and the Manor&#10;House as we drove up. I thought it rather a pity; but I did what he&#10;bade me, for fear he should complain of me to my lord. We had left&#10;all signs of a town, or even a village, and were then inside the&#10;gates of a large wild park &#8212; not like the parks here in the south,&#10;but with rocks, and the noise of running water, and gnarled&#10;thorn-trees, and old oaks, all white and peeled with age.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The road went up about two miles, and then we saw a great and&#10;stately house, with many trees close around it, so close that in&#10;some places their branches dragged against the walls when the wind&#10;blew; and some hung broken down; for no one seemed to take much&#10;charge of the place; &#8212; to lop the wood, or to keep the moss-covered&#10;carriage-way in order. Only in front of the house all was clear.&#10;The great oval drive was without a weed; and neither tree nor&#10;creeper was allowed to grow over the long, many-windowed front; at&#10;both sides of which a wing protected, which were each the ends of&#10;other side fronts; for the house, although it was so desolate, was&#10;even grander than I expected. Behind it rose the Fells; which&#10;seemed unenclosed and bare enough; and on the left hand of the&#10;house, as you stood facing it, was a little, old-fashioned&#10;flower-garden, as I found out afterwards. A door opened out upon it&#10;from the west front; it had been scooped out of the thick, dark&#10;wood for some old Lady Furnivall; but the branches of the great&#10;forest-trees had grown and overshadowed it again, and there were&#10;very few flowers that would live there at that time.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When we drove up to the great front entrance, and went into the&#10;hall, I thought we would be lost &#8212; it was so large, and vast and&#10;grand. There was a chandelier all of bronze, hung down from the&#10;middle of the ceiling; and I had never seen one before, and looked&#10;at it all in amaze. Then, at one end of the hall, was a great&#10;fire-place, as large as the sides of the houses in my country, with&#10;massy andirons and dogs to hold the wood; and by it were heavy,&#10;old-fashioned sofas. At the opposite end of the hall, to the left&#10;as you went in &#8212; on the western side &#8212; was an organ built into the&#10;wall, and so large that it filled up the best part of that end.&#10;Beyond it, on the same side, was a door; and opposite, on each side&#10;of the fire-place, were also doors leading to the east front; but&#10;those I never went through as long as I stayed in the house, so I&#10;can&#39;t tell you what lay beyond.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The afternoon was closing in, and the hall, which had no fire&#10;lighted in it, looked dark and gloomy, but we did not stay there a&#10;moment. The old servant, who had opened the door for us, bowed to&#10;Mr. Henry, and took us in through the door at the further side of&#10;the great organ, and led us through several smaller halls and&#10;passages into the west drawing-room, where he said that Miss&#10;Furnivall was sitting. Poor little Miss Rosamond held very tight to&#10;me, as if she were scared and lost in that great place; and as for&#10;myself, I was not much better. The west drawing-room was very&#10;cheerful-looking, with a warm fire in it, and plenty of good,&#10;comfortable furniture about. Miss Furnivall was an old lady not far&#10;from eighty, I should think, but I do not know. She was thin and&#10;tall, and had a face as full of fine wrinkles as if they had been&#10;drawn all over it with a needle&#39;s point. Her eyes were very&#10;watchful, to make up, I suppose, for her being so deaf as to be&#10;obliged to use a trumpet. Sitting with her, working at the same&#10;great piece of tapestry, was Mrs. Stark, her maid and companion,&#10;and almost as old as she was. She had lived with Miss Furnivall&#10;ever since they both were young, and now she seemed more like a&#10;friend than a servant; she looked so cold, and grey, and stony, as&#10;if she had never loved or cared for any one; and I don&#39;t suppose&#10;she did care for any one, except her mistress; and, owing to the&#10;great deafness of the latter, Mrs. Stark treated her very much as&#10;if she were a child. Mr. Henry gave some message from my lord, and&#10;then he bowed good-by to us all, &#8212; taking no notice of my sweet&#10;little Miss Rosamond&#39;s outstretched hand &#8212; and left us standing&#10;there, being looked at by the two old ladies through their&#10;spectacles.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I was right glad when they rung for the old footman who had&#10;shown us in at first, and told him to take us to our rooms. So we&#10;went out of that great drawing-room and into another sitting-room,&#10;and out of that, and then up a great flight of stairs, and along a&#10;broad gallery &#8212; which was something like a library, having books&#10;all down one side, and windows and writing-tables all down the&#10;other &#8212; till we came to our rooms, which I was not sorry to hear&#10;were just over the kitchens; for I began to think I should be lost&#10;in that wilderness of a house. There was an old nursery, that had&#10;been used for all the little lords and ladies long ago, with a&#10;pleasant fire burning in the grate, and the kettle boiling on the&#10;hob, and tea-things spread out on the table; and out of that room&#10;was the night-nursery, with a little crib for Miss Rosamond close&#10;to my bed. And old James called up Dorothy, his wife, to bid us&#10;welcome; and both he and she were so hospitable and kind, that&#10;by-and-by Miss Rosamond and me felt quite at home; and by the time&#10;tea was over, she was sitting on Dorothy&#39;s knee, and chattering&#10;away as fast as her little tongue could go. I soon found out that&#10;Dorothy was from Westmoreland, and that bound her and me together,&#10;as it were; and I would never wish to meet with kinder people than&#10;were old James and his wife. James had lived pretty nearly all his&#10;life in my lord&#39;s family, and thought there was no one so grand as&#10;they. He even looked down a little on his wife; because, till he&#10;had married her, she had never lived in any but a farmer&#39;s&#10;household. But he was very fond of her, as well he might be. They&#10;had one servant under them, to do all the rough work. Agnes they&#10;called her; and she and me, and James and Dorothy, with Miss&#10;Furnivall and Mrs. Stark, made up the family; always remembering my&#10;sweet little Miss Rosamond! I used to wonder what they had done&#10;before she came, they thought so much of her now. Kitchen and&#10;drawing-room, it was all the same. The hard, sad Miss Furnivall,&#10;and the cold Mrs. Stark, looked pleased when she came fluttering in&#10;like a bird, playing and pranking hither and thither, with a&#10;continual murmur, and pretty prattle of gladness. I am sure, they&#10;were sorry many a time when she flitted away into the kitchen,&#10;though they were too proud to ask her to stay with them, and were a&#10;little surprised at her taste; though to be sure, as Mrs. Stark&#10;said, it was not to be wondered at, remembering what stock her&#10;father had come of. The great, old rambling house was a famous&#10;place for little Miss Rosamond. She made expeditions all over it,&#10;with me at her heels; all, except the east wing, which was never&#10;opened, and whither we never thought of going. But in the western&#10;and northern part was many a pleasant room; full of things that&#10;were curiosities to us, though they might not have been to people&#10;who had seen more. The windows were darkened by the sweeping boughs&#10;of the trees, and the ivy which had overgrown them; but, in the&#10;green gloom, we could manage to see old china jars and carved ivory&#10;boxes, and great heavy books, and, above all, the old pictures!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Once, I remember, my darling would have Dorothy go with us to&#10;tell us who they all were; for they were all portraits of some of&#10;my lord&#39;s family, though Dorothy could not tell us the names of&#10;every one. We had gone through most of the rooms, when we came to&#10;the old state drawing-room over the hall, and there was a picture&#10;of Miss Furnivall; or, as she was called in those days, Miss Grace,&#10;for she was the younger sister. Such a beauty she must have been!&#10;but with such a set, proud look, and such scorn looking out of her&#10;handsome eyes, with her eyebrows just a little raised, as if she&#10;wondered how anyone could have the impertinence to look at her, and&#10;her lip curled at us, as we stood there gazing. She had a dress on,&#10;the like of which I had never seen before, but it was all the&#10;fashion when she was young; a hat of some soft white stuff like&#10;beaver, pulled a little over her brows, and a beautiful plume of&#10;feathers sweeping round it on one side; and her gown of blue satin&#10;was open in front to a quilted white stomacher.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Well, to be sure!&#39; said I, when I had gazed my fill. &#39;Flesh is&#10;grass, they do say; but who would have thought that Miss Furnivall&#10;had been such an out-and-out beauty, to see her now.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Yes,&#39; said Dorothy. &#39;Folks change sadly. But if what my&#10;master&#39;s father used to say was true, Miss Furnivall, the elder&#10;sister, was handsomer than Miss Grace. Her picture is here&#10;somewhere; but, if I show it you, you must never let on, even to&#10;James, that you have seen it. Can the little lady hold her tongue,&#10;think you?&#39; asked she.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I was not so sure, for she was such a little sweet, bold,&#10;open-spoken child, so I set her to hide herself; and then I helped&#10;Dorothy to turn a great picture, that leaned with its face towards&#10;the wall, and was not hung up as the others were. To be sure, it&#10;beat Miss Grace for beauty; and, I think, for scornful pride, too,&#10;though in that matter it might be hard to choose. I could have&#10;looked at it an hour, but Dorothy seemed half frightened at having&#10;shown it to me, and hurried it back again, and bade me run and find&#10;Miss Rosamond, for that there were some ugly places about the&#10;house, where she should like ill for the child to go. I was a&#10;brave, high-spirited girl, and thought little of what the old woman&#10;said, for I liked hide-and-seek as well as any child in the parish;&#10;so off I ran to find my little one.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As winter drew on, and the days grew shorter, I was sometimes&#10;almost certain that I heard a noise as if someone was playing on&#10;the great organ in the hall. I did not hear it every evening; but,&#10;certainly, I did very often, usually when I was sitting with Miss&#10;Rosamond, after I had put her to bed, and keeping quite still and&#10;silent in the bedroom. Then I used to hear it booming and swelling&#10;away in the distance. The first night, when I went down to my&#10;supper, I asked Dorothy who had been playing music, and James said&#10;very shortly that I was a gowk to take the wind soughing among the&#10;trees for music; but I saw Dorothy look at him very fearfully, and&#10;Bessy, the kitchen-maid, said something beneath her breath, and&#10;went quite white. I saw they did not like my question, so I held my&#10;peace till I was with Dorothy alone, when I knew I could get a good&#10;deal out of her. So, the next day, I watched my time, and I coaxed&#10;and asked her who it was that played the organ; for I knew that it&#10;was the organ and not the wind well enough, for all I had kept&#10;silence before James. But Dorothy had had her lesson, I&#39;ll warrant,&#10;and never a word could I get from her. So then I tried Bessy,&#10;though I had always held my head rather above her, as I was evened&#10;to James and Dorothy, and she was little better than their servant.&#10;So she said I must never, never tell; and if ever I told, I was&#10;never to say she had told me; but it was a very strange noise, and&#10;she had heard it many a time, but most of all on winter nights, and&#10;before storms; and folks did say it was the old lord playing on the&#10;great organ in the hall, just as he used to do when he was alive;&#10;but who the old lord was, or why he played, and why he played on&#10;stormy winter evenings in particular, she either could not or would&#10;not tell me. Well! I told you I had a brave heart; and I thought it&#10;was rather pleasant to have that grand music rolling about the&#10;house, let who would be the player; for now it rose above the great&#10;gusts of wind, and wailed and triumphed just like a living&#10;creature, and then it fell to a softness most complete, only it was&#10;always music, and tunes, so it was nonsense to call it the wind. I&#10;thought at first, that it might be Miss Furnivall who played,&#10;unknown to Bessy; but one day, when I was in the hall by myself, I&#10;opened the organ and peeped all about it and around it, as I had&#10;done to the organ in Crosthwaite church once before, and I saw it&#10;was all broken and destroyed inside, though it looked so brave and&#10;fine; and then, though it was noon-day, my flesh began to creep a&#10;little, and I shut it up, and run away pretty quickly to my own&#10;bright nursery; and I did not like hearing the music for some time&#10;after that, any more than James and Dorothy did. All this time Miss&#10;Rosamond was making herself more and more beloved. The old ladies&#10;liked her to dine with them at their early dinner. James stood&#10;behind Miss Furnivall&#39;s chair, and I behind Miss Rosamond&#39;s all in&#10;state; and after dinner, she would play about in a corner of the&#10;great drawing-room as still as any mouse, while Miss Furnivall&#10;slept, and I had my dinner in the kitchen. But she was glad enough&#10;to come to me in the nursery afterwards; for, as she said, Miss&#10;Furnivall was so sad, and Mrs. Stark so dull; but she and I were&#10;merry enough; and by-and-by, I got not to care for that weird&#10;rolling music, which did one no harm, if we did not know where it&#10;came from.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;That winter was very cold. In the middle of October the frosts&#10;began, and lasted many, many weeks. I remember one day, at dinner,&#10;Miss Furnivall lifted up her sad, heavy eyes, and said to Mrs.&#10;Stark, &#39;I am afraid we shall have a terrible winter,&#39; in a strange&#10;kind of meaning way. But Mrs. Stark pretended not to hear, and&#10;talked very loud of something else. My little lady and I did not&#10;care for the frost; not we! As long as it was dry, we climbed up&#10;the steep brows behind the house, and went up on the Fells, which&#10;were bleak and bare enough, and there we ran races in the fresh,&#10;sharp air; and once we came down by a new path, that took us past&#10;the two old gnarled holly-trees, which grew about half-way down by&#10;the east side of the house. But the days grew shorter and shorter,&#10;and the old lord, if it was he, played away, more and more stormily&#10;and sadly, on the great organ. One Sunday afternoon &#8212; it must have&#10;been towards the end of November &#8212; I asked Dorothy to take charge&#10;of little missy when she came out of the drawing-room, after Miss&#10;Furnivall had had her nap; for it was too cold to take her with me&#10;to church, and yet I wanted to go. And Dorothy was glad enough to&#10;promise, and was so fond of the child, that all seemed well; and&#10;Bessy and I set off very briskly, though the sky hung heavy and&#10;black over the white earth, as if the night had never fully gone&#10;away, and the air, though still, was very biting and keen.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;We shall have a fall of snow,&#39; said Bessy to me. And sure&#10;enough, even while we were in church, it came down thick, in great&#10;large flakes, &#8212; so thick, it almost darkened the windows. It had&#10;stopped snowing before we came out, but it lay soft, thick and deep&#10;beneath our feet, as we tramped home. Before we got to the hall,&#10;the moon rose, and I think it was lighter then &#8212; what with the&#10;moon, and what with the white dazzling snow &#8212; than it had been when&#10;we went to church, between two and three o&#39;clock. I have not told&#10;you that Miss Furnivall and Mrs. Stark never went to church; they&#10;used to read the prayers together, in their quiet, gloomy way; they&#10;seemed to feel the Sunday very long without their tapestry-work to&#10;be busy at. So when I went to Dorothy in the kitchen, to fetch Miss&#10;Rosamond and take her upstairs with me, I did not much wonder when&#10;the old woman told me that the ladies had kept the child with them,&#10;and that she had never come to the kitchen, as I had bidden her,&#10;when she was tired of behaving pretty in the drawing-room. So I&#10;took off my things and went to find her, and bring her to her&#10;supper in the nursery. But when I went into the best drawing-room,&#10;there sat the two old ladies, very still and quiet, dropping out a&#10;word now and then, but looking as if nothing so bright and merry as&#10;Miss Rosamond had ever been near them. Still I thought she might be&#10;hiding from me; it was one of her pretty ways, &#8212; and that she had&#10;persuaded them to look as if they knew nothing about her; so I went&#10;softly peeping under this sofa, and behind that chair, making&#10;believe I was sadly frightened at not finding her.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;What&#39;s the matter, Hester?&#39; said Mrs. Stark, sharply. I don&#39;t&#10;know if Miss Furnivall had seen me, for, as I told you, she was&#10;very deaf, and she sat quite still, idly staring into the fire,&#10;with her hopeless face. &#39;I&#39;m only looking for my little Rosy Posy,&#39;&#10;replied I, still thinking that the child was there, and near me,&#10;though I could not see her.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Miss Rosamond is not here,&#39; said Mrs. Stark. &#39;She went away,&#10;more than an hour ago, to find Dorothy.&#39; And she, too, turned and&#10;went on looking into the fire.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;My heart sank at this, and I began to wish I had never left my&#10;darling. I went back to Dorothy and told her. James was gone out&#10;for the day, but she, and me, and Bessy took lights, and went up&#10;into the nursery first; and then we roamed over the great, large&#10;house, calling and entreating Miss Rosamond to come out of her&#10;hiding-place, and not frighten us to death in that way. But there&#10;was no answer; no sound.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Oh!&#39; said I, at last, &#39;can she have got into the east wing and&#10;hidden there?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But Dorothy said it was not possible, for that she herself had&#10;never been in there; that the doors were always locked, and my&#10;lord&#39;s steward had the keys, she believed; at any rate, neither she&#10;nor James had ever seen them: so I said I would go back, and see&#10;if, after all, she was not hidden in the drawing-room, unknown to&#10;the old ladies; and if I found her there, I said, I would whip her&#10;well for the fright she had given me; but I never meant to do it.&#10;Well, I went back to the west drawing-room, and I told Mrs. Stark&#10;we could not find her anywhere, and asked for leave to look all&#10;about the furniture there, for I thought now that she might have&#10;fallen asleep in some warm, hidden corner; but no! we looked &#8212; Miss&#10;Furnivall got up and looked, trembling all over &#8212; and she was&#10;nowhere there; then we set off again, every one in the house, and&#10;looked in all the places we had searched before, but we could not&#10;find her. Miss Furnivall shivered and shook so much, that Mrs.&#10;Stark took her back into the warm drawing-room; but not before they&#10;had made me promise to bring her to them when she was found.&#10;Well-a-day! I began to think she never would be found, when I&#10;bethought me to look into the great front court, all covered with&#10;snow. I was upstairs when I looked out; but, it was such clear&#10;moonlight, I could see, quite plain, two little footprints, which&#10;might be traced from the hall-door and round the corner of the east&#10;wing. I don&#39;t know how I got down, but I tugged open the great&#10;stiff hall-door, and, throwing the skirt of my gown over my head&#10;for a cloak, I ran out. I turned the east corner, and there a black&#10;shadow fell on the snow; but when I came again into the moonlight,&#10;there were the little foot-marks going up &#8212; up to the Fells. It was&#10;bitter cold; so cold, that the air almost took the skin off my face&#10;as I ran; but I ran on crying to think how my poor little darling&#10;must be perished and frightened. I was within sight of the&#10;holly-trees, when I saw a shepherd coming down the hill, bearing&#10;something in his arms wrapped in his maud. He shouted to me, and&#10;asked me if I had lost a bairn; and, when I could not speak for&#10;crying, he bore towards me, and I saw my wee bairnie, lying still,&#10;and white, and stiff in his arms, as if she had been dead. He told&#10;me he had been up the Fells to gather in his sheep, before the deep&#10;cold of night came on, and that under the holly-trees (black marks&#10;on the hill-side, where no other bush was for miles around) he had&#10;found my little lady &#8212; my lamb &#8212; my queen &#8212; my darling &#8212; stiff and&#10;cold in the terrible sleep which is frost-begotten. Oh! the joy and&#10;the tears of having her in my arms once again! for I would not let&#10;him carry her; but took her, maud and all, into my own arms, and&#10;held her near my own warm neck and heart, and felt the life&#10;stealing slowly back again into her little gentle limbs. But she&#10;was still insensible when we reached the hall, and I had no breath&#10;for speech. We went in by the kitchen-door.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Bring me the warming-pan,&#39; said I; and I carried her upstairs&#10;and began undressing her by the nursery fire, which Bessy had kept&#10;up. I called my little lammie all the sweet and playful names I&#10;could think of, &#8212; even while my eyes were blinded by my tears; and&#10;at last, oh! at length she opened her large blue eyes. Then I put&#10;her into her warm bed, and sent Dorothy down to tell Miss Furnivall&#10;that all was well; and I made up my mind to sit by my darling&#39;s&#10;bedside the live-long night. She fell away into a soft sleep as&#10;soon as her pretty head had touched the pillow, and I watched by&#10;her till morning light; when she wakened up bright and clear &#8212; or&#10;so I thought at first &#8212; and, my dears, so I think now.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She said, that she had fancied that she should like to go to&#10;Dorothy, for that both the old ladies were asleep, and it was very&#10;dull in the drawing-room; and that, as she was going through the&#10;west lobby, she saw the snow through the high window falling &#8212;&#10;falling &#8212; soft and steady; but she wanted to see it lying pretty&#10;and white on the ground; so she made her way into the great hall;&#10;and then, going to the window, she saw it bright and soft upon the&#10;drive; but while she stood there, she saw a little girl, not so old&#10;as she was, &#39;but so pretty,&#39; said my darling, &#39;and this little girl&#10;beckoned to me to come out; and oh, she was so pretty and so sweet,&#10;I could not choose but go.&#39; And then this other little girl had&#10;taken her by the hand, and side by side the two had gone round the&#10;east corner.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Now you are a naughty little girl, and telling stories,&#39; said&#10;I. &#39;What would your good mamma, that is in heaven, and never told a&#10;story in her life, say to her little Rosamond, if she heard her &#8212;&#10;and I daresay she does &#8212; telling stories!&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Indeed, Hester,&#39; sobbed out my child, &#39;I&#39;m telling you true.&#10;Indeed I am.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Don&#39;t tell me!&#39; said I, very stern. &#39;I tracked you by your&#10;foot-marks through the snow; there were only yours to be seen: and&#10;if you had had a little girl to go hand-in-hand with you up the&#10;hill, don&#39;t you think the footprints would have gone along with&#10;yours?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;I can&#39;t help it, dear, dear Hester,&#39; said she, crying, &#39;if they&#10;did not; I never looked at her feet, but she held my hand fast and&#10;tight in her little one, and it was very, very cold. She took me up&#10;the Fell-path, up to the holly-trees; and there I saw a lady&#10;weeping and crying; but when she saw me, she hushed her weeping,&#10;and smiled very proud and grand, and took me on her knee, and began&#10;to lull me to sleep; and that&#39;s all, Hester &#8212; but that is true; and&#10;my dear mamma knows it is,&#39; said she, crying. So I thought the&#10;child was in a fever, and pretended to believe her, as she went&#10;over her story &#8212; over and over again, and always the same. At last&#10;Dorothy knocked at the door with Miss Rosamond&#39;s breakfast; and she&#10;told me the old ladies were down in the eating parlour, and that&#10;they wanted to speak to me. They had both been into the&#10;night-nursery the evening before, but it was after Miss Rosamond&#10;was asleep; so they had only looked at her &#8212; not asked me any&#10;questions.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;I shall catch it,&#39; thought I to myself, as I went along the&#10;north gallery. &#39;And yet,&#39; I thought, taking courage, &#39;it was in&#10;their charge I left her; and it&#39;s they that&#39;s to blame for letting&#10;her steal away unknown and unwatched.&#39; So I went in boldly, and&#10;told my story. I told it all to Miss Furnivall, shouting it close&#10;to her ear; but when I came to the mention of the other little girl&#10;out in the snow, coaxing and tempting her out, and willing her up&#10;to the grand and beautiful lady by the holly-tree, she threw her&#10;arms up &#8212; her old and withered arms &#8212; and cried aloud, &#39;Oh! Heaven&#10;forgive! Have mercy!&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mrs. Stark took hold of her; roughly enough, I thought; but she&#10;was past Mrs. Stark&#39;s management, and spoke to me, in a kind of&#10;wild warning and authority.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Hester! keep her from that child! It will lure her to her&#10;death! That evil child! Tell her it is a wicked, naughty child.&#39;&#10;Then, Mrs. Stark hurried me out of the room; where, indeed, I was&#10;glad enough to go; but Miss Furnivall kept shrieking out, &#39;Oh, have&#10;mercy! Wilt Thou never forgive! It is many a long year ago &#8212; &#8212;&#10;&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I was very uneasy in my mind after that. I durst never leave&#10;Miss Rosamond, night or day, for fear lest she might slip off&#10;again, after some fancy or other; and all the more, because I&#10;thought I could make out that Miss Furnivall was crazy, from their&#10;odd ways about her; and I was afraid lest something of the same&#10;kind (which might be in the family, you know) hung over my darling.&#10;And the great frost never ceased all this time; and, whenever it&#10;was a more stormy night than usual, between the gusts, and through&#10;the wind, we heard the old lord playing on the great organ. But,&#10;old lord, or not, wherever Miss Rosamond went, there I followed;&#10;for my love for her, pretty, helpless orphan, was stronger than my&#10;fear for the grand and terrible sound. Besides, it rested with me&#10;to keep her cheerful and merry, as beseemed her age. So we played&#10;together, and wandered together, here and there, and everywhere;&#10;for I never dared to lose sight of her again in that large and&#10;rambling house. And so it happened, that one afternoon, not long&#10;before Christmas-day, we were playing together on the&#10;billiard-table in the great hall (not that we knew the right way of&#10;playing, but she liked to roll the smooth ivory balls with her&#10;pretty hands, and I liked to do whatever she did); and, by-and-by,&#10;without our noticing it, it grew dusk indoors, though it was still&#10;light in the open air, and I was thinking of taking her back into&#10;the nursery, when, all of a sudden, she cried out,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Look, Hester! look! there is my poor little girl out in the&#10;snow!&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I turned towards the long narrow windows, and there, sure&#10;enough, I saw a little girl, less than my Miss Rosamond &#8212; dressed&#10;all unfit to be out-of-doors such a bitter night &#8212; crying, and&#10;beating against the window-panes, as if she wanted to be let in.&#10;She seemed to sob and wail, till Miss Rosamond could bear it no&#10;longer, and was flying to the door to open it, when, all of a&#10;sudden, and close upon us, the great organ pealed out so loud and&#10;thundering, it fairly made me tremble; and all the more, when I&#10;remembered me that, even in the stillness of that dead-cold&#10;weather, I had heard no sound of little battering hands upon the&#10;windowglass, although the phantom child had seemed to put forth all&#10;its force; and, although I had seen it wail and cry, no faintest&#10;touch of sound had fallen upon my ears. Whether I remembered all&#10;this at the very moment, I do not know; the great organ sound had&#10;so stunned me into terror; but this I know, I caught up Miss&#10;Rosamond before she got the hall-door opened, and clutched her, and&#10;carried her away, kicking and screaming, into the large, bright&#10;kitchen, where Dorothy and Agnes were busy with their&#10;mince-pies.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;What is the matter with my sweet one?&#39; cried Dorothy, as I bore&#10;in Miss Rosamond, who was sobbing as if her heart would break.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;She won&#39;t let me open the door for my little girl to come in;&#10;and she&#39;ll die if she is out on the Fells all night. Cruel, naughty&#10;Hester,&#39; she said, slapping me; but she might have struck harder,&#10;for I had seen a look of ghastly terror on Dorothy&#39;s face, which&#10;made my very blood run cold.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Shut the back-kitchen door fast, and bolt it well,&#39; said she to&#10;Agnes. She said no more; she gave me raisins and almonds to quiet&#10;Miss Rosamond; but she sobbed about the little girl in the snow,&#10;and would not touch any of the good things. I was thankful when she&#10;cried herself to sleep in bed. Then I stole down to the kitchen,&#10;and told Dorothy I had made up my mind. I would carry my darling&#10;back to my father&#39;s house in Applethwaite; where, if we lived&#10;humbly, we lived at peace. I said I had been frightened enough with&#10;the old lord&#39;s organ-playing; but now that I had seen for myself&#10;this little moaning child, all decked out as no child in the&#10;neighbourhood could be, beating and battering to get in, yet always&#10;without any sound or noise &#8212; with the dark wound on its right&#10;shoulder; and that Miss Rosamond had known it again for the phantom&#10;that had nearly lured her to her death (which Dorothy knew was&#10;true); I would stand it no longer.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I saw Dorothy change colour once or twice. When I had done, she&#10;told me she did not think I could take Miss Rosamond with me, for&#10;that she was my lord&#39;s ward, and I had no right over her; and she&#10;asked me would I leave the child that I was so fond of just for&#10;sounds and sights that could do me no harm; and that they had all&#10;had to get used to in their turns? I was all in a hot, trembling&#10;passion; and I said it was very well for her to talk; that knew&#10;what these sights and noises betokened, and that had, perhaps, had&#10;something to do with the spectre child while it was alive. And I&#10;taunted her so, that she told me all she knew at last; and then I&#10;wished I had never been told, for it only made me more afraid than&#10;ever.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She said she had heard the tale from old neighbours that were&#10;alive when she was first married; when folks used to come to the&#10;hall sometimes, before it had got such a bad name on the country&#10;side: it might not be true, or it might, what she had been&#10;told.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The old lord was Miss Furnivall&#39;s father &#8212; Miss Grace, as&#10;Dorothy called her, for Miss Maude was the elder, and Miss&#10;Furnivall by rights. The old lord was eaten up with pride. Such a&#10;proud man was never seen or heard of; and his daughters were like&#10;him. No one was good enough to wed them, although they had choice&#10;enough; for they were the great beauties of their day, as I had&#10;seen by their portraits, where they hung in the state drawing-room.&#10;But, as the old saying is, &#39;Pride will have a fall;&#39; and these two&#10;haughty beauties fell in love with the same man, and he no better&#10;than a foreign musician, whom their father had down from London to&#10;play music with him at the Manor House. For, above all things, next&#10;to his pride, the old lord loved music. He could play on nearly&#10;every instrument that ever was heard of, and it was a strange thing&#10;it did not soften him; but he was a fierce dour old man, and had&#10;broken his poor wife&#39;s heart with his cruelty, they said. He was&#10;mad after music, and would pay any money for it. So he got this&#10;foreigner to come; who made such beautiful music, that they said&#10;the very birds on the trees stopped their singing to listen. And,&#10;by degrees, this foreign gentleman got such a hold over the old&#10;lord, that nothing would serve him but that he must come every&#10;year; and it was he that had the great organ brought from Holland,&#10;and built up in the hall, where it stood now. He taught the old&#10;lord to play on it; but many and many a time, when Lord Furnivall&#10;was thinking of nothing but his fine organ, and his finer music,&#10;the dark foreigner was walking abroad in the woods with one of the&#10;young ladies; now Miss Maude, and then Miss Grace.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Miss Maude won the day and carried off the prize, such as it&#10;was; and he and she were married, all unknown to any one; and&#10;before he made his next yearly visit, she had been confined of a&#10;little girl at a farm-house on the Moors, while her father and Miss&#10;Grace thought she was away at Doncaster Races. But though she was a&#10;wife and a mother, she was not a bit softened, but as haughty and&#10;as passionate as ever; and perhaps more so, for she was jealous of&#10;Miss Grace, to whom her foreign husband paid a deal of court &#8212; by&#10;way of blinding her &#8212; as he told his wife. But Miss Grace triumphed&#10;over Miss Maude, and Miss Maude grew fiercer and fiercer, both with&#10;her husband and with her sister; and the former &#8212; who could easily&#10;shake off what was disagreeable, and hide himself in foreign&#10;countries &#8212; went away a month before his usual time that summer,&#10;and half-threatened that he would never come back again. Meanwhile,&#10;the little girl was left at the farm-house, and her mother used to&#10;have her horse saddled and gallop wildly over the hills to see her&#10;once every week, at the very least; for where she loved she loved,&#10;and where she hated she hated. And the old lord went on playing &#8212;&#10;playing on his organ; and the servants thought the sweet music he&#10;made had soothed down his awful temper, of which (Dorothy said)&#10;some terrible tales could be told. He grew infirm too, and had to&#10;walk with a crutch; and his son &#8212; that was the present Lord&#10;Furnivall&#39;s father &#8212; was with the army in America, and the other&#10;son at sea; so Miss Maude had it pretty much her own way, and she&#10;and Miss Grace grew colder and bitterer to each other every day;&#10;till at last they hardly ever spoke, except when the old lord was&#10;by. The foreign musician came again the next summer, but it was for&#10;the last time; for they led him such a life with their jealousy and&#10;their passions, that he grew weary, and went away, and never was&#10;heard of again. And Miss Maude, who had always meant to have her&#10;marriage acknowledged when her father should be dead, was left now&#10;a deserted wife, whom nobody knew to have been married, with a&#10;child that she dared not own, although she loved it to distraction;&#10;living with a father whom she feared, and a sister whom she hated.&#10;When the next summer passed over, and the dark foreigner never&#10;came, both Miss Maude and Miss Grace grew gloomy and sad; they had&#10;a haggard look about them, though they looked handsome as ever.&#10;But, by-and-by, Maude brightened; for her father grew more and more&#10;infirm, and more than ever carried away by his music; and she and&#10;Miss Grace lived almost entirely apart, having separate rooms, the&#10;one on the west side, Miss Maude on the east &#8212; those very rooms&#10;which were now shut up. So she thought she might have her little&#10;girl with her, and no one need ever know except those who dared not&#10;speak about it, and were bound to believe that it was, as she said,&#10;a cottager&#39;s child she had taken a fancy to. All this, Dorothy&#10;said, was pretty well known; but what came afterwards no one knew,&#10;except Miss Grace and Mrs. Stark, who was even then her maid, and&#10;much more of a friend to her than ever her sister had been. But the&#10;servants supposed, from words that were dropped, that Miss Maude&#10;had triumphed over Miss Grace, and told her that all the time the&#10;dark foreigner had been mocking her with pretended love &#8212; he was&#10;her own husband. The colour left Miss Grace&#39;s cheek and lips that&#10;very day for ever, and she was heard to say many a time that sooner&#10;or later she would have her revenge; and Mrs. Stark was for ever&#10;spying about the east rooms.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;One fearful night, just after the New Year had come in, when the&#10;snow was lying thick and deep; and the flakes were still falling &#8212;&#10;fast enough to blind any one who might be out and abroad &#8212; there&#10;was a great and violent noise heard, and the old lord&#39;s voice above&#10;all, cursing and swearing awfully, and the cries of a little child,&#10;and the proud defiance of a fierce woman, and the sound of a blow,&#10;and a dead stillness, and moans and wailings dying away on the&#10;hill-side! Then the old lord summoned all his servants, and told&#10;them, with terrible oaths, and words more terrible, that his&#10;daughter had disgraced herself, and that he had turned her out of&#10;doors &#8212; her, and her child &#8212; and that if ever they gave her help,&#10;or food, or shelter, he prayed that they might never enter heaven.&#10;And, all the while, Miss Grace stood by him, white and still as any&#10;stone; and, when he had ended, she heaved a great sigh, as much as&#10;to say her work was done, and her end was accomplished. But the old&#10;lord never touched his organ again, and died within the year; and&#10;no wonder! for, on the morrow of that wild and fearful night, the&#10;shepherds, coming down the Fell side, found Miss Maude sitting, all&#10;crazy and smiling, under the holly-trees, nursing a dead child,&#10;with a terrible mark on its right shoulder. &#39;But that was not what&#10;killed it,&#39; said Dorothy: &#39;it was the frost and the cold. Every&#10;wild creature was in its hole, and every beast in its fold, while&#10;the child and its mother were turned out to wander on the Fells!&#10;And now you know all! and I wonder if you are less frightened&#10;now?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I was more frightened than ever; but I said I was not. I wished&#10;Miss Rosamond and myself well out of that dreadful house for ever;&#10;but I would not leave her, and I dared not take her away. But oh,&#10;how I watched her, and guarded her! We bolted the doors, and shut&#10;the window-shutters fast, an hour or more before dark, rather than&#10;leave them open five minutes too late. But my little lady still&#10;heard the weird child crying and mourning; and not all we could do&#10;or say could keep her from wanting to go to her, and let her in&#10;from the cruel wind and the snow. All this time I kept away from&#10;Miss Furnivall and Mrs. Stark, as much as ever I could; for I&#10;feared them &#8212; I knew no good could be about them, with their grey,&#10;hard faces, and their dreamy eyes, looking back into the ghastly&#10;years that were gone. But, even in my fear, I had a kind of pity&#10;for Miss Furnivall, at least. Those gone down to the pit can hardly&#10;have a more hopeless look than that which was ever on her face. At&#10;last I even got so sorry for her &#8212; who never said a word but what&#10;was quite forced from her &#8212; that I prayed for her; and I taught&#10;Miss Rosamond to pray for one who had done a deadly sin; but often&#10;when she came to those words, she would listen, and start up from&#10;her knees, and say, &#39;I hear my little girl plaining and crying very&#10;sad &#8212; oh, let her in, or she will die!&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;One night &#8212; just after New Year&#39;s Day had come at last, and the&#10;long winter had taken a turn, as I hoped &#8212; I heard the west&#10;drawing-room bell ring three times, which was the signal for me. I&#10;would not leave Miss Rosamond alone, for all she was asleep &#8212; for&#10;the old lord had been playing wilder than ever &#8212; and I feared lest&#10;my darling should waken to hear the spectre child; see her, I knew&#10;she could not. I had fastened the windows too well for that. So I&#10;took her out of her bed, and wrapped her up in such outer clothes&#10;as were most handy, and carried her down to the drawing-room, where&#10;the old ladies sat at their tapestry-work as usual. They looked up&#10;when I came in, and Mrs. Stark asked, quite astounded, &#39;Why did I&#10;bring Miss Rosamond there, out of her warm bed?&#39; I had begun to&#10;whisper, &#39;Because I was afraid of her being tempted out while I was&#10;away, by the wild child in the snow,&#39; when she stopped me short&#10;(with a glance at Miss Furnivall), and said Miss Furnivall wanted&#10;me to undo some work she had done wrong, and which neither of them&#10;could see to unpick. So I laid my pretty dear on the sofa, and sat&#10;down on a stool by them, and hardened my heart against them, as I&#10;heard the wind rising and howling.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Miss Rosamond slept on sound, for all the wind blew so Miss&#10;Furnivall said never a word, nor looked round when the gusts shook&#10;the windows. All at once she started up to her full height, and put&#10;up one hand, as if to bid us to listen.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;I hear voices!&#39; said she. &#39;I hear terrible screams &#8212; I hear my&#10;father&#39;s voice!&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Just at that moment my darling wakened with a sudden start: &#39;My&#10;little girl is crying, oh, how she is crying!&#39; and she tried to get&#10;up and go to her, but she got her feet entangled in the blanket,&#10;and I caught her up; for my flesh had begun to creep at these&#10;noises, which they heard while we could catch no sound. In a minute&#10;or two the noises came, and gathered fast, and filled our ears; we,&#10;too, heard voices and screams, and no longer heard the winter&#39;s&#10;wind that raged abroad. Mrs. Stark looked at me, and I at her, but&#10;we dared not speak. Suddenly Miss Furnivall went towards the door,&#10;out into the ante-room, through the west lobby, and opened the door&#10;into the great hall. Mrs. Stark followed, and I durst not be left,&#10;though my heart almost stopped beating for fear. I wrapped my&#10;darling tight in my arms, and went out with them. In the hall the&#10;screams were louder than ever; they seemed to come from the east&#10;wing &#8212; nearer and nearer &#8212; close on the other side of the locked-up&#10;doors &#8212; close behind them. Then I noticed that the great bronze&#10;chandelier seemed all alight, though the hall was dim, and that a&#10;fire was blazing in the vast hearth-place, though it gave no heat;&#10;and I shuddered up with terror, and folded my darling closer to me.&#10;But as I did so the east door shook, and she, suddenly struggling&#10;to get free from me, cried, &#39;Hester! I must go. My little girl is&#10;there! I hear her; she is coming! Hester, I must go!&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I held her tight with all my strength; with a set will, I held&#10;her. If I had died, my hands would have grasped her still, I was so&#10;resolved in my mind. Miss Furnivall stood listening, and paid no&#10;regard to my darling, who had got down to the ground, and whom I,&#10;upon my knees now, was holding with both my arms clasped round her&#10;neck; she still striving and crying to get free.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;All at once, the east door gave way with a thundering crash, as&#10;if torn open in a violent passion, and there came into that broad&#10;and mysterious light, the figure of a tall old man, with grey hair&#10;and gleaming eyes. He drove before him, with many a relentless&#10;gesture of abhorrence, a stern and beautiful woman, with a little&#10;child clinging to her dress.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Oh, Hester! Hester!&#39; cried Miss Rosamond; &#39;it&#39;s the lady! the&#10;lady below the holly-trees; and my little girl is with her. Hester!&#10;Hester! let me go to her; they are drawing me to them. I feel them&#10;&#8212; I feel them. I must go!&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Again she was almost convulsed by her efforts to get away; but I&#10;held her tighter and tighter, till I feared I should do her a hurt;&#10;but rather that than let her go towards those terrible phantoms.&#10;They passed along towards the great hall-door, where the winds&#10;howled and ravened for their prey; but before they reached that,&#10;the lady turned; and I could see that she defied the old man with a&#10;fierce and proud defiance; but then she quailed &#8212; and then she&#10;threw up her arms wildly and piteously to save her child &#8212; her&#10;little child &#8212; from a blow from his uplifted crutch.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And Miss Rosamond was torn as by a power stronger than mine and&#10;writhed in my arms, and sobbed (for by this time the poor darling&#10;was growing faint).&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;They want me to go with them on to the Fells &#8212; they are drawing&#10;me to them. Oh, my little girl! I would come, but cruel, wicked&#10;Hester holds me very tight.&#39; But when she saw the uplifted crutch,&#10;she swooned away, and I thanked God for it. Just at this moment &#8212;&#10;when the tall old man, his hair streaming as in the blast of a&#10;furnace, was going to strike the little shrinking child &#8212; Miss&#10;Furnivall, the old woman by my side, cried out, &#39;Oh father! father!&#10;spare the little innocent child!&#39; But just then I saw &#8212; we all saw&#10;&#8212; another phantom shape itself, and grow clear out of the blue and&#10;misty light that filled the hall; we had not seen her till now, for&#10;it was another lady who stood by the old man, with a look of&#10;relentless hate and triumphant scorn. That figure was very&#10;beautiful to look upon, with a soft, white hat drawn down over the&#10;proud brows, and a red and curling lip. It was dressed in an open&#10;robe of blue satin. I had seen that figure before. It was the&#10;likeness of Miss Furnivall in her youth; and the terrible phantoms&#10;moved on, regardless of old Miss Furnivall&#39;s wild entreaty, &#8212; and&#10;the uplifted crutch fell on the right shoulder of the little child,&#10;and the younger sister looked on, stony, and deadly serene. But at&#10;that moment, the dim lights, and the fire that gave no heat, went&#10;out of themselves, and Miss Furnivall lay at our feet stricken down&#10;by the palsy &#8212; death-stricken.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Yes! she was carried to her bed that night never to rise again.&#10;She lay with her face to the wall, muttering low, but muttering&#10;always: &#39;Alas! alas! what is done in youth can never be undone in&#10;age! What is done in youth can never be undone in age!&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 12, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/3335')

I shall not tell you of my troubles and&#10;adventures in this research; you are not worthy to hear of them;&#10;but something so curious befell me one evening last August, that if&#10;I had not been perfectly certain I was wide awake, I might have&#10;taken it for a dream.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For the purpose I have named, it was necessary that I should&#10;make Tours my head-quarters for a time. I had traced descendants of&#10;the Calvin family out of Normandy into the centre of France; but I&#10;found it was necessary to have a kind of permission from the bishop&#10;of the diocese before I could see certain family papers, which had&#10;fallen into the possession of the Church; and, as I had several&#10;English friends at Tours, I awaited the answer to my request to&#10;Monseigneur de &#8212; &#8212; , at that town. I was ready to accept any&#10;invitation; but I received very few; and was sometimes a little at&#10;a loss what to do with my evenings. The table d&#39;h&#244;te was at five&#10;o&#39;clock; I did not wish to go to the expense of a private&#10;sitting-room, disliked the dinnery atmosphere of the salle &#224;&#10;manger, could not play either at pool or billiards, and the aspect&#10;of my fellow guests was unprepossessing enough to make me unwilling&#10;to enter into any t&#234;te-&#224;-t&#234;te gamblings with them. So I usually&#10;rose from table early, and tried to make the most of the remaining&#10;light of the August evenings in walking briskly off to explore the&#10;surrounding country; the middle of the day was too hot for this&#10;purpose, and better employed in lounging on a bench in the&#10;Boulevards, lazily listening to the distant band, and noticing with&#10;equal laziness the faces and figures of the women who passed&#10;by.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;One Thursday evening, the 18th of August it was, I think, I had&#10;gone further than usual in my walk, and I found that it was later&#10;than I had imagined when I paused to turn back. I fancied I could&#10;make a round; I had enough notion of the direction in which I was,&#10;to see that by turning up a narrow straight lane to my left I&#10;should shorten my way back to Tours. And so I believe I should have&#10;done, could I have found an outlet at the right place, but&#10;field-paths are almost unknown in that part of France, and my lane,&#10;stiff and straight as any street, and marked into terribly&#10;vanishing perspective by the regular row of poplars on each side,&#10;seemed interminable. Of course night came on, and I was in&#10;darkness. In England I might have had a chance of seeing a light in&#10;some cottage only a field or two off, and asking my way from the&#10;inhabitants; but here I could see no such welcome sight; indeed, I&#10;believe French peasants go to bed with the summer daylight, so if&#10;there were any habitations in the neighbourhood I never saw them.&#10;At last &#8212; I believe I must have walked two hours in the darkness, &#8212;&#10;I saw the dusky outline of a wood on one side of the weariful lane,&#10;and, impatiently careless of all forest laws and penalties for&#10;trespassers, I made my way to it, thinking that if the worst came&#10;to the worst, I could find some covert &#8212; some shelter where I could&#10;lie down and rest, until the morning light gave me a chance of&#10;finding my way back to Tours. But the plantation, on the outskirts&#10;of what appeared to me a dense wood, was of young trees, too&#10;closely planted to be more than slender stems growing up to a good&#10;height, with scanty foliage on their summits. On I went towards the&#10;thicker forest, and once there I slackened my pace, and began to&#10;look about me for a good lair. I was as dainty as Lochiel&#39;s&#10;grandchild, who made his grandsire indignant at the luxury of his&#10;pillow of snow: this brake was too full of brambles, that felt damp&#10;with dew; there was no hurry, since I had given up all hope of&#10;passing the night between four walls; and I went leisurely groping&#10;about, and trusting that there were no wolves to be poked up out of&#10;their summer drowsiness by my stick, when all at once I saw a&#10;ch&#226;teau before me, not a quarter of a mile off, at the end of what&#10;seemed to be an ancient avenue (now overgrown and irregular), which&#10;I happened to be crossing, when I looked to my right, and saw the&#10;welcome sight. Large, stately, and dark was its outline against the&#10;dusky night-sky; there were pepper-boxes and tourelles and what-not&#10;fantastically going up into the dim starlight. And more to the&#10;purpose still, though I could not see the details of the building&#10;that I was now facing, it was plain enough that there were lights&#10;in many windows, as if some great entertainment was going on.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;They are hospitable people, at any rate,&#39; thought I. &#39;Perhaps&#10;they will give me a bed. I don&#39;t suppose French propri&#233;taires have&#10;traps and horses quite as plentiful as English gentlemen; but they&#10;are evidently having a large party, and some of their guests may be&#10;from Tours, and will give me a cast back to the Lion d&#39;Or. I am not&#10;proud, and I am dog-tired. I am not above hanging on behind, if&#10;need be.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So, putting a little briskness and spirit into my walk, I went&#10;up to the door, which was standing open, most hospitably, and&#10;showing a large lighted hall, all hung round with spoils of the&#10;chase, armour, &#38;amp;c., the details of which I had not time to&#10;notice, for the instant I stood on the threshold a huge porter&#10;appeared, in a strange, old-fashioned dress, a kind of livery which&#10;well befitted the general appearance of the house. He asked me, in&#10;French (so curiously pronounced that I thought I had hit upon a new&#10;kind of patois), my name, and whence I came. I thought he would not&#10;be much the wiser, still it was but civil to give it before I made&#10;my request for assistance; so, in reply, I said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;My name is Whittingham &#8212; Richard Whittingham, an English&#10;gentleman, staying at &#8212; &#8212; .&#39; To my infinite surprise, a light of&#10;pleased intelligence came over the giant&#39;s face; he made me a low&#10;bow, and said (still in the same curious dialect) that I was&#10;welcome, that I was long expected.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Long expected!&#39; What could the fellow mean? Had I stumbled on a&#10;nest of relations by John Calvin&#39;s side, who had heard of my&#10;genealogical inquiries, and were gratified and interested by them?&#10;But I was too much pleased to be under shelter for the night to&#10;think it necessary to account for my agreeable reception before I&#10;enjoyed it. Just as he was opening the great heavy battants of the&#10;door that led from the hall to the interior, he turned round and&#10;said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Apparently Monsieur le G&#233;anquilleur is not come with you.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;No! I am all alone; I have lost my way,&#39; &#8212; and I was going on&#10;with my explanation, when he, as if quite indifferent to it, led&#10;the way up a great stone staircase, as wide as many rooms, and&#10;having on each landing-place massive iron wickets, in a heavy&#10;framework; these the porter unlocked with the solemn slowness of&#10;age. Indeed, a strange, mysterious awe of the centuries that had&#10;passed away since this ch&#226;teau was built, came over me as I waited&#10;for the turning of the ponderous keys in the ancient locks. I could&#10;almost have fancied that I heard a mighty rushing murmur (like the&#10;ceaseless sound of a distant sea, ebbing and flowing for ever and&#10;for ever), coming forth from the great vacant galleries that opened&#10;out on each side of the broad staircase, and were to be dimly&#10;perceived in the darkness above us. It was as if the voices of&#10;generations of men yet echoed and eddied in the silent air. It was&#10;strange, too, that my friend the porter going before me,&#10;ponderously infirm, with his feeble old hands striving in vain to&#10;keep the tall flambeau he held steadily before him, &#8212; strange, I&#10;say, that he was the only domestic I saw in the vast halls and&#10;passages, or met with on the grand staircase. At length we stood&#10;before the gilded doors that led into the saloon where the family &#8212;&#10;or it might be the company, so great was the buzz of voices &#8212; was&#10;assembled. I would have remonstrated when I found he was going to&#10;introduce me, dusty and travel-smeared, in a morning costume that&#10;was not even my best, into this grand salon, with nobody knew how&#10;many ladies and gentlemen assembled; but the obstinate old man was&#10;evidently bent upon taking me straight to his master, and paid no&#10;heed to my words.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The doors flew open, and I was ushered into a saloon curiously&#10;full of pale light, which did not culminate on any spot, nor&#10;proceed from any centre, nor flicker with any motion of the air,&#10;but filled every nook and corner, making all things deliciously&#10;distinct; different from our light of gas or candle, as is the&#10;difference between a clear southern atmosphere and that of our&#10;misty England.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At the first moment, my arrival excited no attention, the&#10;apartment was so full of people, all intent on their own&#10;conversation. But my friend the porter went up to a handsome lady&#10;of middle age, richly attired in that antique manner which fashion&#10;has brought round again of late years, and, waiting first in an&#10;attitude of deep respect till her attention fell upon him, told her&#10;my name and something about me, as far as I could guess from the&#10;gestures of the one and the sudden glance of the eye of the&#10;other.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She immediately came towards me with the most friendly actions&#10;of greeting, even before she had advanced near enough to speak.&#10;Then, &#8212; and was it not strange? &#8212; her words and accent were that of&#10;the commonest peasant of the country. Yet she herself looked&#10;highbred, and would have been dignified had she been a shade less&#10;restless, had her countenance worn a little less lively and&#10;inquisitive expression. I had been poking a good deal about the old&#10;parts of Tours, and had had to understand the dialect of the people&#10;who dwelt in the March&#233; au Vendredi and similar places, or I really&#10;should not have understood my handsome hostess, as she offered to&#10;present me to her husband, a henpecked, gentlemanly man, who was&#10;more quaintly attired than she in the very extreme of that style of&#10;dress. I thought to myself that in France, as in England, it is the&#10;provincials who carry fashion to such an excess as to become&#10;ridiculous.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;However, he spoke (still in the patois) of his pleasure in&#10;making my acquaintance, and led me to a strange uneasy easy-chair,&#10;much of a piece with the rest of the furniture, which might have&#10;taken its place without any anachronism by the side of that in the&#10;H&#244;tel Cluny. Then again began the clatter of French voices, which&#10;my arrival had for an instant interrupted, and I had leisure to&#10;look about me. Opposite to me sat a very sweet-looking lady, who&#10;must have been a great beauty in her youth, I should think, and&#10;would be charming in old age, from the sweetness of her&#10;countenance. She was, however, extremely fat, and on seeing her&#10;feet laid up before her on a cushion, I at once perceived that they&#10;were so swollen as to render her incapable of walking, which&#10;probably brought on her excessive embonpoint. Her hands were plump&#10;and small, but rather coarse-grained in texture, not quite so clean&#10;as they might have been, and altogether not so aristocratic-looking&#10;as the charming face. Her dress was of superb black velvet,&#10;ermine-trimmed, with diamonds thrown all abroad over it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Not far from her stood the least little man I had ever seen; of&#10;such admirable proportions no one could call him a dwarf, because&#10;with that word we usually associate something of deformity; but yet&#10;with an elfin look of shrewd, hard, worldly wisdom in his face that&#10;marred the impression which his delicate regular little features&#10;would otherwise have conveyed. Indeed, I do not think he was quite&#10;of equal rank with the rest of the company, for his dress was&#10;inappropriate to the occasion (and he apparently was an invited,&#10;while I was an involuntary guest); and one or two of his gestures&#10;and actions were more like the tricks of an uneducated rustic than&#10;anything else. To explain what I mean: his boots had evidently seen&#10;much service, and had been re-topped, re-heeled, re-soled to the&#10;extent of cobbler&#39;s powers. Why should he have come in them if they&#10;were not his best &#8212; his only pair? And what can be more ungenteel&#10;than poverty? Then again he had an uneasy trick of putting his hand&#10;up to his throat, as if he expected to find something the matter&#10;with it; and he had the awkward habit &#8212; which I do not think he&#10;could have copied from Dr. Johnson, because most probably he had&#10;never heard of him &#8212; of trying always to retrace his steps on the&#10;exact boards on which he had trodden to arrive at any particular&#10;part of the room. Besides, to settle the question, I once heard him&#10;addressed as Monsieur Poucet, without any aristocratic &#39;de&#39; for a&#10;prefix; and nearly every one else in the room was a marquis, at any&#10;rate.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I say, &#39;nearly every one;&#39; for some strange people had the&#10;entr&#233;e; unless, indeed, they were, like me, benighted. One of the&#10;guests I should have taken for a servant, but for the extraordinary&#10;influence he seemed to have over the man I took for his master, and&#10;who never did anything without, apparently, being urged thereto by&#10;this follower. The master, magnificently dressed, but ill at ease&#10;in his clothes as if they had been made for some one else, was a&#10;weak-looking, handsome man, continually sauntering about, and I&#10;almost guessed an object of suspicion to some of the gentlemen&#10;present, which, perhaps, drove him on the companionship of his&#10;follower, who was dressed something in the style of an ambassador&#39;s&#10;chasseur; yet it was not a chasseur&#39;s dress after all; it was&#10;something more thoroughly old-world; boots half way up his&#10;ridiculously small legs, which clattered as he walked along, as if&#10;they were too large for his little feet; and a great quantity of&#10;grey fur, as trimming to coat, court mantle, boots, cap &#8212;&#10;everything. You know the way in which certain countenances remind&#10;you perpetually of some animal, be it bird or beast! Well, this&#10;chasseur (as I will call him for want of a better name) was&#10;exceedingly like the great Tom-cat that you have seen so often in&#10;my chambers, and laughed at almost as often for his uncanny gravity&#10;of demeanour. Grey whiskers has my Tom &#8212; grey whiskers had the&#10;chasseur: grey hair overshadows the upper lip of my Tom &#8212; grey&#10;mustachios hid that of the chasseur. The pupils of Tom&#39;s eyes&#10;dilate and contract as I had thought cats&#39; pupils only could do,&#10;until I saw those of the chasseur. To be sure, canny as Tom is, the&#10;chasseur had the advantage in the more intelligent expression. He&#10;seemed to have obtained most complete sway over his master or&#10;patron, whose looks he watched, and whose steps he followed, with a&#10;kind of distrustful interest that puzzled me greatly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There were several other groups in the more distant part of the&#10;saloon, all of the stately old school, all grand and noble, I&#10;conjectured from their bearing. They seemed perfectly well&#10;acquainted with each other, as if they were in the habit of&#10;meeting. But I was interrupted in my observations by the tiny&#10;little gentleman on the opposite side of the room coming across to&#10;take a place beside me. It is no difficult matter to a Frenchman to&#10;slide into conversation, and so gracefully did my pigmy friend keep&#10;up the character of the nation, that we were almost confidential&#10;before ten minutes had elapsed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now I was quite aware that the welcome which all had extended to&#10;me, from the porter up to the vivacious lady and meek lord of the&#10;castle, was intended for some other person. But it required either&#10;a degree of moral courage, of which I cannot boast, or the&#10;self-reliance and conversational powers of a bolder and cleverer&#10;man than I, to undeceive people who had fallen into so fortunate a&#10;mistake for me. Yet the little man by my side insinuated himself so&#10;much into my confidence, that I had half a mind to tell him of my&#10;exact situation, and to turn him into a friend and an ally.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Madame is perceptibly growing older,&#39; said he, in the midst of&#10;my perplexity, glancing at our hostess.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Madame is still a very fine woman,&#39; replied I.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Now, is it not strange,&#39; continued he, lowering his voice, &#39;how&#10;women almost invariably praise the absent, or departed, as if they&#10;were angels of light while as for the present, or the living&#39; &#8212;&#10;here he shrugged up his little shoulders, and made an expressive&#10;pause. &#39;Would you believe it! Madame is always praising her late&#10;husband to monsieur&#39;s face; till, in fact, we guests are quite&#10;perplexed how to look: for, you know, the late M. de Retz&#39;s&#10;character was quite notorious, &#8212; everybody has heard of him.&#39; All&#10;the world of Touraine, thought I, but I made an assenting&#10;noise.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At this instant, monsieur our host came up to me, and with a&#10;civil look of tender interest (such as some people put on when they&#10;inquire after your mother, about whom they do not care one straw),&#10;asked if I had heard lately how my cat was? &#39;How my cat was!&#39; What&#10;could the man mean? My cat! Could he mean the tailless Tom, born in&#10;the Isle of Man, and now supposed to be keeping guard against the&#10;incursions of rats and mice into my chambers in London? Tom is, as&#10;you know, on pretty good terms with some of my friends, using their&#10;legs for rubbing-posts without scruple, and highly esteemed by them&#10;for his gravity of demeanour, and wise manner of winking his eyes.&#10;But could his fame have reached across the Channel? However, an&#10;answer must be returned to the inquiry, as monsieur&#39;s face was bent&#10;down to mine with a look of polite anxiety; so I, in my turn,&#10;assumed an expression of gratitude, and assured him that, to the&#10;best of my belief, my cat was in remarkably good health.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;And the climate agrees with her?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Perfectly,&#39; said I, in a maze of wonder at this deep solicitude&#10;in a tailless cat who had lost one foot and half an ear in some&#10;cruel trap. My host smiled a sweet smile, and, addressing a few&#10;words to my little neighbour, passed on.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;How wearisome those aristocrats are!&#39; quoth my neighbour, with&#10;a slight sneer. &#39;Monsieur&#39;s conversation rarely extends to more&#10;than two sentences to any one. By that time his faculties are&#10;exhausted, and he needs the refreshment of silence. You and I,&#10;monsieur, are, at any rate, indebted to our own wits for our rise&#10;in the world!&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Here again I was bewildered! As you know, I am rather proud of&#10;my descent from families which, if not noble themselves, are allied&#10;to nobility, &#8212; and as to my &#39;rise in the world&#39; &#8212; if I had risen,&#10;it would have been rather for balloon-like qualities than for&#10;mother-wit, to being unencumbered with heavy ballast either in my&#10;head or my pockets. However, it was my cue to agree: so I smiled&#10;again.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;For my part,&#39; said he, &#39;if a man does not stick at trifles, if&#10;he knows how to judiciously add to, or withhold facts, and is not&#10;sentimental in his parade of humanity, he is sure to do well; sure&#10;to affix a de or von to his name, and end his days in comfort.&#10;There is an example of what I am saying&#39; &#8212; and he glanced furtively&#10;at the weak-looking master of the sharp, intelligent servant, whom&#10;I have called the chasseur.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Monsieur le Marquis would never have been anything but a&#10;miller&#39;s son, if it had not been for the talents of his servant. Of&#10;course you know his antecedents?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I was going to make some remarks on the changes in the order of&#10;the peerage since the days of Louis XVI. &#8212; going, in fact, to be&#10;very sensible and historical &#8212; when there was a slight commotion&#10;among the people at the other end of the room. Lacqueys in quaint&#10;liveries must have come in from behind the tapestry, I suppose (for&#10;I never saw them enter, though I sate right opposite to the doors),&#10;and were handing about the slight beverages and slighter viands&#10;which are considered sufficient refreshments, but which looked&#10;rather meagre to my hungry appetite. These footmen were standing&#10;solemnly opposite to a lady, &#8212; beautiful, splendid as the dawn, but&#10;&#8212; sound asleep in a magnificent settee. A gentleman who showed so&#10;much irritation at her ill-timed slumbers, that I think he must&#10;have been her husband, was trying to awaken her with actions not&#10;far removed from shakings. All in vain; she was quite unconscious&#10;of his annoyance, or the smiles of the company, or the automatic&#10;solemnity of the waiting footman, or the perplexed anxiety of&#10;monsieur and madame.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;My little friend sat down with a sneer, as if his curiosity was&#10;quenched in contempt.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Moralists would make an infinity of wise remarks on that&#10;scene,&#39; said he. &#39;In the first place, note the ridiculous position&#10;into which their superstitious reverence for rank and title puts&#10;all these people. Because monsieur is a reigning prince over some&#10;minute principality, the exact situation of which no one has as yet&#10;discovered, no one must venture to take their glass of eau sucr&#233;&#10;till Madame la Princesse awakens; and, judging from past&#10;experience, those poor lacqueys may have to stand for a century&#10;before that happens. Next &#8212; always speaking as a moralist, you will&#10;observe &#8212; note how difficult it is to break off bad habits acquired&#10;in youth!&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Just then the prince succeeded, by what means I did not see, in&#10;awaking the beautiful sleeper. But at first she did not remember&#10;where she was, and looking up at her husband with loving eyes, she&#10;smiled and said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Is it you, my prince?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But he was too conscious of the suppressed amusement of the&#10;spectators and his own consequent annoyance, to be reciprocally&#10;tender, and turned away with some little French expression, best&#10;rendered into English by &#39;Pooh, pooh, my dear!&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;After I had had a glass of delicious wine of some unknown&#10;quality, my courage was in rather better plight than before, and I&#10;told my cynical little neighbour &#8212; whom I must say I was beginning&#10;to dislike &#8212; that I had lost my way in the wood, and had arrived at&#10;the ch&#226;teau quite by mistake.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He seemed mightily amused at my story; said that the same thing&#10;had happened to himself more than once; and told me that I had&#10;better luck than he had on one of these occasions, when, from his&#10;account, he must have been in considerable danger of his life. He&#10;ended his story by making me admire his boots, which he said he&#10;still wore, patched though they were, and all their excellent&#10;quality lost by patching, because they were of such a first-rate&#10;make for long pedestrian excursions. &#39;Though, indeed,&#39; he wound up&#10;by saying, &#39;the new fashion of railroads would seem to supersede&#10;the necessity for this description of boots.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When I consulted him as to whether I ought to make myself known&#10;to my host and hostess as a benighted traveller, instead of the&#10;guest whom they had taken me for, he exclaimed, &#39;By no means! I&#10;hate such squeamish morality.&#39; And he seemed much offended by my&#10;innocent question, as if it seemed by implication to condemn&#10;something in himself. He was offended and silent; and just at this&#10;moment I caught the sweet, attractive eyes of the lady opposite &#8212;&#10;that lady whom I named at first as being no longer in the bloom of&#10;youth, but as being somewhat infirm about the feet, which were&#10;supported on a raised cushion before her. Her looks seemed to say,&#10;&#39;Come here, and let us have some conversation together;&#39; and, with&#10;a bow of silent excuse to my little companion, I went across to the&#10;lame old lady. She acknowledged my coming with the prettiest&#10;gesture of thanks possible; and, half apologetically, said, &#39;It is&#10;a little dull to be unable to move about on such evenings as this;&#10;but it is a just punishment to me for my early vanities. My poor&#10;feet, that were by nature so small, are now taking their revenge&#10;for my cruelty in forcing them into such little slippers&#38;#160;&#8230;&#10;Besides, monsieur,&#39; with a pleasant smile, &#39;I thought it was&#10;possible you might be weary of the malicious sayings of your little&#10;neighbour. He has not borne the best character in his youth, and&#10;such men are sure to be cynical in their old age.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Who is he?&#39; asked I, with English abruptness.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;His name is Poucet, and his father was, I believe, a&#10;woodcutter, or charcoal burner, or something of the sort. They do&#10;tell sad stories of connivance at murder, ingratitude, and&#10;obtaining money on false pretences &#8212; but you will think me as bad&#10;as he if I go on with my slanders. Rather let us admire the lovely&#10;lady coming up towards us, with the roses in her hand &#8212; I never see&#10;her without roses, they are so closely connected with her past&#10;history, as you are doubtless aware. Ah, beauty!&#39; said my companion&#10;to the lady drawing near to us, &#39;it is like you to come to me, now&#10;that I can no longer go to you.&#39; Then turning to me, and gracefully&#10;drawing me into the conversation, she said, &#39;You must know that,&#10;although we never met until we were both married, we have been&#10;almost like sisters ever since. There have been so many points of&#10;resemblance in our circumstances, and I think I may say in our&#10;characters. We had each two elder sisters &#8212; mine were but&#10;half-sisters, though &#8212; who were not so kind to us as they might&#10;have been.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;But have been sorry for it since,&#39; put in the other lady.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Since we have married princes,&#39; continued the same lady, with&#10;an arch smile that had nothing of unkindness in it, &#39;for we both&#10;have married far above our original stations in life; we are both&#10;unpunctual in our habits, and, in consequence of this failing of&#10;ours, we have both had to suffer mortification and pain.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;And both are charming,&#39; said a whisper close behind me. &#39;My&#10;lord the marquis, say it &#8212; say, &#34;And both are charming.&#34;&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;And both are charming,&#39; was spoken aloud by another voice. I&#10;turned, and saw the wily cat-like chasseur, prompting his master to&#10;make civil speeches.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The ladies bowed with that kind of haughty acknowledgement which&#10;shows that compliments from such a source are distasteful. But our&#10;trio of conversation was broken up, and I was sorry for it. The&#10;marquis looked as if he had been stirred up to make that one&#10;speech, and hoped that he would not be expected to say more; while&#10;behind him stood the chasseur, half impertinent and half servile in&#10;his ways and attitudes. The ladies, who were real ladies, seemed to&#10;be sorry for the awkwardness of the marquis, and addressed some&#10;trifling questions to him, adapting themselves to the subjects on&#10;which he could have no trouble in answering. The chasseur,&#10;meanwhile, was talking to himself in a growling tone of voice. I&#10;had fallen a little into the background at this interruption in a&#10;conversation which promised to be so pleasant, and I could not help&#10;hearing his words.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Really, De Carabas grows more stupid every day. I have a great&#10;mind to throw off his boots, and leave him to his fate. I was&#10;intended for a court, and to a court I will go, and make my own&#10;fortune as I have made his. The emperor will appreciate my&#10;talents.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And such are the habits of the French, or such his forgetfulness&#10;of good manners in his anger, that he spat right and left on the&#10;parquetted floor.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Just then a very ugly, very pleasant-looking man, came towards&#10;the two ladies to whom I had lately been speaking, leading up to&#10;them a delicate, fair woman, dressed all in the softest white, as&#10;if she were vou&#233;e au blanc. I do not think there was a bit of&#10;colour about her. I thought I heard her making, as she came along,&#10;a little noise of pleasure, not exactly like the singing of a&#10;tea-kettle, nor yet like the cooing of a dove, but reminding me of&#10;each sound.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Madame de Mioumiou was anxious to see you,&#39; said he, addressing&#10;the lady with the roses, &#39;so I have brought her across to give you&#10;a pleasure!&#39; What an honest, good face! but oh! how ugly! And yet I&#10;liked his ugliness better than most persons&#39; beauty. There was a&#10;look of pathetic acknowledgement of his ugliness, and a deprecation&#10;of your too hasty judgement, in his countenance that was positively&#10;winning. The soft, white lady kept glancing at my neighbour the&#10;chasseur, as if they had had some former acquaintance, which&#10;puzzled me very much, as they were of such different rank. However,&#10;their nerves were evidently strung to the same tune, for at a sound&#10;behind the tapestry, which was more like the scuttering of rats and&#10;mice than anything else, both Madame de Mioumiou and the chasseur&#10;started with the most eager look of anxiety on their countenances,&#10;and by their restless movements &#8212; madame&#39;s panting, and the fiery&#10;dilation of his eyes &#8212; one might see that commonplace sounds&#10;affected them both in a manner very different to the rest of the&#10;company. The ugly husband of the lovely lady with the roses now&#10;addressed himself to me.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;We are much disappointed,&#39; he said, &#39;in finding that monsieur&#10;is not accompanied by his countryman &#8212; le grand Jean d&#39;Angleterre;&#10;I cannot pronounce his name rightly&#39; &#8212; and he looked at me to help&#10;him out.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Le grand Jean d&#39;Angleterre!&#39; now who was le grand Jean&#10;d&#39;Angleterre? John Bull? John Russell? John Bright?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Jean &#8212; Jean&#39; &#8212; continued the gentleman, seeing my&#10;embarrassment. &#39;Ah, these terrible English names &#8212; &#34;Jean de&#10;G&#233;anquilleur!&#34;&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I was as wise as ever. And yet the name struck me as familiar,&#10;but slightly disguised. I repeated it to myself. It was mighty like&#10;John the Giant-killer, only his friends always call that worthy&#10;&#39;Jack&#39;. I said the name aloud.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Ah, that is it!&#39; said he. &#39;But why has he not accompanied you&#10;to our little reunion to-night?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I had been rather puzzled once or twice before, but this serious&#10;question added considerably to my perplexity. Jack the Giant-killer&#10;had once, it is true, been rather an intimate friend of mine, as&#10;far as (printer&#39;s) ink and paper can keep up a friendship, but I&#10;had not heard his name mentioned for years; and for aught I knew he&#10;lay enchanted with King Arthur&#39;s knights, who lie entranced until&#10;the blast of the trumpets of four mighty kings shall call them to&#10;help at England&#39;s need. But the question had been asked in serious&#10;earnest by that gentleman, whom I more wished to think well of me&#10;than I did any other person in the room. So I answered respectfully&#10;that it was long since I had heard anything of my countryman; but&#10;that I was sure it would have given him as much pleasure as it was&#10;doing myself to have been present at such an agreeable gathering of&#10;friends. He bowed, and then the lame lady took up the word.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;To-night is the night when, of all the year, this great old&#10;forest surrounding the castle is said to be haunted by the phantom&#10;of a little peasant girl who once lived hereabouts; the tradition&#10;is that she was devoured by a wolf. In former days I have seen her&#10;on this night out of yonder window at the end of the gallery. Will&#10;you, ma belle, take monsieur to see the view outside by the&#10;moonlight (you may possibly see the phantom-child); and leave me to&#10;a little t&#234;te-&#224;-t&#234;te with your husband?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With a gentle movement the lady with the roses complied with the&#10;other&#39;s request, and we went to a great window, looking down on the&#10;forest, in which I had lost my way. The tops of the far-spreading&#10;and leafy trees lay motionless beneath us in the pale, wan light,&#10;which shows objects almost as distinct in form, though not in&#10;colour, as by day. We looked down on the countless avenues, which&#10;seemed to converge from all quarters to the great old castle; and&#10;suddenly across one, quite near to us, there passed the figure of a&#10;little girl, with the &#39;capuchon&#39; on, that takes the place of a&#10;peasant girl&#39;s bonnet in France. She had a basket on one arm, and&#10;by her, on the side to which her head was turned, there went a&#10;wolf. I could almost have said it was licking her hand, as if in&#10;penitent love, if either penitence or love had ever been a quality&#10;of wolves, &#8212; but though not of living, perhaps it may be of phantom&#10;wolves.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;There, we have seen her!&#39; exclaimed my beautiful companion.&#10;&#39;Though so long dead, her simple story of household goodness and&#10;trustful simplicity still lingers in the hearts of all who have&#10;ever heard of her; and the country-people about here say that&#10;seeing that phantom-child on this anniversary brings good luck for&#10;the year. Let us hope that we shall share in the traditionary good&#10;fortune. Ah! here is Madame de Retz &#8212; she retains the name of her&#10;first husband, you know, as he was of higher rank than the&#10;present.&#39; We were joined by our hostess.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;If monsieur is fond of the beauties of nature and art,&#39; said&#10;she, perceiving that I had been looking at the view from the great&#10;window, &#39;he will perhaps take pleasure in seeing the picture.&#39; Here&#10;she sighed, with a little affectation of grief. &#39;You know the&#10;picture I allude to,&#39; addressing my companion, who bowed assent,&#10;and smiled a little maliciously, as I followed the lead of&#10;madame.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I went after her to the other end of the saloon, noting by the&#10;way with what keen curiosity she caught up what was passing either&#10;in word or action on each side of her. When we stood opposite to&#10;the end wall, I perceived a full-length picture of a handsome,&#10;peculiar-looking man, with &#8212; in spite of his good looks &#8212; a very&#10;fierce and scowling expression. My hostess clasped her hands&#10;together as her arms hung down in front, and sighed once more.&#10;Then, half in soliloquy, she said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;He was the love of my youth; his stern yet manly character&#10;first touched this heart of mine. When &#8212; when shall I cease to&#10;deplore his loss!&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Not being acquainted with her enough to answer this question&#10;(if, indeed, it were not sufficiently answered by the fact of her&#10;second marriage), I felt awkward; and, by way of saying something,&#10;I remarked:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;The countenance strikes me as resembling something I have seen&#10;before &#8212; in an engraving from an historical picture, I think; only,&#10;it is there the principal figure in a group: he is holding a lady&#10;by her hair, and threatening her with his scimitar, while two&#10;cavaliers are rushing up the stairs, apparently only just in time&#10;to save her life.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Alas, alas!&#39; said she, &#39;you too accurately describe a miserable&#10;passage in my life, which has often been represented in a false&#10;light. The best of husbands&#39; &#8212; here she sobbed, and became slightly&#10;inarticulate with her grief &#8212; &#39;will sometimes be displeased. I was&#10;young and curious, he was justly angry with my disobedience &#8212; my&#10;brothers were too hasty &#8212; the consequence is, I became a&#10;widow!&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;After due respect for her tears, I ventured to suggest some&#10;commonplace consolation. She turned round sharply: &#8212;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;No, monsieur: my only comfort is that I have never forgiven the&#10;brothers who interfered so cruelly, in such an uncalled-for manner,&#10;between my dear husband and myself. To quote my friend Monsieur&#10;Sganarelle &#8212; &#34;Ce sont petites choses qui sont de temps en temps&#10;n&#233;cessaires dans l&#39;amiti&#233;; et cinq ou six coups d&#39;&#233;p&#233;e entre gens&#10;qui s&#39;aiment ne font que ragaillardir l&#39;affection.&#34; You observe the&#10;colouring is not quite what it should be?&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;In this light the beard is of rather a peculiar tint,&#39; said&#10;I.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Yes: the painter did not do it justice. It was most lovely, and&#10;gave him such a distinguished air, quite different from the common&#10;herd. Stay, I will show you the exact colour, if you will come near&#10;this flambeau!&#39; And going near the light, she took off a bracelet&#10;of hair, with a magnificent clasp of pearls. It was peculiar,&#10;certainly. I did not know what to say. &#39;His precious lovely beard!&#39;&#10;said she. &#39;And the pearls go so well with the delicate blue!&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Her husband, who had come up to us, and waited till her eye fell&#10;upon him before venturing to speak, now said, &#39;It is strange&#10;Monsieur Ogre is not yet arrived!&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Not at all strange,&#39; said she, tartly. &#39;He was always very&#10;stupid, and constantly falls into mistakes, in which he comes worse&#10;off; and it is very well he does, for he is credulous and cowardly&#10;fellow. Not at all strange! If you will&#39; &#8212; turning to her husband,&#10;so that I hardly heard her words, until I caught &#8212; &#39;Then everybody&#10;would have their rights, and we should have no more trouble. Is it&#10;not, monsieur?&#39; addressing me.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;If I were in England, I should imagine madame was speaking of&#10;the reform bill, or the millennium, &#8212; but I am in ignorance.&#39;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And just as I spoke, the great folding-doors were thrown open&#10;wide, and every one started to their feet to greet a little old&#10;lady, leaning on a thin black wand &#8212; and &#8212;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#39;Madame la F&#233;emarraine,&#39; was announced by a chorus of sweet&#10;shrill voices.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And in a moment I was lying in the grass close by a hollow&#10;oak-tree, with the slanting glory of the dawning day shining full&#10;in my face, and thousands of little birds and delicate insects&#10;piping and warbling out their welcome to the ruddy splendour.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 12, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/3335')
