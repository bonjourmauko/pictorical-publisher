Or at least so thought Tarzan of the&#10;Apes, who squatted upon a low-swinging branch in a near-by tree and&#10;looked down upon her.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Just to have seen him there, lolling upon the swaying bough of&#10;the jungle-forest giant, his brown skin mottled by the brilliant&#10;equatorial sunlight which percolated through the leafy canopy of&#10;green above him, his clean-limbed body relaxed in graceful ease,&#10;his shapely head partly turned in contemplative absorption and his&#10;intelligent, gray eyes dreamily devouring the object of their&#10;devotion, you would have thought him the reincarnation of some&#10;demigod of old.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;You would not have guessed that in infancy he had suckled at the&#10;breast of a hideous, hairy she-ape, nor that in all his conscious&#10;past since his parents had passed away in the little cabin by the&#10;landlocked harbor at the jungle&#39;s verge, he had known no other&#10;associates than the sullen bulls and the snarling cows of the tribe&#10;of Kerchak, the great ape.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Nor, could you have read the thoughts which passed through that&#10;active, healthy brain, the longings and desires and aspirations&#10;which the sight of Teeka inspired, would you have been any more&#10;inclined to give credence to the reality of the origin of the&#10;ape-man. For, from his thoughts alone, you could never have gleaned&#10;the truth&#8212;that he had been born to a gentle English lady or that&#10;his sire had been an English nobleman of time-honored lineage.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Lost to Tarzan of the Apes was the truth of his origin. That he&#10;was John Clayton, Lord Greystoke, with a seat in the House of&#10;Lords, he did not know, nor, knowing, would have understood.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Yes, Teeka was indeed beautiful!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Of course Kala had been beautiful&#8212;one&#39;s mother is always&#10;that&#8212;but Teeka was beautiful in a way all her own, an indescribable&#10;sort of way which Tarzan was just beginning to sense in a rather&#10;vague and hazy manner.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For years had Tarzan and Teeka been play-fellows, and Teeka&#10;still continued to be playful while the young bulls of her own age&#10;were rapidly becoming surly and morose. Tarzan, if he gave the&#10;matter much thought at all, probably reasoned that his growing&#10;attachment for the young female could be easily accounted for by&#10;the fact that of the former playmates she and he alone retained any&#10;desire to frolic as of old.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But today, as he sat gazing upon her, he found himself noting&#10;the beauties of Teeka&#39;s form and features&#8212;something he never had&#10;done before, since none of them had aught to do with Teeka&#39;s&#10;ability to race nimbly through the lower terraces of the forest in&#10;the primitive games of tag and hide-and-go-seek which Tarzan&#39;s&#10;fertile brain evolved. Tarzan scratched his head, running his&#10;fingers deep into the shock of black hair which framed his shapely,&#10;boyish face&#8212;he scratched his head and sighed. Teeka&#39;s new-found&#10;beauty became as suddenly his despair. He envied her the handsome&#10;coat of hair which covered her body. His own smooth, brown hide he&#10;hated with a hatred born of disgust and contempt. Years back he had&#10;harbored a hope that some day he, too, would be clothed in hair as&#10;were all his brothers and sisters; but of late he had been forced&#10;to abandon the delectable dream.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then there were Teeka&#39;s great teeth, not so large as the males,&#10;of course, but still mighty, handsome things by comparison with&#10;Tarzan&#39;s feeble white ones. And her beetling brows, and broad, flat&#10;nose, and her mouth! Tarzan had often practiced making his mouth&#10;into a little round circle and then puffing out his cheeks while he&#10;winked his eyes rapidly; but he felt that he could never do it in&#10;the same cute and irresistible way in which Teeka did it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And as he watched her that afternoon, and wondered, a young bull&#10;ape who had been lazily foraging for food beneath the damp, matted&#10;carpet of decaying vegetation at the roots of a near-by tree&#10;lumbered awkwardly in Teeka&#39;s direction. The other apes of the&#10;tribe of Kerchak moved listlessly about or lolled restfully in the&#10;midday heat of the equatorial jungle. From time to time one or&#10;another of them had passed close to Teeka, and Tarzan had been&#10;uninterested. Why was it then that his brows contracted and his&#10;muscles tensed as he saw Taug pause beside the young she and then&#10;squat down close to her?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan always had liked Taug. Since childhood they had romped&#10;together. Side by side they had squatted near the water, their&#10;quick, strong fingers ready to leap forth and seize Pisah, the&#10;fish, should that wary denizen of the cool depths dart surfaceward&#10;to the lure of the insects Tarzan tossed upon the face of the&#10;pool.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Together they had baited Tublat and teased Numa, the lion. Why,&#10;then, should Tarzan feel the rise of the short hairs at the nape of&#10;his neck merely because Taug sat close to Teeka?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It is true that Taug was no longer the frolicsome ape of&#10;yesterday. When his snarling-muscles bared his giant fangs no one&#10;could longer imagine that Taug was in as playful a mood as when he&#10;and Tarzan had rolled upon the turf in mimic battle. The Taug of&#10;today was a huge, sullen bull ape, somber and forbidding. Yet he&#10;and Tarzan never had quarreled.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For a few minutes the young ape-man watched Taug press closer to&#10;Teeka. He saw the rough caress of the huge paw as it stroked the&#10;sleek shoulder of the she, and then Tarzan of the Apes slipped&#10;catlike to the ground and approached the two.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As he came his upper lip curled into a snarl, exposing his&#10;fighting fangs, and a deep growl rumbled from his cavernous chest.&#10;Taug looked up, batting his blood-shot eyes. Teeka half raised&#10;herself and looked at Tarzan. Did she guess the cause of his&#10;perturbation? Who may say? At any rate, she was feminine, and so&#10;she reached up and scratched Taug behind one of his small, flat&#10;ears.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan saw, and in the instant that he saw, Teeka was no longer&#10;the little playmate of an hour ago; instead she was a wondrous&#10;thing&#8212;the most wondrous in the world&#8212;and a possession for which&#10;Tarzan would fight to the death against Taug or any other who dared&#10;question his right of proprietorship.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Stooped, his muscles rigid and one great shoulder turned toward&#10;the young bull, Tarzan of the Apes sidled nearer and nearer. His&#10;face was partly averted, but his keen gray eyes never left those of&#10;Taug, and as he came, his growls increased in depth and volume.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Taug rose upon his short legs, bristling. His fighting fangs&#10;were bared. He, too, sidled, stiff-legged, and growled.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Teeka is Tarzan&#39;s,&#34; said the ape-man, in the low gutturals of&#10;the great anthropoids.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Teeka is Taug&#39;s,&#34; replied the bull ape.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Thaka and Numgo and Gunto, disturbed by the growlings of the two&#10;young bulls, looked up half apathetic, half interested. They were&#10;sleepy, but they sensed a fight. It would break the monotony of the&#10;humdrum jungle life they led.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Coiled about his shoulders was Tarzan&#39;s long grass rope, in his&#10;hand was the hunting knife of the long-dead father he had never&#10;known. In Taug&#39;s little brain lay a great respect for the shiny bit&#10;of sharp metal which the ape-boy knew so well how to use. With it&#10;had he slain Tublat, his fierce foster father, and Bolgani, the&#10;gorilla. Taug knew these things, and so he came warily, circling&#10;about Tarzan in search of an opening. The latter, made cautious&#10;because of his lesser bulk and the inferiority of his natural&#10;armament, followed similar tactics.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For a time it seemed that the altercation would follow the way&#10;of the majority of such differences between members of the tribe&#10;and that one of them would finally lose interest and wander off to&#10;prosecute some other line of endeavor. Such might have been the end&#10;of it had the CASUS BELLI been other than it was; but Teeka was&#10;flattered at the attention that was being drawn to her and by the&#10;fact that these two young bulls were contemplating battle on her&#10;account. Such a thing never before had occurred in Teeka&#39;s brief&#10;life. She had seen other bulls battling for other and older shes,&#10;and in the depth of her wild little heart she had longed for the&#10;day when the jungle grasses would be reddened with the blood of&#10;mortal combat for her fair sake.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So now she squatted upon her haunches and insulted both her&#10;admirers impartially. She hurled taunts at them for their&#10;cowardice, and called them vile names, such as Histah, the snake,&#10;and Dango, the hyena. She threatened to call Mumga to chastise them&#10;with a stick&#8212;Mumga, who was so old that she could no longer climb&#10;and so toothless that she was forced to confine her diet almost&#10;exclusively to bananas and grub-worms.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The apes who were watching heard and laughed. Taug was&#10;infuriated. He made a sudden lunge for Tarzan, but the ape-boy&#10;leaped nimbly to one side, eluding him, and with the quickness of a&#10;cat wheeled and leaped back again to close quarters. His hunting&#10;knife was raised above his head as he came in, and he aimed a&#10;vicious blow at Taug&#39;s neck. The ape wheeled to dodge the weapon so&#10;that the keen blade struck him but a glancing blow upon the&#10;shoulder.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The spurt of red blood brought a shrill cry of delight from&#10;Teeka. Ah, but this was something worth while! She glanced about to&#10;see if others had witnessed this evidence of her popularity. Helen&#10;of Troy was never one whit more proud than was Teeka at that&#10;moment.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;If Teeka had not been so absorbed in her own vaingloriousness&#10;she might have noted the rustling of leaves in the tree above her&#8212;a&#10;rustling which was not caused by any movement of the wind, since&#10;there was no wind. And had she looked up she might have seen a&#10;sleek body crouching almost directly over her and wicked yellow&#10;eyes glaring hungrily down upon her, but Teeka did not look up.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With his wound Taug had backed off growling horribly. Tarzan had&#10;followed him, screaming insults at him, and menacing him with his&#10;brandishing blade. Teeka moved from beneath the tree in an effort&#10;to keep close to the duelists.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The branch above Teeka bent and swayed a trifle with the&#10;movement of the body of the watcher stretched along it. Taug had&#10;halted now and was preparing to make a new stand. His lips were&#10;flecked with foam, and saliva drooled from his jowls. He stood with&#10;head lowered and arms outstretched, preparing for a sudden charge&#10;to close quarters. Could he but lay his mighty hands upon that&#10;soft, brown skin the battle would be his. Taug considered Tarzan&#39;s&#10;manner of fighting unfair. He would not close. Instead, he leaped&#10;nimbly just beyond the reach of Taug&#39;s muscular fingers.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The ape-boy had as yet never come to a real trial of strength&#10;with a bull ape, other than in play, and so he was not at all sure&#10;that it would be safe to put his muscles to the test in a life and&#10;death struggle. Not that he was afraid, for Tarzan knew nothing of&#10;fear. The instinct of self-preservation gave him caution&#8212;that was&#10;all. He took risks only when it seemed necessary, and then he would&#10;hesitate at nothing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;His own method of fighting seemed best fitted to his build and&#10;to his armament. His teeth, while strong and sharp, were, as&#10;weapons of offense, pitifully inadequate by comparison with the&#10;mighty fighting fangs of the anthropoids. By dancing about, just&#10;out of reach of an antagonist, Tarzan could do infinite injury with&#10;his long, sharp hunting knife, and at the same time escape many of&#10;the painful and dangerous wounds which would be sure to follow his&#10;falling into the clutches of a bull ape.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And so Taug charged and bellowed like a bull, and Tarzan of the&#10;Apes danced lightly to this side and that, hurling jungle&#10;billingsgate at his foe, the while he nicked him now and again with&#10;his knife.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There were lulls in the fighting when the two would stand&#10;panting for breath, facing each other, mustering their wits and&#10;their forces for a new onslaught. It was during a pause such as&#10;this that Taug chanced to let his eyes rove beyond his foeman.&#10;Instantly the entire aspect of the ape altered. Rage left his&#10;countenance to be supplanted by an expression of fear.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With a cry that every ape there recognized, Taug turned and&#10;fled. No need to question him&#8212;his warning proclaimed the near&#10;presence of their ancient enemy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan started to seek safety, as did the other members of the&#10;tribe, and as he did so he heard a panther&#39;s scream mingled with&#10;the frightened cry of a she-ape. Taug heard, too; but he did not&#10;pause in his flight.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With the ape-boy, however, it was different. He looked back to&#10;see if any member of the tribe was close pressed by the beast of&#10;prey, and the sight that met his eyes filled them with an&#10;expression of horror.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Teeka it was who cried out in terror as she fled across a little&#10;clearing toward the trees upon the opposite side, for after her&#10;leaped Sheeta, the panther, in easy, graceful bounds. Sheeta&#10;appeared to be in no hurry. His meat was assured, since even though&#10;the ape reached the trees ahead of him she could not climb beyond&#10;his clutches before he could be upon her.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan saw that Teeka must die. He cried to Taug and the other&#10;bulls to hasten to Teeka&#39;s assistance, and at the same time he ran&#10;toward the pursuing beast, taking down his rope as he came. Tarzan&#10;knew that once the great bulls were aroused none of the jungle, not&#10;even Numa, the lion, was anxious to measure fangs with them, and&#10;that if all those of the tribe who chanced to be present today&#10;would charge, Sheeta, the great cat, would doubtless turn tail and&#10;run for his life.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Taug heard, as did the others, but no one came to Tarzan&#39;s&#10;assistance or Teeka&#39;s rescue, and Sheeta was rapidly closing up the&#10;distance between himself and his prey.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The ape-boy, leaping after the panther, cried aloud to the beast&#10;in an effort to turn it from Teeka or otherwise distract its&#10;attention until the she-ape could gain the safety of the higher&#10;branches where Sheeta dared not go. He called the panther every&#10;opprobrious name that fell to his tongue. He dared him to stop and&#10;do battle with him; but Sheeta only loped on after the luscious&#10;titbit now almost within his reach.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan was not far behind and he was gaining, but the distance&#10;was so short that he scarce hoped to overhaul the carnivore before&#10;it had felled Teeka. In his right hand the boy swung his grass rope&#10;above his head as he ran. He hated to chance a miss, for the&#10;distance was much greater than he ever had cast before except in&#10;practice. It was the full length of his grass rope which separated&#10;him from Sheeta, and yet there was no other thing to do. He could&#10;not reach the brute&#39;s side before it overhauled Teeka. He must&#10;chance a throw.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And just as Teeka sprang for the lower limb of a great tree, and&#10;Sheeta rose behind her in a long, sinuous leap, the coils of the&#10;ape-boy&#39;s grass rope shot swiftly through the air, straightening&#10;into a long thin line as the open noose hovered for an instant&#10;above the savage head and the snarling jaws. Then it settled&#8212;clean&#10;and true about the tawny neck it settled, and Tarzan, with a quick&#10;twist of his rope-hand, drew the noose taut, bracing himself for&#10;the shock when Sheeta should have taken up the slack.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Just short of Teeka&#39;s glossy rump the cruel talons raked the air&#10;as the rope tightened and Sheeta was brought to a sudden stop&#8212;a&#10;stop that snapped the big beast over upon his back. Instantly&#10;Sheeta was up&#8212;with glaring eyes, and lashing tail, and gaping jaws,&#10;from which issued hideous cries of rage and disappointment.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He saw the ape-boy, the cause of his discomfiture, scarce forty&#10;feet before him, and Sheeta charged.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Teeka was safe now; Tarzan saw to that by a quick glance into&#10;the tree whose safety she had gained not an instant too soon, and&#10;Sheeta was charging. It was useless to risk his life in idle and&#10;unequal combat from which no good could come; but could he escape a&#10;battle with the enraged cat? And if he was forced to fight, what&#10;chance had he to survive? Tarzan was constrained to admit that his&#10;position was aught but a desirable one. The trees were too far to&#10;hope to reach in time to elude the cat. Tarzan could but stand&#10;facing that hideous charge. In his right hand he grasped his&#10;hunting knife&#8212;a puny, futile thing indeed by comparison with the&#10;great rows of mighty teeth which lined Sheeta&#39;s powerful jaws, and&#10;the sharp talons encased within his padded paws; yet the young Lord&#10;Greystoke faced it with the same courageous resignation with which&#10;some fearless ancestor went down to defeat and death on Senlac Hill&#10;by Hastings.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;From safety points in the trees the great apes watched,&#10;screaming hatred at Sheeta and advice at Tarzan, for the&#10;progenitors of man have, naturally, many human traits. Teeka was&#10;frightened. She screamed at the bulls to hasten to Tarzan&#39;s&#10;assistance; but the bulls were otherwise engaged&#8212;principally in&#10;giving advice and making faces. Anyway, Tarzan was not a real&#10;Mangani, so why should they risk their lives in an effort to&#10;protect him?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And now Sheeta was almost upon the lithe, naked body, and&#8212;the&#10;body was not there. Quick as was the great cat, the ape-boy was&#10;quicker. He leaped to one side almost as the panther&#39;s talons were&#10;closing upon him, and as Sheeta went hurtling to the ground beyond,&#10;Tarzan was racing for the safety of the nearest tree.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The panther recovered himself almost immediately and, wheeling,&#10;tore after his prey, the ape-boy&#39;s rope dragging along the ground&#10;behind him. In doubling back after Tarzan, Sheeta had passed around&#10;a low bush. It was a mere nothing in the path of any jungle&#10;creature of the size and weight of Sheeta&#8212;provided it had no&#10;trailing rope dangling behind. But Sheeta was handicapped by such a&#10;rope, and as he leaped once again after Tarzan of the Apes the rope&#10;encircled the small bush, became tangled in it and brought the&#10;panther to a sudden stop. An instant later Tarzan was safe among&#10;the higher branches of a small tree into which Sheeta could not&#10;follow him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Here he perched, hurling twigs and epithets at the raging feline&#10;beneath him. The other members of the tribe now took up the&#10;bombardment, using such hard-shelled fruits and dead branches as&#10;came within their reach, until Sheeta, goaded to frenzy and&#10;snapping at the grass rope, finally succeeded in severing its&#10;strands. For a moment the panther stood glaring first at one of his&#10;tormentors and then at another, until, with a final scream of rage,&#10;he turned and slunk off into the tangled mazes of the jungle.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A half hour later the tribe was again upon the ground, feeding&#10;as though naught had occurred to interrupt the somber dullness of&#10;their lives. Tarzan had recovered the greater part of his rope and&#10;was busy fashioning a new noose, while Teeka squatted close behind&#10;him, in evident token that her choice was made.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Taug eyed them sullenly. Once when he came close, Teeka bared&#10;her fangs and growled at him, and Tarzan showed his canines in an&#10;ugly snarl; but Taug did not provoke a quarrel. He seemed to accept&#10;after the manner of his kind the decision of the she as an&#10;indication that he had been vanquished in his battle for her&#10;favors.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Later in the day, his rope repaired, Tarzan took to the trees in&#10;search of game. More than his fellows he required meat, and so,&#10;while they were satisfied with fruits and herbs and beetles, which&#10;could be discovered without much effort upon their part, Tarzan&#10;spent considerable time hunting the game animals whose flesh alone&#10;satisfied the cravings of his stomach and furnished sustenance and&#10;strength to the mighty thews which, day by day, were building&#10;beneath the soft, smooth texture of his brown hide.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Taug saw him depart, and then, quite casually, the big beast&#10;hunted closer and closer to Teeka in his search for food. At last&#10;he was within a few feet of her, and when he shot a covert glance&#10;at her he saw that she was appraising him and that there was no&#10;evidence of anger upon her face.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Taug expanded his great chest and rolled about on his short&#10;legs, making strange growlings in his throat. He raised his lips,&#10;baring his fangs. My, but what great, beautiful fangs he had! Teeka&#10;could not but notice them. She also let her eyes rest in admiration&#10;upon Taug&#39;s beetling brows and his short, powerful neck. What a&#10;beautiful creature he was indeed!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Taug, flattered by the unconcealed admiration in her eyes,&#10;strutted about, as proud and as vain as a peacock. Presently he&#10;began to inventory his assets, mentally, and shortly he found&#10;himself comparing them with those of his rival.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Taug grunted, for there was no comparison. How could one compare&#10;his beautiful coat with the smooth and naked hideousness of&#10;Tarzan&#39;s bare hide? Who could see beauty in the stingy nose of the&#10;Tarmangani after looking at Taug&#39;s broad nostrils? And Tarzan&#39;s&#10;eyes! Hideous things, showing white about them, and entirely&#10;unrimmed with red. Taug knew that his own blood-shot eyes were&#10;beautiful, for he had seen them reflected in the glassy surface of&#10;many a drinking pool.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The bull drew nearer to Teeka, finally squatting close against&#10;her. When Tarzan returned from his hunting a short time later it&#10;was to see Teeka contentedly scratching the back of his rival.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan was disgusted. Neither Taug nor Teeka saw him as he swung&#10;through the trees into the glade. He paused a moment, looking at&#10;them; then, with a sorrowful grimace, he turned and faded away into&#10;the labyrinth of leafy boughs and festooned moss out of which he&#10;had come.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan wished to be as far away from the cause of his heartache&#10;as he could. He was suffering the first pangs of blighted love, and&#10;he didn&#39;t quite know what was the matter with him. He thought that&#10;he was angry with Taug, and so he couldn&#39;t understand why it was&#10;that he had run away instead of rushing into mortal combat with the&#10;destroyer of his happiness.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He also thought that he was angry with Teeka, yet a vision of&#10;her many beauties persisted in haunting him, so that he could only&#10;see her in the light of love as the most desirable thing in the&#10;world.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The ape-boy craved affection. From babyhood until the time of&#10;her death, when the poisoned arrow of Kulonga had pierced her&#10;savage heart, Kala had represented to the English boy the sole&#10;object of love which he had known.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In her wild, fierce way Kala had loved her adopted son, and&#10;Tarzan had returned that love, though the outward demonstrations of&#10;it were no greater than might have been expected from any other&#10;beast of the jungle. It was not until he was bereft of her that the&#10;boy realized how deep had been his attachment for his mother, for&#10;as such he looked upon her.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In Teeka he had seen within the past few hours a substitute for&#10;Kala&#8212;someone to fight for and to hunt for&#8212;someone to caress; but&#10;now his dream was shattered. Something hurt within his breast. He&#10;placed his hand over his heart and wondered what had happened to&#10;him. Vaguely he attributed his pain to Teeka. The more he thought&#10;of Teeka as he had last seen her, caressing Taug, the more the&#10;thing within his breast hurt him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan shook his head and growled; then on and on through the&#10;jungle he swung, and the farther he traveled and the more he&#10;thought upon his wrongs, the nearer he approached becoming an&#10;irreclaimable misogynist.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Two days later he was still hunting alone&#8212;very morose and very&#10;unhappy; but he was determined never to return to the tribe. He&#10;could not bear the thought of seeing Taug and Teeka always&#10;together. As he swung upon a great limb Numa, the lion, and Sabor,&#10;the lioness, passed beneath him, side by side, and Sabor leaned&#10;against the lion and bit playfully at his cheek. It was a&#10;half-caress. Tarzan sighed and hurled a nut at them.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Later he came upon several of Mbonga&#39;s black warriors. He was&#10;upon the point of dropping his noose about the neck of one of them,&#10;who was a little distance from his companions, when he became&#10;interested in the thing which occupied the savages. They were&#10;building a cage in the trail and covering it with leafy branches.&#10;When they had completed their work the structure was scarcely&#10;visible.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan wondered what the purpose of the thing might be, and why,&#10;when they had built it, they turned away and started back along the&#10;trail in the direction of their village.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It had been some time since Tarzan had visited the blacks and&#10;looked down from the shelter of the great trees which overhung&#10;their palisade upon the activities of his enemies, from among whom&#10;had come the slayer of Kala.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Although he hated them, Tarzan derived considerable&#10;entertainment in watching them at their daily life within the&#10;village, and especially at their dances, when the fires glared&#10;against their naked bodies as they leaped and turned and twisted in&#10;mimic warfare. It was rather in the hope of witnessing something of&#10;the kind that he now followed the warriors back toward their&#10;village, but in this he was disappointed, for there was no dance&#10;that night.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Instead, from the safe concealment of his tree, Tarzan saw&#10;little groups seated about tiny fires discussing the events of the&#10;day, and in the darker corners of the village he descried isolated&#10;couples talking and laughing together, and always one of each&#10;couple was a young man and the other a young woman.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan cocked his head upon one side and thought, and before he&#10;went to sleep that night, curled in the crotch of the great tree&#10;above the village, Teeka filled his mind, and afterward she filled&#10;his dreams&#8212;she and the young black men laughing and talking with&#10;the young black women.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Taug, hunting alone, had wandered some distance from the balance&#10;of the tribe. He was making his way slowly along an elephant path&#10;when he discovered that it was blocked with undergrowth. Now Taug,&#10;come into maturity, was an evil-natured brute of an exceeding short&#10;temper. When something thwarted him, his sole idea was to overcome&#10;it by brute strength and ferocity, and so now when he found his way&#10;blocked, he tore angrily into the leafy screen and an instant later&#10;found himself within a strange lair, his progress effectually&#10;blocked, notwithstanding his most violent efforts to forge&#10;ahead.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Biting and striking at the barrier, Taug finally worked himself&#10;into a frightful rage, but all to no avail; and at last he became&#10;convinced that he must turn back. But when he would have done so,&#10;what was his chagrin to discover that another barrier had dropped&#10;behind him while he fought to break down the one before him! Taug&#10;was trapped. Until exhaustion overcame him he fought frantically&#10;for his freedom; but all for naught.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In the morning a party of blacks set out from the village of&#10;Mbonga in the direction of the trap they had constructed the&#10;previous day, while among the branches of the trees above them&#10;hovered a naked young giant filled with the curiosity of the wild&#10;things. Manu, the monkey, chattered and scolded as Tarzan passed,&#10;and though he was not afraid of the familiar figure of the ape-boy,&#10;he hugged closer to him the little brown body of his life&#39;s&#10;companion. Tarzan laughed as he saw it; but the laugh was followed&#10;by a sudden clouding of his face and a deep sigh.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A little farther on, a gaily feathered bird strutted about&#10;before the admiring eyes of his somber-hued mate. It seemed to&#10;Tarzan that everything in the jungle was combining to remind him&#10;that he had lost Teeka; yet every day of his life he had seen these&#10;same things and thought nothing of them.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When the blacks reached the trap, Taug set up a great commotion.&#10;Seizing the bars of his prison, he shook them frantically, and all&#10;the while he roared and growled terrifically. The blacks were&#10;elated, for while they had not built their trap for this hairy tree&#10;man, they were delighted with their catch.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan pricked up his ears when he heard the voice of a great&#10;ape and, circling quickly until he was down wind from the trap, he&#10;sniffed at the air in search of the scent spoor of the prisoner.&#10;Nor was it long before there came to those delicate nostrils the&#10;familiar odor that told Tarzan the identity of the captive as&#10;unerringly as though he had looked upon Taug with his eyes. Yes, it&#10;was Taug, and he was alone.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan grinned as he approached to discover what the blacks&#10;would do to their prisoner. Doubtless they would slay him at once.&#10;Again Tarzan grinned. Now he could have Teeka for his own, with&#10;none to dispute his right to her. As he watched, he saw the black&#10;warriors strip the screen from about the cage, fasten ropes to it&#10;and drag it away along the trail in the direction of their&#10;village.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan watched until his rival passed out of sight, still&#10;beating upon the bars of his prison and growling out his anger and&#10;his threats. Then the ape-boy turned and swung rapidly off in&#10;search of the tribe, and Teeka.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Once, upon the journey, he surprised Sheeta and his family in a&#10;little overgrown clearing. The great cat lay stretched upon the&#10;ground, while his mate, one paw across her lord&#39;s savage face,&#10;licked at the soft white fur at his throat.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan increased his speed then until he fairly flew through the&#10;forest, nor was it long before he came upon the tribe. He saw them&#10;before they saw him, for of all the jungle creatures, none passed&#10;more quietly than Tarzan of the Apes. He saw Kamma and her mate&#10;feeding side by side, their hairy bodies rubbing against each&#10;other. And he saw Teeka feeding by herself. Not for long would she&#10;feed thus in loneliness, thought Tarzan, as with a bound he landed&#10;amongst them.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There was a startled rush and a chorus of angry and frightened&#10;snarls, for Tarzan had surprised them; but there was more, too,&#10;than mere nervous shock to account for the bristling neck hair&#10;which remained standing long after the apes had discovered the&#10;identity of the newcomer.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan noticed this as he had noticed it many times in the&#10;past&#8212;that always his sudden coming among them left them nervous and&#10;unstrung for a considerable time, and that they one and all found&#10;it necessary to satisfy themselves that he was indeed Tarzan by&#10;smelling about him a half dozen or more times before they calmed&#10;down.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Pushing through them, he made his way toward Teeka; but as he&#10;approached her the ape drew away.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Teeka,&#34; he said, &#34;it is Tarzan. You belong to Tarzan. I have&#10;come for you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The ape drew closer, looking him over carefully. Finally she&#10;sniffed at him, as though to make assurance doubly sure.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Where is Taug?&#34; she asked.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The Gomangani have him,&#34; replied Tarzan. &#34;They will kill&#10;him.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In the eyes of the she, Tarzan saw a wistful expression and a&#10;troubled look of sorrow as he told her of Taug&#39;s fate; but she came&#10;quite close and snuggled against him, and Tarzan, Lord Greystoke,&#10;put his arm about her.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As he did so he noticed, with a start, the strange incongruity&#10;of that smooth, brown arm against the black and hairy coat of his&#10;lady-love. He recalled the paw of Sheeta&#39;s mate across Sheeta&#39;s&#10;face&#8212;no incongruity there. He thought of little Manu hugging his&#10;she, and how the one seemed to belong to the other. Even the proud&#10;male bird, with his gay plumage, bore a close resemblance to his&#10;quieter spouse, while Numa, but for his shaggy mane, was almost a&#10;counterpart of Sabor, the lioness. The males and the females&#10;differed, it was true; but not with such differences as existed&#10;between Tarzan and Teeka.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan was puzzled. There was something wrong. His arm dropped&#10;from the shoulder of Teeka. Very slowly he drew away from her. She&#10;looked at him with her head cocked upon one side. Tarzan rose to&#10;his full height and beat upon his breast with his fists. He raised&#10;his head toward the heavens and opened his mouth. From the depths&#10;of his lungs rose the fierce, weird challenge of the victorious&#10;bull ape. The tribe turned curiously to eye him. He had killed&#10;nothing, nor was there any antagonist to be goaded to madness by&#10;the savage scream. No, there was no excuse for it, and they turned&#10;back to their feeding, but with an eye upon the ape-man lest he be&#10;preparing to suddenly run amuck.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As they watched him they saw him swing into a near-by tree and&#10;disappear from sight. Then they forgot him, even Teeka.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mbonga&#39;s black warriors, sweating beneath their strenuous task,&#10;and resting often, made slow progress toward their village. Always&#10;the savage beast in the primitive cage growled and roared when they&#10;moved him. He beat upon the bars and slavered at the mouth. His&#10;noise was hideous.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;They had almost completed their journey and were making their&#10;final rest before forging ahead to gain the clearing in which lay&#10;their village. A few more minutes would have taken them out of the&#10;forest, and then, doubtless, the thing would not have happened&#10;which did happen.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A silent figure moved through the trees above them. Keen eyes&#10;inspected the cage and counted the number of warriors. An alert and&#10;daring brain figured upon the chances of success when a certain&#10;plan should be put to the test.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan watched the blacks lolling in the shade. They were&#10;exhausted. Already several of them slept. He crept closer, pausing&#10;just above them. Not a leaf rustled before his stealthy advance. He&#10;waited in the infinite patience of the beast of prey. Presently but&#10;two of the warriors remained awake, and one of these was&#10;dozing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan of the Apes gathered himself, and as he did so the black&#10;who did not sleep arose and passed around to the rear of the cage.&#10;The ape-boy followed just above his head. Taug was eyeing the&#10;warrior and emitting low growls. Tarzan feared that the anthropoid&#10;would awaken the sleepers.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In a whisper which was inaudible to the ears of the Negro,&#10;Tarzan whispered Taug&#39;s name, cautioning the ape to silence, and&#10;Taug&#39;s growling ceased.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The black approached the rear of the cage and examined the&#10;fastenings of the door, and as he stood there the beast above him&#10;launched itself from the tree full upon his back. Steel fingers&#10;circled his throat, choking the cry which sprang to the lips of the&#10;terrified man. Strong teeth fastened themselves in his shoulder,&#10;and powerful legs wound themselves about his torso.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The black in a frenzy of terror tried to dislodge the silent&#10;thing which clung to him. He threw himself to the ground and rolled&#10;about; but still those mighty fingers closed more and more tightly&#10;their deadly grip.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The man&#39;s mouth gaped wide, his swollen tongue protruded, his&#10;eyes started from their sockets; but the relentless fingers only&#10;increased their pressure.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Taug was a silent witness of the struggle. In his fierce little&#10;brain he doubtless wondered what purpose prompted Tarzan to attack&#10;the black. Taug had not forgotten his recent battle with the&#10;ape-boy, nor the cause of it. Now he saw the form of the Gomangani&#10;suddenly go limp. There was a convulsive shiver and the man lay&#10;still.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan sprang from his prey and ran to the door of the cage.&#10;With nimble fingers he worked rapidly at the thongs which held the&#10;door in place. Taug could only watch&#8212;he could not help. Presently&#10;Tarzan pushed the thing up a couple of feet and Taug crawled out.&#10;The ape would have turned upon the sleeping blacks that he might&#10;wreak his pent vengeance; but Tarzan would not permit it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Instead, the ape-boy dragged the body of the black within the&#10;cage and propped it against the side bars. Then he lowered the door&#10;and made fast the thongs as they had been before.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A happy smile lighted his features as he worked, for one of his&#10;principal diversions was the baiting of the blacks of Mbonga&#39;s&#10;village. He could imagine their terror when they awoke and found&#10;the dead body of their comrade fast in the cage where they had left&#10;the great ape safely secured but a few minutes before.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan and Taug took to the trees together, the shaggy coat of&#10;the fierce ape brushing the sleek skin of the English lordling as&#10;they passed through the primeval jungle side by side.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Go back to Teeka,&#34; said Tarzan. &#34;She is yours. Tarzan does not&#10;want her.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Tarzan has found another she?&#34; asked Taug.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The ape-boy shrugged.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;For the Gomangani there is another Gomangani,&#34; he said; &#34;for&#10;Numa, the lion, there is Sabor, the lioness; for Sheeta there is a&#10;she of his own kind; for Bara, the deer; for Manu, the monkey; for&#10;all the beasts and the birds of the jungle is there a mate. Only&#10;for Tarzan of the Apes is there none. Taug is an ape. Teeka is an&#10;ape. Go back to Teeka. Tarzan is a man. He will go alone.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 15, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/943')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Capture of Tarzan'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;THE BLACK WARRIORS labored in the humid heat of the jungle&#39;s&#10;stifling shade. With war spears they loosened the thick, black loam&#10;and the deep layers of rotting vegetation. With heavy-nailed&#10;fingers they scooped away the disintegrated earth from the center&#10;of the age-old game trail. Often they ceased their labors to squat,&#10;resting and gossiping, with much laughter, at the edge of the pit&#10;they were digging.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Against the boles of near-by trees leaned their long, oval&#10;shields of thick buffalo hide, and the spears of those who were&#10;doing the scooping. Sweat glistened upon their smooth, ebon skins,&#10;beneath which rolled rounded muscles, supple in the perfection of&#10;nature&#39;s uncontaminated health.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A reed buck, stepping warily along the trail toward water,&#10;halted as a burst of laughter broke upon his startled ears. For a&#10;moment he stood statuesque but for his sensitively dilating&#10;nostrils; then he wheeled and fled noiselessly from the terrifying&#10;presence of man.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A hundred yards away, deep in the tangle of impenetrable jungle,&#10;Numa, the lion, raised his massive head. Numa had dined well until&#10;almost daybreak and it had required much noise to awaken him. Now&#10;he lifted his muzzle and sniffed the air, caught the acrid scent&#10;spoor of the reed buck and the heavy scent of man. But Numa was&#10;well filled. With a low, disgusted grunt he rose and slunk&#10;away.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Brilliantly plumaged birds with raucous voices darted from tree&#10;to tree. Little monkeys, chattering and scolding, swung through the&#10;swaying limbs above the black warriors. Yet they were alone, for&#10;the teeming jungle with all its myriad life, like the swarming&#10;streets of a great metropolis, is one of the loneliest spots in&#10;God&#39;s great universe.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But were they alone?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Above them, lightly balanced upon a leafy tree limb, a gray-eyed&#10;youth watched with eager intentness their every move. The fire of&#10;hate, restrained, smoldered beneath the lad&#39;s evident desire to&#10;know the purpose of the black men&#39;s labors. Such a one as these it&#10;was who had slain his beloved Kala. For them there could be naught&#10;but enmity, yet he liked well to watch them, avid as he was for&#10;greater knowledge of the ways of man.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He saw the pit grow in depth until a great hole yawned the width&#10;of the trail&#8212;a hole which was amply large enough to hold at one&#10;time all of the six excavators. Tarzan could not guess the purpose&#10;of so great a labor. And when they cut long stakes, sharpened at&#10;their upper ends, and set them at intervals upright in the bottom&#10;of the pit, his wonderment but increased, nor was it satisfied with&#10;the placing of the light cross-poles over the pit, or the careful&#10;arrangement of leaves and earth which completely hid from view the&#10;work the black men had performed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When they were done they surveyed their handiwork with evident&#10;satisfaction, and Tarzan surveyed it, too. Even to his practiced&#10;eye there remained scarce a vestige of evidence that the ancient&#10;game trail had been tampered with in any way.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So absorbed was the ape-man in speculation as to the purpose of&#10;the covered pit that he permitted the blacks to depart in the&#10;direction of their village without the usual baiting which had&#10;rendered him the terror of Mbonga&#39;s people and had afforded Tarzan&#10;both a vehicle of revenge and a source of inexhaustible&#10;delight.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Puzzle as he would, however, he could not solve the mystery of&#10;the concealed pit, for the ways of the blacks were still strange&#10;ways to Tarzan. They had entered his jungle but a short time&#10;before&#8212;the first of their kind to encroach upon the age-old&#10;supremacy of the beasts which laired there. To Numa, the lion, to&#10;Tantor, the elephant, to the great apes and the lesser apes, to&#10;each and all of the myriad creatures of this savage wild, the ways&#10;of man were new. They had much to learn of these black, hairless&#10;creatures that walked erect upon their hind paws&#8212;and they were&#10;learning it slowly, and always to their sorrow.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Shortly after the blacks had departed, Tarzan swung easily to&#10;the trail. Sniffing suspiciously, he circled the edge of the pit.&#10;Squatting upon his haunches, he scraped away a little earth to&#10;expose one of the cross-bars. He sniffed at this, touched it,&#10;cocked his head upon one side, and contemplated it gravely for&#10;several minutes. Then he carefully re-covered it, arranging the&#10;earth as neatly as had the blacks. This done, he swung himself back&#10;among the branches of the trees and moved off in search of his&#10;hairy fellows, the great apes of the tribe of Kerchak.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Once he crossed the trail of Numa, the lion, pausing for a&#10;moment to hurl a soft fruit at the snarling face of his enemy, and&#10;to taunt and insult him, calling him eater of carrion and brother&#10;of Dango, the hyena. Numa, his yellow-green eyes round and burning&#10;with concentrated hate, glared up at the dancing figure above him.&#10;Low growls vibrated his heavy jowls and his great rage transmitted&#10;to his sinuous tail a sharp, whiplike motion; but realizing from&#10;past experience the futility of long distance argument with the&#10;ape-man, he turned presently and struck off into the tangled&#10;vegetation which hid him from the view of his tormentor. With a&#10;final scream of jungle invective and an apelike grimace at his&#10;departing foe, Tarzan continued along his way.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Another mile and a shifting wind brought to his keen nostrils a&#10;familiar, pungent odor close at hand, and a moment later there&#10;loomed beneath him a huge, gray-black bulk forging steadily along&#10;the jungle trail. Tarzan seized and broke a small tree limb, and at&#10;the sudden cracking sound the ponderous figure halted. Great ears&#10;were thrown forward, and a long, supple trunk rose quickly to wave&#10;to and fro in search of the scent of an enemy, while two weak,&#10;little eyes peered suspiciously and futilely about in quest of the&#10;author of the noise which had disturbed his peaceful way.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan laughed aloud and came closer above the head of the&#10;pachyderm.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Tantor! Tantor!&#34; he cried. &#34;Bara, the deer, is less fearful&#10;than you&#8212;you, Tantor, the elephant, greatest of the jungle folk&#10;with the strength of as many Numas as I have toes upon my feet and&#10;fingers upon my hands. Tantor, who can uproot great trees, trembles&#10;with fear at the sound of a broken twig.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A rumbling noise, which might have been either a sign of&#10;contempt or a sigh of relief, was Tantor&#39;s only reply as the&#10;uplifted trunk and ears came down and the beast&#39;s tail dropped to&#10;normal; but his eyes still roved about in search of Tarzan. He was&#10;not long kept in suspense, however, as to the whereabouts of the&#10;ape-man, for a second later the youth dropped lightly to the broad&#10;head of his old friend. Then stretching himself at full length, he&#10;drummed with his bare toes upon the thick hide, and as his fingers&#10;scratched the more tender surfaces beneath the great ears, he&#10;talked to Tantor of the gossip of the jungle as though the great&#10;beast understood every word that he said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Much there was which Tarzan could make Tantor understand, and&#10;though the small talk of the wild was beyond the great, gray&#10;dreadnaught of the jungle, he stood with blinking eyes and gently&#10;swaying trunk as though drinking in every word of it with keenest&#10;appreciation. As a matter of fact it was the pleasant, friendly&#10;voice and caressing hands behind his ears which he enjoyed, and the&#10;close proximity of him whom he had often borne upon his back since&#10;Tarzan, as a little child, had once fearlessly approached the great&#10;bull, assuming upon the part of the pachyderm the same friendliness&#10;which filled his own heart.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In the years of their association Tarzan had discovered that he&#10;possessed an inexplicable power to govern and direct his mighty&#10;friend. At his bidding, Tantor would come from a great distance&#8212;as&#10;far as his keen ears could detect the shrill and piercing summons&#10;of the ape-man&#8212;and when Tarzan was squatted upon his head, Tantor&#10;would lumber through the jungle in any direction which his rider&#10;bade him go. It was the power of the man-mind over that of the&#10;brute and it was just as effective as though both fully understood&#10;its origin, though neither did.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For half an hour Tarzan sprawled there upon Tantor&#39;s back. Time&#10;had no meaning for either of them. Life, as they saw it, consisted&#10;principally in keeping their stomachs filled. To Tarzan this was a&#10;less arduous labor than to Tantor, for Tarzan&#39;s stomach was&#10;smaller, and being omnivorous, food was less difficult to obtain.&#10;If one sort did not come readily to hand, there were always many&#10;others to satisfy his hunger. He was less particular as to his diet&#10;than Tantor, who would eat only the bark of certain trees, and the&#10;wood of others, while a third appealed to him only through its&#10;leaves, and these, perhaps, just at certain seasons of the&#10;year.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tantor must needs spend the better part of his life in filling&#10;his immense stomach against the needs of his mighty thews. It is&#10;thus with all the lower orders&#8212;their lives are so occupied either&#10;with searching for food or with the processes of digestion that&#10;they have little time for other considerations. Doubtless it is&#10;this handicap which has kept them from advancing as rapidly as man,&#10;who has more time to give to thought upon other matters.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;However, these questions troubled Tarzan but little, and Tantor&#10;not at all. What the former knew was that he was happy in the&#10;companionship of the elephant. He did not know why. He did not know&#10;that because he was a human being&#8212; a normal, healthy human being&#8212;he&#10;craved some living thing upon which to lavish his affection. His&#10;childhood playmates among the apes of Kerchak were now great,&#10;sullen brutes. They felt nor inspired but little affection. The&#10;younger apes Tarzan still played with occasionally. In his savage&#10;way he loved them; but they were far from satisfying or restful&#10;companions. Tantor was a great mountain of calm, of poise, of&#10;stability. It was restful and satisfying to sprawl upon his rough&#10;pate and pour one&#39;s vague hopes and aspirations into the great ears&#10;which flapped ponderously to and fro in apparent understanding. Of&#10;all the jungle folk, Tantor commanded Tarzan&#39;s greatest love since&#10;Kala had been taken from him. Sometimes Tarzan wondered if Tantor&#10;reciprocated his affection. It was difficult to know.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was the call of the stomach&#8212;the most compelling and insistent&#10;call which the jungle knows&#8212;that took Tarzan finally back to the&#10;trees and off in search of food, while Tantor continued his&#10;interrupted journey in the opposite direction.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For an hour the ape-man foraged. A lofty nest yielded its fresh,&#10;warm harvest. Fruits, berries, and tender plantain found a place&#10;upon his menu in the order that he happened upon them, for he did&#10;not seek such foods. Meat, meat, meat! It was always meat that&#10;Tarzan of the Apes hunted; but sometimes meat eluded him, as&#10;today.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And as he roamed the jungle his active mind busied itself not&#10;alone with his hunting, but with many other subjects. He had a&#10;habit of recalling often the events of the preceding days and&#10;hours. He lived over his visit with Tantor; he cogitated upon the&#10;digging blacks and the strange, covered pit they had left behind&#10;them. He wondered again and again what its purpose might be. He&#10;compared perceptions and arrived at judgments. He compared&#10;judgments, reaching conclusions&#8212;not always correct ones, it is&#10;true, but at least he used his brain for the purpose God intended&#10;it, which was the less difficult because he was not handicapped by&#10;the second-hand, and usually erroneous, judgment of others.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And as he puzzled over the covered pit, there loomed suddenly&#10;before his mental vision a huge, gray-black bulk which lumbered&#10;ponderously along a jungle trail. Instantly Tarzan tensed to the&#10;shock of a sudden fear. Decision and action usually occurred&#10;simultaneously in the life of the ape-man, and now he was away&#10;through the leafy branches ere the realization of the pit&#39;s purpose&#10;had scarce formed in his mind.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Swinging from swaying limb to swaying limb, he raced through the&#10;middle terraces where the trees grew close together. Again he&#10;dropped to the ground and sped, silently and light of foot, over&#10;the carpet of decaying vegetation, only to leap again into the&#10;trees where the tangled undergrowth precluded rapid advance upon&#10;the surface.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In his anxiety he cast discretion to the winds. The caution of&#10;the beast was lost in the loyalty of the man, and so it came that&#10;he entered a large clearing, denuded of trees, without a thought of&#10;what might lie there or upon the farther edge to dispute the way&#10;with him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He was half way across when directly in his path and but a few&#10;yards away there rose from a clump of tall grasses a half dozen&#10;chattering birds. Instantly Tarzan turned aside, for he knew well&#10;enough what manner of creature the presence of these little&#10;sentinels proclaimed. Simultaneously Buto, the rhinoceros,&#10;scrambled to his short legs and charged furiously. Haphazard&#10;charges Buto, the rhinoceros. With his weak eyes he sees but poorly&#10;even at short distances, and whether his erratic rushes are due to&#10;the panic of fear as he attempts to escape, or to the irascible&#10;temper with which he is generally credited, it is difficult to&#10;determine. Nor is the matter of little moment to one whom Buto&#10;charges, for if he be caught and tossed, the chances are that&#10;naught will interest him thereafter.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And today it chanced that Buto bore down straight upon Tarzan,&#10;across the few yards of knee-deep grass which separated them.&#10;Accident started him in the direction of the ape-man, and then his&#10;weak eyes discerned the enemy, and with a series of snorts he&#10;charged straight for him. The little rhino birds fluttered and&#10;circled about their giant ward. Among the branches of the trees at&#10;the edge of the clearing, a score or more monkeys chattered and&#10;scolded as the loud snorts of the angry beast sent them scurrying&#10;affrightedly to the upper terraces. Tarzan alone appeared&#10;indifferent and serene.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Directly in the path of the charge he stood. There had been no&#10;time to seek safety in the trees beyond the clearing, nor had&#10;Tarzan any mind to delay his journey because of Buto. He had met&#10;the stupid beast before and held him in fine contempt.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And now Buto was upon him, the massive head lowered and the&#10;long, heavy horn inclined for the frightful work for which nature&#10;had designed it; but as he struck upward, his weapon raked only&#10;thin air, for the ape-man had sprung lightly aloft with a catlike&#10;leap that carried him above the threatening horn to the broad back&#10;of the rhinoceros. Another spring and he was on the ground behind&#10;the brute and racing like a deer for the trees.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Buto, angered and mystified by the strange disappearance of his&#10;prey, wheeled and charged frantically in another direction, which&#10;chanced to be not the direction of Tarzan&#39;s flight, and so the&#10;ape-man came in safety to the trees and continued on his swift way&#10;through the forest.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Some distance ahead of him Tantor moved steadily along the&#10;well-worn elephant trail, and ahead of Tantor a crouching, black&#10;warrior listened intently in the middle of the path. Presently he&#10;heard the sound for which he had been hoping&#8212; the cracking,&#10;snapping sound which heralded the approach of an elephant.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;To his right and left in other parts of the jungle other&#10;warriors were watching. A low signal, passed from one to another,&#10;apprised the most distant that the quarry was afoot. Rapidly they&#10;converged toward the trail, taking positions in trees down wind&#10;from the point at which Tantor must pass them. Silently they waited&#10;and presently were rewarded by the sight of a mighty tusker&#10;carrying an amount of ivory in his long tusks that set their greedy&#10;hearts to palpitating.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;No sooner had he passed their positions than the warriors&#10;clambered from their perches. No longer were they silent, but&#10;instead clapped their hands and shouted as they reached the ground.&#10;For an instant Tantor, the elephant, paused with upraised trunk and&#10;tail, with great ears up-pricked, and then he swung on along the&#10;trail at a rapid, shuffling pace&#8212;straight toward the covered pit&#10;with its sharpened stakes upstanding in the ground.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Behind him came the yelling warriors, urging him on in the rapid&#10;flight which would not permit a careful examination of the ground&#10;before him. Tantor, the elephant, who could have turned and&#10;scattered his adversaries with a single charge, fled like a&#10;frightened deer&#8212;fled toward a hideous, torturing death.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And behind them all came Tarzan of the Apes, racing through the&#10;jungle forest with the speed and agility of a squirrel, for he had&#10;heard the shouts of the warriors and had interpreted them&#10;correctly. Once he uttered a piercing call that reverberated&#10;through the jungle; but Tantor, in the panic of terror, either&#10;failed to hear, or hearing, dared not pause to heed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now the giant pachyderm was but a few yards from the hidden&#10;death lurking in his path, and the blacks, certain of success, were&#10;screaming and dancing in his wake, waving their war spears and&#10;celebrating in advance the acquisition of the splendid ivory&#10;carried by their prey and the surfeit of elephant meat which would&#10;be theirs this night.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So intent were they upon their gratulations that they entirely&#10;failed to note the silent passage of the man-beast above their&#10;heads, nor did Tantor, either, see or hear him, even though Tarzan&#10;called to him to stop.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A few more steps would precipitate Tantor upon the sharpened&#10;stakes; Tarzan fairly flew through the trees until he had come&#10;abreast of the fleeing animal and then had passed him. At the pit&#39;s&#10;verge the ape-man dropped to the ground in the center of the trail.&#10;Tantor was almost upon him before his weak eyes permitted him to&#10;recognize his old friend.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Stop!&#34; cried Tarzan, and the great beast halted to the upraised&#10;hand.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan turned and kicked aside some of the brush which hid the&#10;pit. Instantly Tantor saw and understood.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Fight!&#34; growled Tarzan. &#34;They are coming behind you.&#34; But&#10;Tantor, the elephant, is a huge bunch of nerves, and now he was&#10;half panic-stricken by terror.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Before him yawned the pit, how far he did not know, but to right&#10;and left lay the primeval jungle untouched by man. With a squeal&#10;the great beast turned suddenly at right angles and burst his noisy&#10;way through the solid wall of matted vegetation that would have&#10;stopped any but him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan, standing upon the edge of the pit, smiled as he watched&#10;Tantor&#39;s undignified flight. Soon the blacks would come. It was&#10;best that Tarzan of the Apes faded from the scene. He essayed a&#10;step from the pit&#39;s edge, and as he threw the weight of his body&#10;upon his left foot, the earth crumbled away. Tarzan made a single&#10;Herculean effort to throw himself forward, but it was too late.&#10;Backward and downward he went toward the sharpened stakes in the&#10;bottom of the pit.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When, a moment later, the blacks came they saw even from a&#10;distance that Tantor had eluded them, for the size of the hole in&#10;the pit covering was too small to have accommodated the huge bulk&#10;of an elephant. At first they thought that their prey had put one&#10;great foot through the top and then, warned, drawn back; but when&#10;they had come to the pit&#39;s verge and peered over, their eyes went&#10;wide in astonishment, for, quiet and still, at the bottom lay the&#10;naked figure of a white giant.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Some of them there had glimpsed this forest god before and they&#10;drew back in terror, awed by the presence which they had for some&#10;time believed to possess the miraculous powers of a demon; but&#10;others there were who pushed forward, thinking only of the capture&#10;of an enemy, and these leaped into the pit and lifted Tarzan&#10;out.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There was no scar upon his body. None of the sharpened stakes&#10;had pierced him&#8212;only a swollen spot at the base of the brain&#10;indicated the nature of his injury. In the falling backward his&#10;head had struck upon the side of one of the stakes, rendering him&#10;unconscious. The blacks were quick to discover this, and equally&#10;quick to bind their prisoner&#39;s arms and legs before he should&#10;regain consciousness, for they had learned to harbor a wholesome&#10;respect for this strange man-beast that consorted with the hairy&#10;tree folk.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;They had carried him but a short distance toward their village&#10;when the ape-man&#39;s eyelids quivered and raised. He looked about him&#10;wonderingly for a moment, and then full consciousness returned and&#10;he realized the seriousness of his predicament. Accustomed almost&#10;from birth to relying solely upon his own resources, he did not&#10;cast about for outside aid now, but devoted his mind to a&#10;consideration of the possibilities for escape which lay within&#10;himself and his own powers.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He did not dare test the strength of his bonds while the blacks&#10;were carrying him, for fear they would become apprehensive and add&#10;to them. Presently his captors discovered that he was conscious,&#10;and as they had little stomach for carrying a heavy man through the&#10;jungle heat, they set him upon his feet and forced him forward&#10;among them, pricking him now and then with their spears, yet with&#10;every manifestation of the superstitious awe in which they held&#10;him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When they discovered that their prodding brought no outward&#10;evidence of suffering, their awe increased, so that they soon&#10;desisted, half believing that this strange white giant was a&#10;supernatural being and so was immune from pain.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As they approached their village, they shouted aloud the&#10;victorious cries of successful warriors, so that by the time they&#10;reached the gate, dancing and waving their spears, a great crowd of&#10;men, women, and children were gathered there to greet them and hear&#10;the story of their adventure.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As the eyes of the villagers fell upon the prisoner, they went&#10;wild, and heavy jaws fell open in astonishment and incredulity. For&#10;months they had lived in perpetual terror of a weird, white demon&#10;whom but few had ever glimpsed and lived to describe. Warriors had&#10;disappeared from the paths almost within sight of the village and&#10;from the midst of their companions as mysteriously and completely&#10;as though they had been swallowed by the earth, and later, at&#10;night, their dead bodies had fallen, as from the heavens, into the&#10;village street.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;This fearsome creature had appeared by night in the huts of the&#10;village, killed, and disappeared, leaving behind him in the huts&#10;with his dead, strange and terrifying evidences of an uncanny sense&#10;of humor.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But now he was in their power! No longer could he terrorize&#10;them. Slowly the realization of this dawned upon them. A woman,&#10;screaming, ran forward and struck the ape-man across the face.&#10;Another and another followed her example, until Tarzan of the Apes&#10;was surrounded by a fighting, clawing, yelling mob of natives.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And then Mbonga, the chief, came, and laying his spear heavily&#10;across the shoulders of his people, drove them from their prey.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;We will save him until night,&#34; he said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Far out in the jungle Tantor, the elephant, his first panic of&#10;fear allayed, stood with up-pricked ears and undulating trunk. What&#10;was passing through the convolutions of his savage brain? Could he&#10;be searching for Tarzan? Could he recall and measure the service&#10;the ape-man had performed for him? Of that there can be no doubt.&#10;But did he feel gratitude? Would he have risked his own life to&#10;have saved Tarzan could he have known of the danger which&#10;confronted his friend? You will doubt it. Anyone at all familiar&#10;with elephants will doubt it. Englishmen who have hunted much with&#10;elephants in India will tell you that they never have heard of an&#10;instance in which one of these animals has gone to the aid of a man&#10;in danger, even though the man had often befriended it. And so it&#10;is to be doubted that Tantor would have attempted to overcome his&#10;instinctive fear of the black men in an effort to succor&#10;Tarzan.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The screams of the infuriated villagers came faintly to his&#10;sensitive ears, and he wheeled, as though in terror, contemplating&#10;flight; but something stayed him, and again he turned about, raised&#10;his trunk, and gave voice to a shrill cry.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then he stood listening.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In the distant village where Mbonga had restored quiet and&#10;order, the voice of Tantor was scarcely audible to the blacks, but&#10;to the keen ears of Tarzan of the Apes it bore its message.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;His captors were leading him to a hut where he might be confined&#10;and guarded against the coming of the nocturnal orgy that would&#10;mark his torture-laden death. He halted as he heard the notes of&#10;Tantor&#39;s call, and raising his head, gave vent to a terrifying&#10;scream that sent cold chills through the superstitious blacks and&#10;caused the warriors who guarded him to leap back even though their&#10;prisoner&#39;s arms were securely bound behind him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With raised spears they encircled him as for a moment longer he&#10;stood listening. Faintly from the distance came another, an&#10;answering cry, and Tarzan of the Apes, satisfied, turned and&#10;quietly pursued his way toward the hut where he was to be&#10;imprisoned.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The afternoon wore on. From the surrounding village the ape-man&#10;heard the bustle of preparation for the feast. Through the doorway&#10;of the hut he saw the women laying the cooking fires and filling&#10;their earthen caldrons with water; but above it all his ears were&#10;bent across the jungle in eager listening for the coming of&#10;Tantor.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Even Tarzan but half believed that he would come. He knew Tantor&#10;even better than Tantor knew himself. He knew the timid heart which&#10;lay in the giant body. He knew the panic of terror which the scent&#10;of the Gomangani inspired within that savage breast, and as night&#10;drew on, hope died within his heart and in the stoic calm of the&#10;wild beast which he was, he resigned himself to meet the fate which&#10;awaited him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;All afternoon he had been working, working, working with the&#10;bonds that held his wrists. Very slowly they were giving. He might&#10;free his hands before they came to lead him out to be butchered,&#10;and if he did&#8212;Tarzan licked his lips in anticipation, and smiled a&#10;cold, grim smile. He could imagine the feel of soft flesh beneath&#10;his fingers and the sinking of his white teeth into the throats of&#10;his foemen. He would let them taste his wrath before they&#10;overpowered him!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At last they came&#8212;painted, befeathered warriors&#8212;even more&#10;hideous than nature had intended them. They came and pushed him&#10;into the open, where his appearance was greeted by wild shouts from&#10;the assembled villagers.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;To the stake they led him, and as they pushed him roughly&#10;against it preparatory to binding him there securely for the dance&#10;of death that would presently encircle him, Tarzan tensed his&#10;mighty thews and with a single, powerful wrench parted the loosened&#10;thongs which had secured his hands. Like thought, for quickness, he&#10;leaped forward among the warriors nearest him. A blow sent one to&#10;earth, as, growling and snarling, the beast-man leaped upon the&#10;breast of another. His fangs were buried instantly in the jugular&#10;of his adversary and then a half hundred black men had leaped upon&#10;him and borne him to earth.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Striking, clawing, and snapping, the ape-man fought&#8212; fought as&#10;his foster people had taught him to fight&#8212;fought like a wild beast&#10;cornered. His strength, his agility, his courage, and his&#10;intelligence rendered him easily a match for half a dozen black men&#10;in a hand-to-hand struggle, but not even Tarzan of the Apes could&#10;hope to successfully cope with half a hundred.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Slowly they were overpowering him, though a score of them bled&#10;from ugly wounds, and two lay very still beneath the trampling&#10;feet, and the rolling bodies of the contestants.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Overpower him they might, but could they keep him overpowered&#10;while they bound him? A half hour of desperate endeavor convinced&#10;them that they could not, and so Mbonga, who, like all good rulers,&#10;had circled in the safety of the background, called to one to work&#10;his way in and spear the victim. Gradually, through the milling,&#10;battling men, the warrior approached the object of his quest.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He stood with poised spear above his head waiting for the&#10;instant that would expose a vulnerable part of the ape-man&#39;s body&#10;and still not endanger one of the blacks. Closer and closer he&#10;edged about, following the movements of the twisting, scuffling&#10;combatants. The growls of the ape-man sent cold chills up the&#10;warrior&#39;s spine, causing him to go carefully lest he miss at the&#10;first cast and lay himself open to an attack from those merciless&#10;teeth and mighty hands.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At last he found an opening. Higher he raised his spear, tensing&#10;his muscles, rolling beneath his glistening, ebon hide, and then&#10;from the jungle just beyond the palisade came a thunderous&#10;crashing. The spear-hand paused, the black cast a quick glance in&#10;the direction of the disturbance, as did the others of the blacks&#10;who were not occupied with the subjugation of the ape-man.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In the glare of the fires they saw a huge bulk topping the&#10;barrier. They saw the palisade belly and sway inward. They saw it&#10;burst as though built of straws, and an instant later Tantor, the&#10;elephant, thundered down upon them.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;To right and left the blacks fled, screaming in terror. Some who&#10;hovered upon the verge of the strife with Tarzan heard and made&#10;good their escape, but a half dozen there were so wrapt in the&#10;blood-madness of battle that they failed to note the approach of&#10;the giant tusker.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Upon these Tantor charged, trumpeting furiously. Above them he&#10;stopped, his sensitive trunk weaving among them, and there, at the&#10;bottom, he found Tarzan, bloody, but still battling.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A warrior turned his eyes upward from the melee. Above him&#10;towered the gigantic bulk of the pachyderm, the little eyes&#10;flashing with the reflected light of the fires&#8212;wicked, frightful,&#10;terrifying. The warrior screamed, and as he screamed, the sinuous&#10;trunk encircled him, lifted him high above the ground, and hurled&#10;him far after the fleeing crowd.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Another and another Tantor wrenched from the body of the&#10;ape-man, throwing them to right and to left, where they lay either&#10;moaning or very quiet, as death came slowly or at once.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At a distance Mbonga rallied his warriors. His greedy eyes had&#10;noted the great ivory tusks of the bull. The first panic of terror&#10;relieved, he urged his men forward to attack with their heavy&#10;elephant spears; but as they came, Tantor swung Tarzan to his broad&#10;head, and, wheeling, lumbered off into the jungle through the great&#10;rent he had made in the palisade.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Elephant hunters may be right when they aver that this animal&#10;would not have rendered such service to a man, but to Tantor,&#10;Tarzan was not a man&#8212;he was but a fellow jungle beast.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And so it was that Tantor, the elephant, discharged an&#10;obligation to Tarzan of the Apes, cementing even more closely the&#10;friendship that had existed between them since Tarzan as a little,&#10;brown boy rode upon Tantor&#39;s huge back through the moonlit jungle&#10;beneath the equatorial stars.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 15, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/943')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Fight for the Balu'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;TEEKA HAD BECOME a mother. Tarzan of the Apes was intensely&#10;interested, much more so, in fact, than Taug, the father. Tarzan&#10;was very fond of Teeka. Even the cares of prospective motherhood&#10;had not entirely quenched the fires of carefree youth, and Teeka&#10;had remained a good-natured playmate even at an age when other shes&#10;of the tribe of Kerchak had assumed the sullen dignity of maturity.&#10;She yet retained her childish delight in the primitive games of tag&#10;and hide-and-go-seek which Tarzan&#39;s fertile man-mind had&#10;evolved.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;To play tag through the tree tops is an exciting and inspiring&#10;pastime. Tarzan delighted in it, but the bulls of his childhood had&#10;long since abandoned such childish practices. Teeka, though, had&#10;been keen for it always until shortly before the baby came; but&#10;with the advent of her first-born, even Teeka changed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The evidence of the change surprised and hurt Tarzan&#10;immeasurably. One morning he saw Teeka squatted upon a low branch&#10;hugging something very close to her hairy breast&#8212; a wee something&#10;which squirmed and wriggled. Tarzan approached filled with the&#10;curiosity which is common to all creatures endowed with brains&#10;which have progressed beyond the microscopic stage.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Teeka rolled her eyes in his direction and strained the&#10;squirming mite still closer to her. Tarzan came nearer. Teeka drew&#10;away and bared her fangs. Tarzan was nonplussed. In all his&#10;experiences with Teeka, never before had she bared fangs at him&#10;other than in play; but today she did not look playful. Tarzan ran&#10;his brown fingers through his thick, black hair, cocked his head&#10;upon one side, and stared. Then he edged a bit nearer, craning his&#10;neck to have a better look at the thing which Teeka cuddled.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Again Teeka drew back her upper lip in a warning snarl. Tarzan&#10;reached forth a hand, cautiously, to touch the thing which Teeka&#10;held, and Teeka, with a hideous growl, turned suddenly upon him.&#10;Her teeth sank into the flesh of his forearm before the ape-man&#10;could snatch it away, and she pursued him for a short distance as&#10;he retreated incontinently through the trees; but Teeka, carrying&#10;her baby, could not overtake him. At a safe distance Tarzan stopped&#10;and turned to regard his erstwhile play-fellow in unconcealed&#10;astonishment. What had happened to so alter the gentle Teeka? She&#10;had so covered the thing in her arms that Tarzan had not yet been&#10;able to recognize it for what it was; but now, as she turned from&#10;the pursuit of him, he saw it. Through his pain and chagrin he&#10;smiled, for Tarzan had seen young ape mothers before. In a few days&#10;she would be less suspicious. Still Tarzan was hurt; it was not&#10;right that Teeka, of all others, should fear him. Why, not for the&#10;world would he harm her, or her balu, which is the ape word for&#10;baby.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And now, above the pain of his injured arm and the hurt to his&#10;pride, rose a still stronger desire to come close and inspect the&#10;new-born son of Taug. Possibly you will wonder that Tarzan of the&#10;Apes, mighty fighter that he was, should have fled before the&#10;irritable attack of a she, or that he should hesitate to return for&#10;the satisfaction of his curiosity when with ease he might have&#10;vanquished the weakened mother of the new-born cub; but you need&#10;not wonder. Were you an ape, you would know that only a bull in the&#10;throes of madness will turn upon a female other than to gently&#10;chastise her, with the occasional exception of the individual whom&#10;we find exemplified among our own kind, and who delights in beating&#10;up his better half because she happens to be smaller and weaker&#10;than he.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan again came toward the young mother&#8212;warily and with his&#10;line of retreat safely open. Again Teeka growled ferociously.&#10;Tarzan expostulated.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Tarzan of the Apes will not harm Teeka&#39;s balu,&#34; he said. &#34;Let&#10;me see it.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Go away!&#34; commanded Teeka. &#34;Go away, or I will kill you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Let me see it,&#34; urged Tarzan.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Go away,&#34; reiterated the she-ape. &#34;Here comes Taug. He will&#10;make you go away. Taug will kill you. This is Taug&#39;s balu.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A savage growl close behind him apprised Tarzan of the nearness&#10;of Taug, and the fact that the bull had heard the warnings and&#10;threats of his mate and was coming to her succor.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now Taug, as well as Teeka, had been Tarzan&#39;s play-fellow while&#10;the bull was still young enough to wish to play. Once Tarzan had&#10;saved Taug&#39;s life; but the memory of an ape is not overlong, nor&#10;would gratitude rise above the parental instinct. Tarzan and Taug&#10;had once measured strength, and Tarzan had been victorious. That&#10;fact Taug could be depended upon still to remember; but even so, he&#10;might readily face another defeat for his first-born&#8212;if he chanced&#10;to be in the proper mood.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;From his hideous growls, which now rose in strength and volume,&#10;he seemed to be in quite the mood. Now Tarzan felt no fear of Taug,&#10;nor did the unwritten law of the jungle demand that he should flee&#10;from battle with any male, unless he cared to from purely personal&#10;reasons. But Tarzan liked Taug. He had no grudge against him, and&#10;his man-mind told him what the mind of an ape would never have&#10;deduced&#8212; that Taug&#39;s attitude in no sense indicated hatred. It was&#10;but the instinctive urge of the male to protect its offspring and&#10;its mate.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan had no desire to battle with Taug, nor did the blood of&#10;his English ancestors relish the thought of flight, yet when the&#10;bull charged, Tarzan leaped nimbly to one side, and thus&#10;encouraged, Taug wheeled and rushed again madly to the attack.&#10;Perhaps the memory of a past defeat at Tarzan&#39;s hands goaded him.&#10;Perhaps the fact that Teeka sat there watching him aroused a desire&#10;to vanquish the ape-man before her eyes, for in the breast of every&#10;jungle male lurks a vast egotism which finds expression in the&#10;performance of deeds of derring-do before an audience of the&#10;opposite sex.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At the ape-man&#39;s side swung his long grass rope&#8212;the play-thing&#10;of yesterday, the weapon of today&#8212;and as Taug charged the second&#10;time, Tarzan slipped the coils over his head and deftly shook out&#10;the sliding noose as he again nimbly eluded the ungainly beast.&#10;Before the ape could turn again, Tarzan had fled far aloft among&#10;the branches of the upper terrace.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Taug, now wrought to a frenzy of real rage, followed him. Teeka&#10;peered upward at them. It was difficult to say whether she was&#10;interested. Taug could not climb as rapidly as Tarzan, so the&#10;latter reached the high levels to which the heavy ape dared not&#10;follow before the former overtook him. There he halted and looked&#10;down upon his pursuer, making faces at him and calling him such&#10;choice names as occurred to the fertile man-brain. Then, when he&#10;had worked Taug to such a pitch of foaming rage that the great bull&#10;fairly danced upon the bending limb beneath him, Tarzan&#39;s hand shot&#10;suddenly outward, a widening noose dropped swiftly through the air,&#10;there was a quick jerk as it settled about Taug, falling to his&#10;knees, a jerk that tightened it securely about the hairy legs of&#10;the anthropoid.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Taug, slow of wit, realized too late the intention of his&#10;tormentor. He scrambled to escape, but the ape-man gave the rope a&#10;tremendous jerk that pulled Taug from his perch, and a moment&#10;later, growling hideously, the ape hung head downward thirty feet&#10;above the ground.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan secured the rope to a stout limb and descended to a point&#10;close to Taug.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Taug,&#34; he said, &#34;you are as stupid as Buto, the rhinoceros. Now&#10;you may hang here until you get a little sense in your thick head.&#10;You may hang here and watch while I go and talk with Teeka.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Taug blustered and threatened, but Tarzan only grinned at him as&#10;he dropped lightly to the lower levels. Here he again approached&#10;Teeka only to be again greeted with bared fangs and menacing&#10;growls. He sought to placate her; he urged his friendly intentions,&#10;and craned his neck to have a look at Teeka&#39;s balu; but the she-ape&#10;was not to be persuaded that he meant other than harm to her little&#10;one. Her motherhood was still so new that reason was yet&#10;subservient to instinct.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Realizing the futility of attempting to catch and chastise&#10;Tarzan, Teeka sought to escape him. She dropped to the ground and&#10;lumbered across the little clearing about which the apes of the&#10;tribe were disposed in rest or in the search of food, and presently&#10;Tarzan abandoned his attempts to persuade her to permit a close&#10;examination of the balu. The ape-man would have liked to handle the&#10;tiny thing. The very sight of it awakened in his breast a strange&#10;yearning. He wished to cuddle and fondle the grotesque little&#10;ape-thing. It was Teeka&#39;s balu and Tarzan had once lavished his&#10;young affections upon Teeka.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But now his attention was diverted by the voice of Taug. The&#10;threats that had filled the ape&#39;s mouth had turned to pleas. The&#10;tightening noose was stopping the circulation of the blood in his&#10;legs&#8212;he was beginning to suffer. Several apes sat near him highly&#10;interested in his predicament. They made uncomplimentary remarks&#10;about him, for each of them had felt the weight of Taug&#39;s mighty&#10;hands and the strength of his great jaws. They were enjoying&#10;revenge.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Teeka, seeing that Tarzan had turned back toward the trees, had&#10;halted in the center of the clearing, and there she sat hugging her&#10;balu and casting suspicious glances here and there. With the coming&#10;of the balu, Teeka&#39;s care-free world had suddenly become peopled&#10;with innumerable enemies. She saw an implacable foe in Tarzan,&#10;always heretofore her best friend. Even poor old Mumga, half blind&#10;and almost entirely toothless, searching patiently for grubworms&#10;beneath a fallen log, represented to her a malignant spirit&#10;thirsting for the blood of little balus.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And while Teeka guarded suspiciously against harm, where there&#10;was no harm, she failed to note two baleful, yellow-green eyes&#10;staring fixedly at her from behind a clump of bushes at the&#10;opposite side of the clearing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Hollow from hunger, Sheeta, the panther, glared greedily at the&#10;tempting meat so close at hand, but the sight of the great bulls&#10;beyond gave him pause.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Ah, if the she-ape with her balu would but come just a trifle&#10;nearer! A quick spring and he would be upon them and away again&#10;with his meat before the bulls could prevent.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The tip of his tawny tail moved in spasmodic little jerks; his&#10;lower jaw hung low, exposing a red tongue and yellow fangs. But all&#10;this Teeka did not see, nor did any other of the apes who were&#10;feeding or resting about her. Nor did Tarzan or the apes in the&#10;trees.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Hearing the abuse which the bulls were pouring upon the helpless&#10;Taug, Tarzan clambered quickly among them. One was edging closer&#10;and leaning far out in an effort to reach the dangling ape. He had&#10;worked himself into quite a fury through recollection of the last&#10;occasion upon which Taug had mauled him, and now he was bent upon&#10;revenge. Once he had grasped the swinging ape, he would quickly&#10;have drawn him within reach of his jaws. Tarzan saw and was wroth.&#10;He loved a fair fight, but the thing which this ape contemplated&#10;revolted him. Already a hairy hand had clutched the helpless Taug&#10;when, with an angry growl of protest, Tarzan leaped to the branch&#10;at the attacking ape&#39;s side, and with a single mighty cuff, swept&#10;him from his perch.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Surprised and enraged, the bull clutched madly for support as he&#10;toppled sidewise, and then with an agile movement succeeded in&#10;projecting himself toward another limb a few feet below. Here he&#10;found a hand-hold, quickly righted himself, and as quickly&#10;clambered upward to be revenged upon Tarzan, but the ape-man was&#10;otherwise engaged and did not wish to be interrupted. He was&#10;explaining again to Taug the depths of the latter&#39;s abysmal&#10;ignorance, and pointing out how much greater and mightier was&#10;Tarzan of the Apes than Taug or any other ape.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In the end he would release Taug, but not until Taug was fully&#10;acquainted with his own inferiority. And then the maddened bull&#10;came from beneath, and instantly Tarzan was transformed from a&#10;good-natured, teasing youth into a snarling, savage beast. Along&#10;his scalp the hair bristled: his upper lip drew back that his&#10;fighting fangs might be uncovered and ready. He did not wait for&#10;the bull to reach him, for something in the appearance or the voice&#10;of the attacker aroused within the ape-man a feeling of belligerent&#10;antagonism that would not be denied. With a scream that carried no&#10;human note, Tarzan leaped straight at the throat of the&#10;attacker.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The impetuosity of this act and the weight and momentum of his&#10;body carried the bull backward, clutching and clawing for support,&#10;down through the leafy branches of the tree. For fifteen feet the&#10;two fell, Tarzan&#39;s teeth buried in the jugular of his opponent,&#10;when a stout branch stopped their descent. The bull struck full&#10;upon the small of his back across the limb, hung there for a moment&#10;with the ape-man still upon his breast, and then toppled over&#10;toward the ground.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan had felt the instantaneous relaxation of the body beneath&#10;him after the heavy impact with the tree limb, and as the other&#10;turned completely over and started again upon its fall toward the&#10;ground, he reached forth a hand and caught the branch in time to&#10;stay his own descent, while the ape dropped like a plummet to the&#10;foot of the tree.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan looked downward for a moment upon the still form of his&#10;late antagonist, then he rose to his full height, swelled his deep&#10;chest, smote upon it with his clenched fist and roared out the&#10;uncanny challenge of the victorious bull ape.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Even Sheeta, the panther, crouched for a spring at the edge of&#10;the little clearing, moved uneasily as the mighty voice sent its&#10;weird cry reverberating through the jungle. To right and left,&#10;nervously, glanced Sheeta, as though assuring himself that the way&#10;of escape lay ready at hand.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I am Tarzan of the Apes,&#34; boasted the ape-man; &#34;mighty hunter,&#10;mighty fighter! None in all the jungle so great as Tarzan.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then he made his way back in the direction of Taug. Teeka had&#10;watched the happenings in the tree. She had even placed her&#10;precious balu upon the soft grasses and come a little nearer that&#10;she might better witness all that was passing in the branches above&#10;her. In her heart of hearts did she still esteem the smooth-skinned&#10;Tarzan? Did her savage breast swell with pride as she witnessed his&#10;victory over the ape? You will have to ask Teeka.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And Sheeta, the panther, saw that the she-ape had left her cub&#10;alone among the grasses. He moved his tail again, as though this&#10;closest approximation of lashing in which he dared indulge might&#10;stimulate his momentarily waned courage. The cry of the victorious&#10;ape-man still held his nerves beneath its spell. It would be&#10;several minutes before he again could bring himself to the point of&#10;charging into view of the giant anthropoids.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And as he regathered his forces, Tarzan reached Taug&#39;s side, and&#10;then clambering higher up to the point where the end of the grass&#10;rope was made fast, he unloosed it and lowered the ape slowly&#10;downward, swinging him in until the clutching hands fastened upon a&#10;limb.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Quickly Taug drew himself to a position of safety and shook off&#10;the noose. In his rage-maddened heart was no room for gratitude to&#10;the ape-man. He recalled only the fact that Tarzan had laid this&#10;painful indignity upon him. He would be revenged, but just at&#10;present his legs were so numb and his head so dizzy that he must&#10;postpone the gratification of his vengeance.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan was coiling his rope the while he lectured Taug on the&#10;futility of pitting his poor powers, physical and intellectual,&#10;against those of his betters. Teeka had come close beneath the tree&#10;and was peering upward. Sheeta was worming his way stealthily&#10;forward, his belly close to the ground. In another moment he would&#10;be clear of the underbrush and ready for the rapid charge and the&#10;quick retreat that would end the brief existence of Teeka&#39;s&#10;balu.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then Tarzan chanced to look up and across the clearing.&#10;Instantly his attitude of good-natured bantering and pompous&#10;boastfulness dropped from him. Silently and swiftly he shot&#10;downward toward the ground. Teeka, seeing him coming, and thinking&#10;that he was after her or her balu, bristled and prepared to fight.&#10;But Tarzan sped by her, and as he went, her eyes followed him and&#10;she saw the cause of his sudden descent and his rapid charge across&#10;the clearing. There in full sight now was Sheeta, the panther,&#10;stalking slowly toward the tiny, wriggling balu which lay among the&#10;grasses many yards away.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Teeka gave voice to a shrill scream of terror and of warning as&#10;she dashed after the ape-man. Sheeta saw Tarzan coming. He saw the&#10;she-ape&#39;s cub before him, and he thought that this other was bent&#10;upon robbing him of his prey. With an angry growl, he charged.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Taug, warned by Teeka&#39;s cry, came lumbering down to her&#10;assistance. Several other bulls, growling and barking, closed in&#10;toward the clearing, but they were all much farther from the balu&#10;and the panther than was Tarzan of the Apes, so it was that Sheeta&#10;and the ape-man reached Teeka&#39;s little one almost simultaneously;&#10;and there they stood, one upon either side of it, baring their&#10;fangs and snarling at each other over the little creature.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Sheeta was afraid to seize the balu, for thus he would give the&#10;ape-man an opening for attack; and for the same reason Tarzan&#10;hesitated to snatch the panther&#39;s prey out of harm&#39;s way, for had&#10;he stooped to accomplish this, the great beast would have been upon&#10;him in an instant. Thus they stood while Teeka came across the&#10;clearing, going more slowly as she neared the panther, for even her&#10;mother love could scarce overcome her instinctive terror of this&#10;natural enemy of her kind.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Behind her came Taug, warily and with many pauses and much&#10;bluster, and still behind him came other bulls, snarling&#10;ferociously and uttering their uncanny challenges. Sheeta&#39;s&#10;yellow-green eyes glared terribly at Tarzan, and past Tarzan they&#10;shot brief glances at the apes of Kerchak advancing upon him.&#10;Discretion prompted him to turn and flee, but hunger and the close&#10;proximity of the tempting morsel in the grass before him urged him&#10;to remain. He reached forth a paw toward Teeka&#39;s balu, and as he&#10;did so, with a savage guttural, Tarzan of the Apes was upon&#10;him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The panther reared to meet the ape-man&#39;s attack. He swung a&#10;frightful raking blow for Tarzan that would have wiped his face&#10;away had it landed, but it did not land, for Tarzan ducked beneath&#10;it and closed, his long knife ready in one strong hand&#8212;the knife of&#10;his dead father, of the father he never had known.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Instantly the balu was forgotten by Sheeta, the panther. He now&#10;thought only of tearing to ribbons with his powerful talons the&#10;flesh of his antagonist, of burying his long, yellow fangs in the&#10;soft, smooth hide of the ape-man, but Tarzan had fought before with&#10;clawed creatures of the jungle. Before now he had battled with&#10;fanged monsters, nor always had he come away unscathed. He knew the&#10;risk that he ran, but Tarzan of the Apes, inured to the sight of&#10;suffering and death, shrank from neither, for he feared&#10;neither.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The instant that he dodged beneath Sheeta&#39;s blow, he leaped to&#10;the beast&#39;s rear and then full upon the tawny back, burying his&#10;teeth in Sheeta&#39;s neck and the fingers of one hand in the fur at&#10;the throat, and with the other hand he drove his blade into&#10;Sheeta&#39;s side.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Over and over upon the grass rolled Sheeta, growling and&#10;screaming, clawing and biting, in a mad effort to dislodge his&#10;antagonist or get some portion of his body within range of teeth or&#10;talons.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As Tarzan leaped to close quarters with the panther, Teeka had&#10;run quickly in and snatched up her balu. Now she sat upon a high&#10;branch, safe out of harm&#39;s way, cuddling the little thing close to&#10;her hairy breast, the while her savage little eyes bored down upon&#10;the contestants in the clearing, and her ferocious voice urged Taug&#10;and the other bulls to leap into the melee.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Thus goaded the bulls came closer, redoubling their hideous&#10;clamor; but Sheeta was already sufficiently engaged&#8212; he did not&#10;even hear them. Once he succeeded in partially dislodging the&#10;ape-man from his back, so that Tarzan swung for an instant in front&#10;of those awful talons, and in the brief instant before he could&#10;regain his former hold, a raking blow from a hind paw laid open one&#10;leg from hip to knee.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was the sight and smell of this blood, possibly, which&#10;wrought upon the encircling apes; but it was Taug who really was&#10;responsible for the thing they did.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Taug, but a moment before filled with rage toward Tarzan of the&#10;Apes, stood close to the battling pair, his red-rimmed, wicked&#10;little eyes glaring at them. What was passing in his savage brain?&#10;Did he gloat over the unenviable position of his recent tormentor?&#10;Did he long to see Sheeta&#39;s great fangs sink into the soft throat&#10;of the ape-man? Or did he realize the courageous unselfishness that&#10;had prompted Tarzan to rush to the rescue and imperil his life for&#10;Teeka&#39;s balu&#8212;for Taug&#39;s little balu? Is gratitude a possession of&#10;man only, or do the lower orders know it also?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With the spilling of Tarzan&#39;s blood, Taug answered these&#10;questions. With all the weight of his great body he leaped,&#10;hideously growling, upon Sheeta. His long fighting fangs buried&#10;themselves in the white throat. His powerful arms beat and clawed&#10;at the soft fur until it flew upward in the jungle breeze.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And with Taug&#39;s example before them the other bulls charged,&#10;burying Sheeta beneath rending fangs and filling all the forest&#10;with the wild din of their battle cries.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Ah! but it was a wondrous and inspiring sight&#8212;this battle of the&#10;primordial apes and the great, white ape-man with their ancestral&#10;foe, Sheeta, the panther.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In frenzied excitement, Teeka fairly danced upon the limb which&#10;swayed beneath her great weight as she urged on the males of her&#10;people, and Thaka, and Mumga, and Kamma, with the other shes of the&#10;tribe of Kerchak, added their shrill cries or fierce barkings to&#10;the pandemonium which now reigned within the jungle.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Bitten and biting, tearing and torn, Sheeta battled for his&#10;life; but the odds were against him. Even Numa, the lion, would&#10;have hesitated to have attacked an equal number of the great bulls&#10;of the tribe of Kerchak, and now, a half mile away, hearing the&#10;sounds of the terrific battle, the king of beasts rose uneasily&#10;from his midday slumber and slunk off farther into the jungle.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Presently Sheeta&#39;s torn and bloody body ceased its titanic&#10;struggles. It stiffened spasmodically, twitched and was still, yet&#10;the bulls continued to lacerate it until the beautiful coat was&#10;torn to shreds. At last they desisted from sheer physical&#10;weariness, and then from the tangle of bloody bodies rose a crimson&#10;giant, straight as an arrow.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He placed a foot upon the dead body of the panther, and lifting&#10;his blood-stained face to the blue of the equatorial heavens, gave&#10;voice to the horrid victory cry of the bull ape.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;One by one his hairy fellows of the tribe of Kerchak followed&#10;his example. The shes came down from their perches of safety and&#10;struck and reviled the dead body of Sheeta. The young apes refought&#10;the battle in mimicry of their mighty elders.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Teeka was quite close to Tarzan. He turned and saw her with the&#10;balu hugged close to her hairy breast, and put out his hands to&#10;take the little one, expecting that Teeka would bare her fangs and&#10;spring upon him; but instead she placed the balu in his arms, and&#10;coming nearer, licked his frightful wounds.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And presently Taug, who had escaped with only a few scratches,&#10;came and squatted beside Tarzan and watched him as he played with&#10;the little balu, and at last he too leaned over and helped Teeka&#10;with the cleansing and the healing of the ape-man&#39;s hurts.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 15, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/943')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The God of Tarzan'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;AMONG THE BOOKS of his dead father in the little cabin by the&#10;land-locked harbor, Tarzan of the Apes found many things to puzzle&#10;his young head. By much labor and through the medium of infinite&#10;patience as well, he had, without assistance, discovered the&#10;purpose of the little bugs which ran riot upon the printed pages.&#10;He had learned that in the many combinations in which he found them&#10;they spoke in a silent language, spoke in a strange tongue, spoke&#10;of wonderful things which a little ape-boy could not by any chance&#10;fully understand, arousing his curiosity, stimulating his&#10;imagination and filling his soul with a mighty longing for further&#10;knowledge.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A dictionary had proven itself a wonderful storehouse of&#10;information, when, after several years of tireless endeavor, he had&#10;solved the mystery of its purpose and the manner of its use. He had&#10;learned to make a species of game out of it, following up the spoor&#10;of a new thought through the mazes of the many definitions which&#10;each new word required him to consult. It was like following a&#10;quarry through the jungle&#8212; it was hunting, and Tarzan of the Apes&#10;was an indefatigable huntsman.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There were, of course, certain words which aroused his curiosity&#10;to a greater extent than others, words which, for one reason or&#10;another, excited his imagination. There was one, for example, the&#10;meaning of which was rather difficult to grasp. It was the word&#10;GOD. Tarzan first had been attracted to it by the fact that it was&#10;very short and that it commenced with a larger g-bug than those&#10;about it&#8212;a male g-bug it was to Tarzan, the lower-case letters&#10;being females. Another fact which attracted him to this word was&#10;the number of he-bugs which figured in its definition&#8212;Supreme&#10;Deity, Creator or Upholder of the Universe. This must be a very&#10;important word indeed, he would have to look into it, and he did,&#10;though it still baffled him after many months of thought and&#10;study.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;However, Tarzan counted no time wasted which he devoted to these&#10;strange hunting expeditions into the game preserves of knowledge,&#10;for each word and each definition led on and on into strange&#10;places, into new worlds where, with increasing frequency, he met&#10;old, familiar faces. And always he added to his store of&#10;knowledge.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But of the meaning of GOD he was yet in doubt. Once he thought&#10;he had grasped it&#8212;that God was a mighty chieftain, king of all the&#10;Mangani. He was not quite sure, however, since that would mean that&#10;God was mightier than Tarzan&#8212; a point which Tarzan of the Apes, who&#10;acknowledged no equal in the jungle, was loath to concede.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But in all the books he had there was no picture of God, though&#10;he found much to confirm his belief that God was a great, an&#10;all-powerful individual. He saw pictures of places where God was&#10;worshiped; but never any sign of God. Finally he began to wonder if&#10;God were not of a different form than he, and at last he determined&#10;to set out in search of Him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He commenced by questioning Mumga, who was very old and had seen&#10;many strange things in her long life; but Mumga, being an ape, had&#10;a faculty for recalling the trivial. That time when Gunto mistook a&#10;sting-bug for an edible beetle had made more impression upon Mumga&#10;than all the innumerable manifestations of the greatness of God&#10;which she had witnessed, and which, of course, she had not&#10;understood.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Numgo, overhearing Tarzan&#39;s questions, managed to wrest his&#10;attention long enough from the diversion of flea hunting to advance&#10;the theory that the power which made the lightning and the rain and&#10;the thunder came from Goro, the moon. He knew this, he said,&#10;because the Dum-Dum always was danced in the light of Goro. This&#10;reasoning, though entirely satisfactory to Numgo and Mumga, failed&#10;fully to convince Tarzan. However, it gave him a basis for further&#10;investigation along a new line. He would investigate the moon.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;That night he clambered to the loftiest pinnacle of the tallest&#10;jungle giant. The moon was full, a great, glorious, equatorial&#10;moon. The ape-man, upright upon a slender, swaying limb, raised his&#10;bronzed face to the silver orb. Now that he had clambered to the&#10;highest point within his reach, he discovered, to his surprise,&#10;that Goro was as far away as when he viewed him from the ground. He&#10;thought that Goro was attempting to elude him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Come, Goro!&#34; he cried, &#34;Tarzan of the Apes will not harm you!&#34;&#10;But still the moon held aloof.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Tell me,&#34; he continued, &#34;if you be the great king who sends&#10;Ara, the lightning; who makes the great noise and the mighty winds,&#10;and sends the waters down upon the jungle people when the days are&#10;dark and it is cold. Tell me, Goro, are you God?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Of course he did not pronounce God as you or I would pronounce&#10;His name, for Tarzan knew naught of the spoken language of his&#10;English forbears; but he had a name of his own invention for each&#10;of the little bugs which constituted the alphabet. Unlike the apes&#10;he was not satisfied merely to have a mental picture of the things&#10;he knew, he must have a word descriptive of each. In reading he&#10;grasped a word in its entirety; but when he spoke the words he had&#10;learned from the books of his father, he pronounced each according&#10;to the names he had given the various little bugs which occurred in&#10;it, usually giving the gender prefix for each.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Thus it was an imposing word which Tarzan made of GOD. The&#10;masculine prefix of the apes is BU, the feminine MU; g Tarzan had&#10;named LA, o he pronounced TU, and d was MO. So the word God evolved&#10;itself into BULAMUTUMUMO, or, in English, he-g-she-o-she-d.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Similarly he had arrived at a strange and wonderful spelling of&#10;his own name. Tarzan is derived from the two ape words TAR and ZAN,&#10;meaning white skin. It was given him by his foster mother, Kala,&#10;the great she-ape. When Tarzan first put it into the written&#10;language of his own people he had not yet chanced upon either WHITE&#10;or SKIN in the dictionary; but in a primer he had seen the picture&#10;of a little white boy and so he wrote his name BUMUDE-MUTOMURO, or&#10;he-boy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;To follow Tarzan&#39;s strange system of spelling would be laborious&#10;as well as futile, and so we shall in the future, as we have in the&#10;past, adhere to the more familiar forms of our grammar school&#10;copybooks. It would tire you to remember that DO meant b, TU o, and&#10;RO y, and that to say he-boy you must prefix the ape masculine&#10;gender sound BU before the entire word and the feminine gender&#10;sound MU before each of the lower-case letters which go to make up&#10;boy&#8212;it would tire you and it would bring me to the nineteenth hole&#10;several strokes under par.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And so Tarzan harangued the moon, and when Goro did not reply,&#10;Tarzan of the Apes waxed wroth. He swelled his giant chest and&#10;bared his fighting fangs, and hurled into the teeth of the dead&#10;satellite the challenge of the bull ape.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You are not Bulamutumumo,&#34; he cried. &#34;You are not king of the&#10;jungle folk. You are not so great as Tarzan, mighty fighter, mighty&#10;hunter. None there is so great as Tarzan. If there be a&#10;Bulamutumumo, Tarzan can kill him. Come down, Goro, great coward,&#10;and fight with Tarzan. Tarzan will kill you. I am Tarzan, the&#10;killer.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But the moon made no answer to the boasting of the ape-man, and&#10;when a cloud came and obscured her face, Tarzan thought that Goro&#10;was indeed afraid, and was hiding from him, so he came down out of&#10;the trees and awoke Numgo and told him how great was Tarzan&#8212;how he&#10;had frightened Goro out of the sky and made him tremble. Tarzan&#10;spoke of the moon as HE, for all things large or awe inspiring are&#10;male to the ape folk.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Numgo was not much impressed; but he was very sleepy, so he told&#10;Tarzan to go away and leave his betters alone.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But where shall I find God?&#34; insisted Tarzan. &#34;You are very&#10;old; if there is a God you must have seen Him. What does He look&#10;like? Where does He live?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I am God,&#34; replied Numgo. &#34;Now sleep and disturb me no&#10;more.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan looked at Numgo steadily for several minutes, his shapely&#10;head sank just a trifle between his great shoulders, his square&#10;chin shot forward and his short upper lip drew back, exposing his&#10;white teeth. Then, with a low growl he leaped upon the ape and&#10;buried his fangs in the other&#39;s hairy shoulder, clutching the great&#10;neck in his mighty fingers. Twice he shook the old ape, then he&#10;released his tooth-hold.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Are you God?&#34; he demanded.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No,&#34; wailed Numgo. &#34;I am only a poor, old ape. Leave me alone.&#10;Go ask the Gomangani where God is. They are hairless like yourself&#10;and very wise, too. They should know.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan released Numgo and turned away. The suggestion that he&#10;consult the blacks appealed to him, and though his relations with&#10;the people of Mbonga, the chief, were the antithesis of friendly,&#10;he could at least spy upon his hated enemies and discover if they&#10;had intercourse with God.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So it was that Tarzan set forth through the trees toward the&#10;village of the blacks, all excitement at the prospect of&#10;discovering the Supreme Being, the Creator of all things. As he&#10;traveled he reviewed, mentally, his armament&#8212;the condition of his&#10;hunting knife, the number of his arrows, the newness of the gut&#10;which strung his bow&#8212;he hefted the war spear which had once been&#10;the pride of some black warrior of Mbonga&#39;s tribe.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;If he met God, Tarzan would be prepared. One could never tell&#10;whether a grass rope, a war spear, or a poisoned arrow would be&#10;most efficacious against an unfamiliar foe. Tarzan of the Apes was&#10;quite content&#8212;if God wished to fight, the ape-man had no doubt as&#10;to the outcome of the struggle. There were many questions Tarzan&#10;wished to put to the Creator of the Universe and so he hoped that&#10;God would not prove a belligerent God; but his experience of life&#10;and the ways of living things had taught him that any creature with&#10;the means for offense and defense was quite likely to provoke&#10;attack if in the proper mood.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was dark when Tarzan came to the village of Mbonga. As&#10;silently as the silent shadows of the night he sought his&#10;accustomed place among the branches of the great tree which&#10;overhung the palisade. Below him, in the village street, he saw men&#10;and women. The men were hideously painted&#8212;more hideously than&#10;usual. Among them moved a weird and grotesque figure, a tall figure&#10;that went upon the two legs of a man and yet had the head of a&#10;buffalo. A tail dangled to his ankles behind him, and in one hand&#10;he carried a zebra&#39;s tail while the other clutched a bunch of small&#10;arrows.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan was electrified. Could it be that chance had given him&#10;thus early an opportunity to look upon God? Surely this thing was&#10;neither man nor beast, so what could it be then other than the&#10;Creator of the Universe! The ape-man watched the every move of the&#10;strange creature. He saw the black men and women fall back at its&#10;approach as though they stood in terror of its mysterious&#10;powers.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Presently he discovered that the deity was speaking and that all&#10;listened in silence to his words. Tarzan was sure that none other&#10;than God could inspire such awe in the hearts of the Gomangani, or&#10;stop their mouths so effectually without recourse to arrows or&#10;spears. Tarzan had come to look with contempt upon the blacks,&#10;principally because of their garrulity. The small apes talked a&#10;great deal and ran away from an enemy. The big, old bulls of&#10;Kerchak talked but little and fought upon the slightest&#10;provocation. Numa, the lion, was not given to loquacity, yet of all&#10;the jungle folk there were few who fought more often than he.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan witnessed strange things that night, none of which he&#10;understood, and, perhaps because they were strange, he thought that&#10;they must have to do with the God he could not understand. He saw&#10;three youths receive their first war spears in a weird ceremony&#10;which the grotesque witch-doctor strove successfully to render&#10;uncanny and awesome.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Hugely interested, he watched the slashing of the three brown&#10;arms and the exchange of blood with Mbonga, the chief, in the rites&#10;of the ceremony of blood brotherhood. He saw the zebra&#39;s tail&#10;dipped into a caldron of water above which the witch-doctor had&#10;made magical passes the while he danced and leaped about it, and he&#10;saw the breasts and foreheads of each of the three novitiates&#10;sprinkled with the charmed liquid. Could the ape-man have known the&#10;purpose of this act, that it was intended to render the recipient&#10;invulnerable to the attacks of his enemies and fearless in the face&#10;of any danger, he would doubtless have leaped into the village&#10;street and appropriated the zebra&#39;s tail and a portion of the&#10;contents of the caldron.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But he did not know, and so he only wondered, not alone at what&#10;he saw but at the strange sensations which played up and down his&#10;naked spine, sensations induced, doubtless, by the same hypnotic&#10;influence which held the black spectators in tense awe upon the&#10;verge of a hysteric upheaval.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The longer Tarzan watched, the more convinced he became that his&#10;eyes were upon God, and with the conviction came determination to&#10;have word with the deity. With Tarzan of the Apes, to think was to&#10;act.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The people of Mbonga were keyed to the highest pitch of&#10;hysterical excitement. They needed little to release the&#10;accumulated pressure of static nerve force which the terrorizing&#10;mummery of the witch-doctor had induced.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A lion roared, suddenly and loud, close without the palisade.&#10;The blacks started nervously, dropping into utter silence as they&#10;listened for a repetition of that all-too-familiar and always&#10;terrorizing voice. Even the witch-doctor paused in the midst of an&#10;intricate step, remaining momentarily rigid and statuesque as he&#10;plumbed his cunning mind for a suggestion as how best he might take&#10;advantage of the condition of his audience and the timely&#10;interruption.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Already the evening had been vastly profitable to him. There&#10;would be three goats for the initiation of the three youths into&#10;full-fledged warriorship, and besides these he had received several&#10;gifts of grain and beads, together with a piece of copper wire from&#10;admiring and terrified members of his audience.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Numa&#39;s roar still reverberated along taut nerves when a woman&#39;s&#10;laugh, shrill and piercing, shattered the silence of the village.&#10;It was this moment that Tarzan chose to drop lightly from his tree&#10;into the village street. Fearless among his blood enemies he stood,&#10;taller by a full head than many of Mbonga&#39;s warriors, straight as&#10;their straightest arrow, muscled like Numa, the lion.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For a moment Tarzan stood looking straight at the witch-doctor.&#10;Every eye was upon him, yet no one had moved&#8212; a paralysis of terror&#10;held them, to be broken a moment later as the ape-man, with a toss&#10;of head, stepped straight toward the hideous figure beneath the&#10;buffalo head.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then the nerves of the blacks could stand no more. For months&#10;the terror of the strange, white, jungle god had been upon them.&#10;Their arrows had been stolen from the very center of the village;&#10;their warriors had been silently slain upon the jungle trails and&#10;their dead bodies dropped mysteriously and by night into the&#10;village street as from the heavens above.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;One or two there were who had glimpsed the strange figure of the&#10;new demon and it was from their oft-repeated descriptions that the&#10;entire village now recognized Tarzan as the author of many of their&#10;ills. Upon another occasion and by daylight, the warriors would&#10;doubtless have leaped to attack him, but at night, and this night&#10;of all others, when they were wrought to such a pitch of nervous&#10;dread by the uncanny artistry of their witch-doctor, they were&#10;helpless with terror. As one man they turned and fled, scattering&#10;for their huts, as Tarzan advanced. For a moment one and one only&#10;held his ground. It was the witch-doctor. More than half&#10;self-hypnotized into a belief in his own charlatanry he faced this&#10;new demon who threatened to undermine his ancient and lucrative&#10;profession.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Are you God?&#34; asked Tarzan.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The witch-doctor, having no idea of the meaning of the other&#39;s&#10;words, danced a few strange steps, leaped high in the air, turning&#10;completely around and alighting in a stooping posture with feet far&#10;outspread and head thrust out toward the ape-man. Thus he remained&#10;for an instant before he uttered a loud &#34;Boo!&#34; which was evidently&#10;intended to frighten Tarzan away; but in reality had no such&#10;effect.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan did not pause. He had set out to approach and examine God&#10;and nothing upon earth might now stay his feet. Seeing that his&#10;antics had no potency with the visitor, the witch-doctor tried some&#10;new medicine. Spitting upon the zebra&#39;s tail, which he still&#10;clutched in one hand, he made circles above it with the arrows in&#10;the other hand, meanwhile backing cautiously away from Tarzan and&#10;speaking confidentially to the bushy end of the tail.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;This medicine must be short medicine, however, for the creature,&#10;god or demon, was steadily closing up the distance which had&#10;separated them. The circles therefore were few and rapid, and when&#10;they were completed, the witch-doctor struck an attitude which was&#10;intended to be awe inspiring and waving the zebra&#39;s tail before&#10;him, drew an imaginary line between himself and Tarzan.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Beyond this line you cannot pass, for my medicine is strong&#10;medicine,&#34; he cried. &#34;Stop, or you will fall dead as your foot&#10;touches this spot. My mother was a voodoo, my father was a snake; I&#10;live upon lions&#39; hearts and the entrails of the panther; I eat&#10;young babies for breakfast and the demons of the jungle are my&#10;slaves. I am the most powerful witch-doctor in the world; I fear&#10;nothing, for I cannot die. I&#8212;&#34; But he got no further; instead he&#10;turned and fled as Tarzan of the Apes crossed the magical dead line&#10;and still lived.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As the witch-doctor ran, Tarzan almost lost his temper. This was&#10;no way for God to act, at least not in accordance with the&#10;conception Tarzan had come to have of God.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Come back!&#34; he cried. &#34;Come back, God, I will not harm you.&#34;&#10;But the witch-doctor was in full retreat by this time, stepping&#10;high as he leaped over cooking pots and the smoldering embers of&#10;small fires that had burned before the huts of villagers. Straight&#10;for his own hut ran the witch-doctor, terror-spurred to unwonted&#10;speed; but futile was his effort&#8212;the ape-man bore down upon him&#10;with the speed of Bara, the deer.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Just at the entrance to his hut the witch-doctor was overhauled.&#10;A heavy hand fell upon his shoulder to drag him back. It seized&#10;upon a portion of the buffalo hide, dragging the disguise from him.&#10;It was a naked black man that Tarzan saw dodge into the darkness of&#10;the hut&#39;s interior.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So this was what he had thought was God! Tarzan&#39;s lip curled in&#10;an angry snarl as he leaped into the hut after the terror-stricken&#10;witch-doctor. In the blackness within he found the man huddled at&#10;the far side and dragged him forth into the comparative lightness&#10;of the moonlit night.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The witch-doctor bit and scratched in an attempt to escape; but&#10;a few cuffs across the head brought him to a better realization of&#10;the futility of resistance. Beneath the moon Tarzan held the&#10;cringing figure upon its shaking feet.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;So you are God!&#34; he cried. &#34;If you be God, then Tarzan is&#10;greater than God,&#34; and so the ape-man thought. &#34;I am Tarzan,&#34; he&#10;shouted into the ear of the black. &#34;In all the jungle, or above it,&#10;or upon the running waters, or the sleeping waters, or upon the big&#10;water, or the little water, there is none so great as Tarzan.&#10;Tarzan is greater than the Mangani; he is greater than the&#10;Gomangani. With his own hands he has slain Numa, the lion, and&#10;Sheeta, the panther; there is none so great as Tarzan. Tarzan is&#10;greater than God. See!&#34; and with a sudden wrench he twisted the&#10;black&#39;s neck until the fellow shrieked in pain and then slumped to&#10;the earth in a swoon.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Placing his foot upon the neck of the fallen witch-doctor, the&#10;ape-man raised his face to the moon and uttered the long, shrill&#10;scream of the victorious bull ape. Then he stooped and snatched the&#10;zebra&#39;s tail from the nerveless fingers of the unconscious man and&#10;without a backward glance retraced his footsteps across the&#10;village.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;From several hut doorways frightened eyes watched him. Mbonga,&#10;the chief, was one of those who had seen what passed before the hut&#10;of the witch-doctor. Mbonga was greatly concerned. Wise old&#10;patriarch that he was, he never had more than half believed in&#10;witch-doctors, at least not since greater wisdom had come with age;&#10;but as a chief he was well convinced of the power of the&#10;witch-doctor as an arm of government, and often it was that Mbonga&#10;used the superstitious fears of his people to his own ends through&#10;the medium of the medicine-man.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mbonga and the witch-doctor had worked together and divided the&#10;spoils, and now the &#34;face&#34; of the witch-doctor would be lost&#10;forever if any saw what Mbonga had seen; nor would this generation&#10;again have as much faith in any future witch-doctor.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mbonga must do something to counteract the evil influence of the&#10;forest demon&#39;s victory over the witch-doctor. He raised his heavy&#10;spear and crept silently from his hut in the wake of the retreating&#10;ape-man. Down the village street walked Tarzan, as unconcerned and&#10;as deliberate as though only the friendly apes of Kerchak&#10;surrounded him instead of a village full of armed enemies.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Seeming only was the indifference of Tarzan, for alert and&#10;watchful was every well-trained sense. Mbonga, wily stalker of&#10;keen-eared jungle creatures, moved now in utter silence. Not even&#10;Bara, the deer, with his great ears could have guessed from any&#10;sound that Mbonga was near; but the black was not stalking Bara; he&#10;was stalking man, and so he sought only to avoid noise.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Closer and closer to the slowly moving ape-man he came. Now he&#10;raised his war spear, throwing his spear-hand far back above his&#10;right shoulder. Once and for all would Mbonga, the chief, rid&#10;himself and his people of the menace of this terrifying enemy. He&#10;would make no poor cast; he would take pains, and he would hurl his&#10;weapon with such great force as would finish the demon forever.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But Mbonga, sure as he thought himself, erred in his&#10;calculations. He might believe that he was stalking a man&#8212; he did&#10;not know, however, that it was a man with the delicate sense&#10;perception of the lower orders. Tarzan, when he had turned his back&#10;upon his enemies, had noted what Mbonga never would have thought of&#10;considering in the hunting of man&#8212;the wind. It was blowing in the&#10;same direction that Tarzan was proceeding, carrying to his delicate&#10;nostrils the odors which arose behind him. Thus it was that Tarzan&#10;knew that he was being followed, for even among the many stenches&#10;of an African village, the ape-man&#39;s uncanny faculty was equal to&#10;the task of differentiating one stench from another and locating&#10;with remarkable precision the source from whence it came.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He knew that a man was following him and coming closer, and his&#10;judgment warned him of the purpose of the stalker. When Mbonga,&#10;therefore, came within spear range of the ape-man, the latter&#10;suddenly wheeled upon him, so suddenly that the poised spear was&#10;shot a fraction of a second before Mbonga had intended. It went a&#10;trifle high and Tarzan stooped to let it pass over his head; then&#10;he sprang toward the chief. But Mbonga did not wait to receive him.&#10;Instead, he turned and fled for the dark doorway of the nearest&#10;hut, calling as he went for his warriors to fall upon the stranger&#10;and slay him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Well indeed might Mbonga scream for help, for Tarzan, young and&#10;fleet-footed, covered the distance between them in great leaps, at&#10;the speed of a charging lion. He was growling, too, not at all&#10;unlike Numa himself. Mbonga heard and his blood ran cold. He could&#10;feel the wool stiffen upon his pate and a prickly chill run up his&#10;spine, as though Death had come and run his cold finger along&#10;Mbonga&#39;s back.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Others heard, too, and saw, from the darkness of their huts&#8212;bold&#10;warriors, hideously painted, grasping heavy war spears in nerveless&#10;fingers. Against Numa, the lion, they would have charged&#10;fearlessly. Against many times their own number of black warriors&#10;would they have raced to the protection of their chief; but this&#10;weird jungle demon filled them with terror. There was nothing human&#10;in the bestial growls that rumbled up from his deep chest; there&#10;was nothing human in the bared fangs, or the catlike leaps.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mbonga&#39;s warriors were terrified&#8212;too terrified to leave the&#10;seeming security of their huts while they watched the beast-man&#10;spring full upon the back of their old chieftain.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mbonga went down with a scream of terror. He was too frightened&#10;even to attempt to defend himself. He just lay beneath his&#10;antagonist in a paralysis of fear, screaming at the top of his&#10;lungs. Tarzan half rose and kneeled above the black. He turned&#10;Mbonga over and looked him in the face, exposing the man&#39;s throat,&#10;then he drew his long, keen knife, the knife that John Clayton,&#10;Lord Greystoke, had brought from England many years before. He&#10;raised it close above Mbonga&#39;s neck. The old black whimpered with&#10;terror. He pleaded for his life in a tongue which Tarzan could not&#10;understand.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For the first time the ape-man had a close view of the chief. He&#10;saw an old man, a very old man with scrawny neck and wrinkled&#10;face&#8212;a dried, parchment-like face which resembled some of the&#10;little monkeys Tarzan knew so well. He saw the terror in the man&#39;s&#10;eyes&#8212;never before had Tarzan seen such terror in the eyes of any&#10;animal, or such a piteous appeal for mercy upon the face of any&#10;creature.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Something stayed the ape-man&#39;s hand for an instant. He wondered&#10;why it was that he hesitated to make the kill; never before had he&#10;thus delayed. The old man seemed to wither and shrink to a bag of&#10;puny bones beneath his eyes. So weak and helpless and&#10;terror-stricken he appeared that the ape-man was filled with a&#10;great contempt; but another sensation also claimed him&#8212;something&#10;new to Tarzan of the Apes in relation to an enemy. It was pity&#8212;pity&#10;for a poor, frightened, old man.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan rose and turned away, leaving Mbonga, the chief,&#10;unharmed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With head held high the ape-man walked through the village,&#10;swung himself into the branches of the tree which overhung the&#10;palisade and disappeared from the sight of the villagers.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;All the way back to the stamping ground of the apes, Tarzan&#10;sought for an explanation of the strange power which had stayed his&#10;hand and prevented him from slaying Mbonga. It was as though&#10;someone greater than he had commanded him to spare the life of the&#10;old man. Tarzan could not understand, for he could conceive of&#10;nothing, or no one, with the authority to dictate to him what he&#10;should do, or what he should refrain from doing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was late when Tarzan sought a swaying couch among the trees&#10;beneath which slept the apes of Kerchak, and he was still absorbed&#10;in the solution of his strange problem when he fell asleep.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The sun was well up in the heavens when he awoke. The apes were&#10;astir in search of food. Tarzan watched them lazily from above as&#10;they scratched in the rotting loam for bugs and beetles and&#10;grubworms, or sought among the branches of the trees for eggs and&#10;young birds, or luscious caterpillars.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;An orchid, dangling close beside his head, opened slowly,&#10;unfolding its delicate petals to the warmth and light of the sun&#10;which but recently had penetrated to its shady retreat. A thousand&#10;times had Tarzan of the Apes witnessed the beauteous miracle; but&#10;now it aroused a keener interest, for the ape-man was just&#10;commencing to ask himself questions about all the myriad wonders&#10;which heretofore he had but taken for granted.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;What made the flower open? What made it grow from a tiny bud to&#10;a full-blown bloom? Why was it at all? Why was he? Where did Numa,&#10;the lion, come from? Who planted the first tree? How did Goro get&#10;way up into the darkness of the night sky to cast his welcome light&#10;upon the fearsome nocturnal jungle? And the sun! Did the sun merely&#10;happen there?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Why were all the peoples of the jungle not trees? Why were the&#10;trees not something else? Why was Tarzan different from Taug, and&#10;Taug different from Bara, the deer, and Bara different from Sheeta,&#10;the panther, and why was not Sheeta like Buto, the rhinoceros?&#10;Where and how, anyway, did they all come from&#8212;the trees, the&#10;flowers, the insects, the countless creatures of the jungle?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Quite unexpectedly an idea popped into Tarzan&#39;s head. In&#10;following out the many ramifications of the dictionary definition&#10;of GOD he had come upon the word CREATE&#8212; &#34;to cause to come into&#10;existence; to form out of nothing.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan almost had arrived at something tangible when a distant&#10;wail startled him from his preoccupation into sensibility of the&#10;present and the real. The wail came from the jungle at some little&#10;distance from Tarzan&#39;s swaying couch. It was the wail of a tiny&#10;balu. Tarzan recognized it at once as the voice of Gazan, Teeka&#39;s&#10;baby. They had called it Gazan because its soft, baby hair had been&#10;unusually red, and GAZAN in the language of the great apes, means&#10;red skin.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The wail was immediately followed by a real scream of terror&#10;from the small lungs. Tarzan was electrified into instant action.&#10;Like an arrow from a bow he shot through the trees in the direction&#10;of the sound. Ahead of him he heard the savage snarling of an adult&#10;she-ape. It was Teeka to the rescue. The danger must be very real.&#10;Tarzan could tell that by the note of rage mingled with fear in the&#10;voice of the she.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Running along bending limbs, swinging from one tree to another,&#10;the ape-man raced through the middle terraces toward the sounds&#10;which now had risen in volume to deafening proportions. From all&#10;directions the apes of Kerchak were hurrying in response to the&#10;appeal in the tones of the balu and its mother, and as they came,&#10;their roars reverberated through the forest.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But Tarzan, swifter than his heavy fellows, distanced them all.&#10;It was he who was first upon the scene. What he saw sent a cold&#10;chill through his giant frame, for the enemy was the most hated and&#10;loathed of all the jungle creatures.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Twined in a great tree was Histah, the snake&#8212;huge, ponderous,&#10;slimy&#8212;and in the folds of its deadly embrace was Teeka&#39;s little&#10;balu, Gazan. Nothing in the jungle inspired within the breast of&#10;Tarzan so near a semblance to fear as did the hideous Histah. The&#10;apes, too, loathed the terrifying reptile and feared him even more&#10;than they did Sheeta, the panther, or Numa, the lion. Of all their&#10;enemies there was none they gave a wider berth than they gave&#10;Histah, the snake.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan knew that Teeka was peculiarly fearful of this silent,&#10;repulsive foe, and as the scene broke upon his vision, it was the&#10;action of Teeka which filled him with the greatest wonder, for at&#10;the moment that he saw her, the she-ape leaped upon the glistening&#10;body of the snake, and as the mighty folds encircled her as well as&#10;her offspring, she made no effort to escape, but instead grasped&#10;the writhing body in a futile effort to tear it from her screaming&#10;balu.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan knew all too well how deep-rooted was Teeka&#39;s terror of&#10;Histah. He scarce could believe the testimony of his own eyes then,&#10;when they told him that she had voluntarily rushed into that deadly&#10;embrace. Nor was Teeka&#39;s innate dread of the monster much greater&#10;than Tarzan&#39;s own. Never, willingly, had he touched a snake. Why,&#10;he could not say, for he would admit fear of nothing; nor was it&#10;fear, but rather an inherent repulsion bequeathed to him by many&#10;generations of civilized ancestors, and back of them, perhaps, by&#10;countless myriads of such as Teeka, in the breasts of each of which&#10;had lurked the same nameless terror of the slimy reptile.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Yet Tarzan did not hesitate more than had Teeka, but leaped upon&#10;Histah with all the speed and impetuosity that he would have shown&#10;had he been springing upon Bara, the deer, to make a kill for food.&#10;Thus beset the snake writhed and twisted horribly; but not for an&#10;instant did it loose its hold upon any of its intended victims, for&#10;it had included the ape-man in its cold embrace the minute that he&#10;had fallen upon it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Still clinging to the tree, the mighty reptile held the three as&#10;though they had been without weight, the while it sought to crush&#10;the life from them. Tarzan had drawn his knife and this he now&#10;plunged rapidly into the body of the enemy; but the encircling&#10;folds promised to sap his life before he had inflicted a death&#10;wound upon the snake. Yet on he fought, nor once did he seek to&#10;escape the horrid death that confronted him&#8212;his sole aim was to&#10;slay Histah and thus free Teeka and her balu.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The great, wide-gaping jaws of the snake turned and hovered&#10;above him. The elastic maw, which could accommodate a rabbit or a&#10;horned buck with equal facility, yawned for him; but Histah, in&#10;turning his attention upon the ape-man, brought his head within&#10;reach of Tarzan&#39;s blade. Instantly a brown hand leaped forth and&#10;seized the mottled neck, and another drove the heavy hunting knife&#10;to the hilt into the little brain.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Convulsively Histah shuddered and relaxed, tensed and relaxed&#10;again, whipping and striking with his great body; but no longer&#10;sentient or sensible. Histah was dead, but in his death throes he&#10;might easily dispatch a dozen apes or men.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Quickly Tarzan seized Teeka and dragged her from the loosened&#10;embrace, dropping her to the ground beneath, then he extricated the&#10;balu and tossed it to its mother. Still Histah whipped about,&#10;clinging to the ape-man; but after a dozen efforts Tarzan succeeded&#10;in wriggling free and leaping to the ground out of range of the&#10;mighty battering of the dying snake.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A circle of apes surrounded the scene of the battle; but the&#10;moment that Tarzan broke safely from the enemy they turned silently&#10;away to resume their interrupted feeding, and Teeka turned with&#10;them, apparently forgetful of all but her balu and the fact that&#10;when the interruption had occurred she just had discovered an&#10;ingeniously hidden nest containing three perfectly good eggs.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan, equally indifferent to a battle that was over, merely&#10;cast a parting glance at the still writhing body of Histah and&#10;wandered off toward the little pool which served to water the tribe&#10;at this point. Strangely, he did not give the victory cry over the&#10;vanquished Histah. Why, he could not have told you, other than that&#10;to him Histah was not an animal. He differed in some peculiar way&#10;from the other denizens of the jungle. Tarzan only knew that he&#10;hated him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At the pool Tarzan drank his fill and lay stretched upon the&#10;soft grass beneath the shade of a tree. His mind reverted to the&#10;battle with Histah, the snake. It seemed strange to him that Teeka&#10;should have placed herself within the folds of the horrid monster.&#10;Why had she done it? Why, indeed, had he? Teeka did not belong to&#10;him, nor did Teeka&#39;s balu. They were both Taug&#39;s. Why then had he&#10;done this thing? Histah was not food for him when he was dead.&#10;There seemed to Tarzan, now that he gave the matter thought, no&#10;reason in the world why he should have done the thing he did, and&#10;presently it occurred to him that he had acted almost&#10;involuntarily, just as he had acted when he had released the old&#10;Gomangani the previous evening.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;What made him do such things? Somebody more powerful than he&#10;must force him to act at times. &#34;All-powerful,&#34; thought Tarzan.&#10;&#34;The little bugs say that God is all-powerful. It must be that God&#10;made me do these things, for I never did them by myself. It was God&#10;who made Teeka rush upon Histah. Teeka would never go near Histah&#10;of her own volition. It was God who held my knife from the throat&#10;of the old Gomangani. God accomplishes strange things for he is&#10;&#39;all-powerful.&#39; I cannot see Him; but I know that it must be God&#10;who does these things. No Mangani, no Gomangani, no Tarmangani&#10;could do them.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And the flowers&#8212;who made them grow? Ah, now it was all&#10;explained&#8212;the flowers, the trees, the moon, the sun, himself, every&#10;living creature in the jungle&#8212;they were all made by God out of&#10;nothing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And what was God? What did God look like? Of that he had no&#10;conception; but he was sure that everything that was good came from&#10;God. His good act in refraining from slaying the poor, defenseless&#10;old Gomangani; Teeka&#39;s love that had hurled her into the embrace of&#10;death; his own loyalty to Teeka which had jeopardized his life that&#10;she might live. The flowers and the trees were good and beautiful.&#10;God had made them. He made the other creatures, too, that each&#10;might have food upon which to live. He had made Sheeta, the&#10;panther, with his beautiful coat; and Numa, the lion, with his&#10;noble head and his shaggy mane. He had made Bara, the deer, lovely&#10;and graceful.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Yes, Tarzan had found God, and he spent the whole day in&#10;attributing to Him all of the good and beautiful things of nature;&#10;but there was one thing which troubled him. He could not quite&#10;reconcile it to his conception of his new-found God.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Who made Histah, the snake?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 15, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/943')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;Tarzan and the Black Boy'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;TARZAN OF THE Apes sat at the foot of a great tree braiding a&#10;new grass rope. Beside him lay the frayed remnants of the old one,&#10;torn and severed by the fangs and talons of Sheeta, the panther.&#10;Only half the original rope was there, the balance having been&#10;carried off by the angry cat as he bounded away through the jungle&#10;with the noose still about his savage neck and the loose end&#10;dragging among the underbrush.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan smiled as he recalled Sheeta&#39;s great rage, his frantic&#10;efforts to free himself from the entangling strands, his uncanny&#10;screams that were part hate, part anger, part terror. He smiled in&#10;retrospection at the discomfiture of his enemy, and in anticipation&#10;of another day as he added an extra strand to his new rope.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;This would be the strongest, the heaviest rope that Tarzan of&#10;the Apes ever had fashioned. Visions of Numa, the lion, straining&#10;futilely in its embrace thrilled the ape-man. He was quite content,&#10;for his hands and his brain were busy. Content, too, were his&#10;fellows of the tribe of Kerchak, searching for food in the clearing&#10;and the surrounding trees about him. No perplexing thoughts of the&#10;future burdened their minds, and only occasionally, dimly arose&#10;recollections of the near past. They were stimulated to a species&#10;of brutal content by the delectable business of filling their&#10;bellies. Afterward they would sleep&#8212;it was their life, and they&#10;enjoyed it as we enjoy ours, you and I&#8212;as Tarzan enjoyed his.&#10;Possibly they enjoyed theirs more than we enjoy ours, for who shall&#10;say that the beasts of the jungle do not better fulfill the&#10;purposes for which they are created than does man with his many&#10;excursions into strange fields and his contraventions of the laws&#10;of nature? And what gives greater content and greater happiness&#10;than the fulfilling of a destiny?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As Tarzan worked, Gazan, Teeka&#39;s little balu, played about him&#10;while Teeka sought food upon the opposite side of the clearing. No&#10;more did Teeka, the mother, or Taug, the sullen sire, harbor&#10;suspicions of Tarzan&#39;s intentions toward their first-born. Had he&#10;not courted death to save their Gazan from the fangs and talons of&#10;Sheeta? Did he not fondle and cuddle the little one with even as&#10;great a show of affection as Teeka herself displayed? Their fears&#10;were allayed and Tarzan now found himself often in the role of&#10;nursemaid to a tiny anthropoid&#8212; an avocation which he found by no&#10;means irksome, since Gazan was a never-failing fount of surprises&#10;and entertainment.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Just now the apeling was developing those arboreal tendencies&#10;which were to stand him in such good stead during the years of his&#10;youth, when rapid flight into the upper terraces was of far more&#10;importance and value than his undeveloped muscles and untried&#10;fighting fangs. Backing off fifteen or twenty feet from the bole of&#10;the tree beneath the branches of which Tarzan worked upon his rope,&#10;Gazan scampered quickly forward, scrambling nimbly upward to the&#10;lower limbs. Here he would squat for a moment or two, quite proud&#10;of his achievement, then clamber to the ground again and repeat.&#10;Sometimes, quite often in fact, for he was an ape, his attention&#10;was distracted by other things, a beetle, a caterpillar, a tiny&#10;field mouse, and off he would go in pursuit; the caterpillars he&#10;always caught, and sometimes the beetles; but the field mice,&#10;never.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now he discovered the tail of the rope upon which Tarzan was&#10;working. Grasping it in one small hand he bounced away, for all the&#10;world like an animated rubber ball, snatching it from the ape-man&#39;s&#10;hand and running off across the clearing. Tarzan leaped to his feet&#10;and was in pursuit in an instant, no trace of anger on his face or&#10;in his voice as he called to the roguish little balu to drop his&#10;rope.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Straight toward his mother raced Gazan, and after him came&#10;Tarzan. Teeka looked up from her feeding, and in the first instant&#10;that she realized that Gazan was fleeing and that another was in&#10;pursuit, she bared her fangs and bristled; but when she saw that&#10;the pursuer was Tarzan she turned back to the business that had&#10;been occupying her attention. At her very feet the ape-man&#10;overhauled the balu and, though the youngster squealed and fought&#10;when Tarzan seized him, Teeka only glanced casually in their&#10;direction. No longer did she fear harm to her first-born at the&#10;hands of the ape-man. Had he not saved Gazan on two occasions?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Rescuing his rope, Tarzan returned to his tree and resumed his&#10;labor; but thereafter it was necessary to watch carefully the&#10;playful balu, who was now possessed to steal it whenever he thought&#10;his great, smooth-skinned cousin was momentarily off his guard.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But even under this handicap Tarzan finally completed the rope,&#10;a long, pliant weapon, stronger than any he ever had made before.&#10;The discarded piece of his former one he gave to Gazan for a&#10;plaything, for Tarzan had it in his mind to instruct Teeka&#39;s balu&#10;after ideas of his own when the youngster should be old and strong&#10;enough to profit by his precepts. At present the little ape&#39;s&#10;innate aptitude for mimicry would be sufficient to familiarize him&#10;with Tarzan&#39;s ways and weapons, and so the ape-man swung off into&#10;the jungle, his new rope coiled over one shoulder, while little&#10;Gazan hopped about the clearing dragging the old one after him in&#10;childish glee.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As Tarzan traveled, dividing his quest for food with one for a&#10;sufficiently noble quarry whereupon to test his new weapon, his&#10;mind often was upon Gazan. The ape-man had realized a deep&#10;affection for Teeka&#39;s balu almost from the first, partly because&#10;the child belonged to Teeka, his first love, and partly for the&#10;little ape&#39;s own sake, and Tarzan&#39;s human longing for some sentient&#10;creature upon which to expend those natural affections of the soul&#10;which are inherent to all normal members of the GENUS HOMO. Tarzan&#10;envied Teeka. It was true that Gazan evidenced a considerable&#10;reciprocation of Tarzan&#39;s fondness for him, even preferring him to&#10;his own surly sire; but to Teeka the little one turned when in pain&#10;or terror, when tired or hungry. Then it was that Tarzan felt quite&#10;alone in the world and longed desperately for one who should turn&#10;first to him for succor and protection.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Taug had Teeka; Teeka had Gazan; and nearly every other bull and&#10;cow of the tribe of Kerchak had one or more to love and by whom to&#10;be loved. Of course Tarzan could scarcely formulate the thought in&#10;precisely this way&#8212;he only knew that he craved something which was&#10;denied him; something which seemed to be represented by those&#10;relations which existed between Teeka and her balu, and so he&#10;envied Teeka and longed for a balu of his own.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He saw Sheeta and his mate with their little family of three;&#10;and deeper inland toward the rocky hills, where one might lie up&#10;during the heat of the day, in the dense shade of a tangled thicket&#10;close under the cool face of an overhanging rock, Tarzan had found&#10;the lair of Numa, the lion, and of Sabor, the lioness. Here he had&#10;watched them with their little balus&#8212;playful creatures, spotted&#10;leopard-like. And he had seen the young fawn with Bara, the deer,&#10;and with Buto, the rhinoceros, its ungainly little one. Each of the&#10;creatures of the jungle had its own&#8212;except Tarzan. It made the&#10;ape-man sad to think upon this thing, sad and lonely; but presently&#10;the scent of game cleared his young mind of all other&#10;considerations, as catlike he crawled far out upon a bending limb&#10;above the game trail which led down to the ancient watering place&#10;of the wild things of this wild world.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;How many thousands of times had this great, old limb bent to the&#10;savage form of some blood-thirsty hunter in the long years that it&#10;had spread its leafy branches above the deep-worn jungle path!&#10;Tarzan, the ape-man, Sheeta, the panther, and Histah, the snake, it&#10;knew well. They had worn smooth the bark upon its upper&#10;surface.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Today it was Horta, the boar, which came down toward the watcher&#10;in the old tree&#8212;Horta, the boar, whose formidable tusks and&#10;diabolical temper preserved him from all but the most ferocious or&#10;most famished of the largest carnivora.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But to Tarzan, meat was meat; naught that was edible or tasty&#10;might pass a hungry Tarzan unchallenged and unattacked. In hunger,&#10;as in battle, the ape-man out-savaged the dreariest denizens of the&#10;jungle. He knew neither fear nor mercy, except upon rare occasions&#10;when some strange, inexplicable force stayed his hand&#8212;a force&#10;inexplicable to him, perhaps, because of his ignorance of his own&#10;origin and of all the forces of humanitarianism and civilization&#10;that were his rightful heritage because of that origin.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So today, instead of staying his hand until a less formidable&#10;feast found its way toward him, Tarzan dropped his new noose about&#10;the neck of Horta, the boar. It was an excellent test for the&#10;untried strands. The angered boar bolted this way and that; but&#10;each time the new rope held him where Tarzan had made it fast about&#10;the stem of the tree above the branch from which he had cast&#10;it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As Horta grunted and charged, slashing the sturdy jungle&#10;patriarch with his mighty tusks until the bark flew in every&#10;direction, Tarzan dropped to the ground behind him. In the&#10;ape-man&#39;s hand was the long, keen blade that had been his constant&#10;companion since that distant day upon which chance had directed its&#10;point into the body of Bolgani, the gorilla, and saved the torn and&#10;bleeding man-child from what else had been certain death.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan walked in toward Horta, who swung now to face his enemy.&#10;Mighty and muscled as was the young giant, it yet would have&#10;appeared but the maddest folly for him to face so formidable a&#10;creature as Horta, the boar, armed only with a slender hunting&#10;knife. So it would have seemed to one who knew Horta even slightly&#10;and Tarzan not at all.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For a moment Horta stood motionless facing the ape-man. His&#10;wicked, deep-set eyes flashed angrily. He shook his lowered&#10;head.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Mud-eater!&#34; jeered the ape-man. &#34;Wallower in filth. Even your&#10;meat stinks, but it is juicy and makes Tarzan strong. Today I shall&#10;eat your heart, O Lord of the Great Tusks, that it shall keep&#10;savage that which pounds against my own ribs.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Horta, understanding nothing of what Tarzan said, was none the&#10;less enraged because of that. He saw only a naked man-thing,&#10;hairless and futile, pitting his puny fangs and soft muscles&#10;against his own indomitable savagery, and he charged.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan of the Apes waited until the upcut of a wicked tusk would&#10;have laid open his thigh, then he moved&#8212;just the least bit to one&#10;side; but so quickly that lightning was a sluggard by comparison,&#10;and as he moved, he stooped low and with all the great power of his&#10;right arm drove the long blade of his father&#39;s hunting knife&#10;straight into the heart of Horta, the boar. A quick leap carried&#10;him from the zone of the creature&#39;s death throes, and a moment&#10;later the hot and dripping heart of Horta was in his grasp.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;His hunger satisfied, Tarzan did not seek a lying-up place for&#10;sleep, as was sometimes his way, but continued on through the&#10;jungle more in search of adventure than of food, for today he was&#10;restless. And so it came that he turned his footsteps toward the&#10;village of Mbonga, the black chief, whose people Tarzan had baited&#10;remorselessly since that day upon which Kulonga, the chief&#39;s son,&#10;had slain Kala.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A river winds close beside the village of the black men. Tarzan&#10;reached its side a little below the clearing where squat the&#10;thatched huts of the Negroes. The river life was ever fascinating&#10;to the ape-man. He found pleasure in watching the ungainly antics&#10;of Duro, the hippopotamus, and keen sport in tormenting the&#10;sluggish crocodile, Gimla, as he basked in the sun. Then, too,&#10;there were the shes and the balus of the black men of the Gomangani&#10;to frighten as they squatted by the river, the shes with their&#10;meager washing, the balus with their primitive toys.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;This day he came upon a woman and her child farther down stream&#10;than usual. The former was searching for a species of shellfish&#10;which was to be found in the mud close to the river bank. She was a&#10;young black woman of about thirty. Her teeth were filed to sharp&#10;points, for her people ate the flesh of man. Her under lip was slit&#10;that it might support a rude pendant of copper which she had worn&#10;for so many years that the lip had been dragged downward to&#10;prodigious lengths, exposing the teeth and gums of her lower jaw.&#10;Her nose, too, was slit, and through the slit was a wooden skewer.&#10;Metal ornaments dangled from her ears, and upon her forehead and&#10;cheeks; upon her chin and the bridge of her nose were tattooings in&#10;colors that were mellowed now by age. She was naked except for a&#10;girdle of grasses about her waist. Altogether she was very&#10;beautiful in her own estimation and even in the estimation of the&#10;men of Mbonga&#39;s tribe, though she was of another people&#8212;a trophy of&#10;war seized in her maidenhood by one of Mbonga&#39;s fighting men.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Her child was a boy of ten, lithe, straight and, for a black,&#10;handsome. Tarzan looked upon the two from the concealing foliage of&#10;a near-by bush. He was about to leap forth before them with a&#10;terrifying scream, that he might enjoy the spectacle of their&#10;terror and their incontinent flight; but of a sudden a new whim&#10;seized him. Here was a balu fashioned as he himself was fashioned.&#10;Of course this one&#39;s skin was black; but what of it? Tarzan had&#10;never seen a white man. In so far as he knew, he was the sole&#10;representative of that strange form of life upon the earth. The&#10;black boy should make an excellent balu for Tarzan, since he had&#10;none of his own. He would tend him carefully, feed him well,&#10;protect him as only Tarzan of the Apes could protect his own, and&#10;teach him out of his half human, half bestial lore the secrets of&#10;the jungle from its rotting surface vegetation to the high tossed&#10;pinnacles of the forest&#39;s upper terraces.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan uncoiled his rope, and shook out the noose. The two&#10;before him, all ignorant of the near presence of that terrifying&#10;form, continued preoccupied in the search for shellfish, poking&#10;about in the mud with short sticks.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan stepped from the jungle behind them; his noose lay open&#10;upon the ground beside him. There was a quick movement of the right&#10;arm and the noose rose gracefully into the air, hovered an instant&#10;above the head of the unsuspecting youth, then settled. As it&#10;encompassed his body below the shoulders, Tarzan gave a quick jerk&#10;that tightened it about the boy&#39;s arms, pinioning them to his&#10;sides. A scream of terror broke from the lad&#39;s lips, and as his&#10;mother turned, affrighted at his cry, she saw him being dragged&#10;quickly toward a great white giant who stood just beneath the shade&#10;of a near-by tree, scarcely a dozen long paces from her.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With a savage cry of terror and rage, the woman leaped&#10;fearlessly toward the ape-man. In her mien Tarzan saw determination&#10;and courage which would shrink not even from death itself. She was&#10;very hideous and frightful even when her face was in repose; but&#10;convulsed by passion, her expression became terrifyingly fiendish.&#10;Even the ape-man drew back, but more in revulsion than fear&#8212;fear he&#10;knew not.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Biting and kicking was the black she&#39;s balu as Tarzan tucked him&#10;beneath his arm and vanished into the branches hanging low above&#10;him, just as the infuriated mother dashed forward to seize and do&#10;battle with him. And as he melted away into the depth of the jungle&#10;with his still struggling prize, he meditated upon the&#10;possibilities which might lie in the prowess of the Gomangani were&#10;the hes as formidable as the shes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Once at a safe distance from the despoiled mother and out of&#10;earshot of her screams and menaces, Tarzan paused to inspect his&#10;prize, now so thoroughly terrorized that he had ceased his&#10;struggles and his outcries.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The frightened child rolled his eyes fearfully toward his&#10;captor, until the whites showed gleaming all about the irises.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I am Tarzan,&#34; said the ape-man, in the vernacular of the&#10;anthropoids. &#34;I will not harm you. You are to be Tarzan&#39;s balu.&#10;Tarzan will protect you. He will feed you. The best in the jungle&#10;shall be for Tarzan&#39;s balu, for Tarzan is a mighty hunter. None&#10;need you fear, not even Numa, the lion, for Tarzan is a mighty&#10;fighter. None so great as Tarzan, son of Kala. Do not fear.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But the child only whimpered and trembled, for he did not&#10;understand the tongue of the great apes, and the voice of Tarzan&#10;sounded to him like the barking and growling of a beast. Then, too,&#10;he had heard stories of this bad, white forest god. It was he who&#10;had slain Kulonga and others of the warriors of Mbonga, the chief.&#10;It was he who entered the village stealthily, by magic, in the&#10;darkness of the night, to steal arrows and poison, and frighten the&#10;women and the children and even the great warriors. Doubtless this&#10;wicked god fed upon little boys. Had his mother not said as much&#10;when he was naughty and she threatened to give him to the white god&#10;of the jungle if he were not good? Little black Tibo shook as with&#10;ague.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Are you cold, Go-bu-balu?&#34; asked Tarzan, using the simian&#10;equivalent of black he-baby in lieu of a better name. &#34;The sun is&#10;hot; why do you shiver?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tibo could not understand; but he cried for his mamma and begged&#10;the great, white god to let him go, promising always to be a good&#10;boy thereafter if his plea were granted. Tarzan shook his head. Not&#10;a word could he understand. This would never do! He must teach&#10;Go-bu-balu a language which sounded like talk. It was quite certain&#10;to Tarzan that Go-bu-balu&#39;s speech was not talk at all. It sounded&#10;quite as senseless as the chattering of the silly birds. It would&#10;be best, thought the ape-man, quickly to get him among the tribe of&#10;Kerchak where he would hear the Mangani talking among themselves.&#10;Thus he would soon learn an intelligible form of speech.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan rose to his feet upon the swaying branch where he had&#10;halted far above the ground, and motioned to the child to follow&#10;him; but Tibo only clung tightly to the bole of the tree and wept.&#10;Being a boy, and a native African, he had, of course, climbed into&#10;trees many times before this; but the idea of racing off through&#10;the forest, leaping from one branch to another, as his captor, to&#10;his horror, had done when he had carried Tibo away from his mother,&#10;filled his childish heart with terror.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan sighed. His newly acquired balu had much indeed to learn.&#10;It was pitiful that a balu of his size and strength should be so&#10;backward. He tried to coax Tibo to follow him; but the child dared&#10;not, so Tarzan picked him up and carried him upon his back. Tibo no&#10;longer scratched or bit. Escape seemed impossible. Even now, were&#10;he set upon the ground, the chance was remote, he knew, that he&#10;could find his way back to the village of Mbonga, the chief. Even&#10;if he could, there were the lions and the leopards and the hyenas,&#10;any one of which, as Tibo was well aware, was particularly fond of&#10;the meat of little black boys.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So far the terrible white god of the jungle had offered him no&#10;harm. He could not expect even this much consideration from the&#10;frightful, green-eyed man-eaters. It would be the lesser of two&#10;evils, then, to let the white god carry him away without scratching&#10;and biting, as he had done at first.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As Tarzan swung rapidly through the trees, little Tibo closed&#10;his eyes in terror rather than look longer down into the frightful&#10;abysses beneath. Never before in all his life had Tibo been so&#10;frightened, yet as the white giant sped on with him through the&#10;forest there stole over the child an inexplicable sensation of&#10;security as he saw how true were the leaps of the ape-man, how&#10;unerring his grasp upon the swaying limbs which gave him hand-hold,&#10;and then, too, there was safety in the middle terraces of the&#10;forest, far above the reach of the dreaded lions.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And so Tarzan came to the clearing where the tribe fed, dropping&#10;among them with his new balu clinging tightly to his shoulders. He&#10;was fairly in the midst of them before Tibo spied a single one of&#10;the great hairy forms, or before the apes realized that Tarzan was&#10;not alone. When they saw the little Gomangani perched upon his back&#10;some of them came forward in curiosity with upcurled lips and&#10;snarling mien.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;An hour before little Tibo would have said that he knew the&#10;uttermost depths of fear; but now, as he saw these fearsome beasts&#10;surrounding him, he realized that all that had gone before was as&#10;nothing by comparison. Why did the great white giant stand there so&#10;unconcernedly? Why did he not flee before these horrid, hairy, tree&#10;men fell upon them both and tore them to pieces? And then there&#10;came to Tibo a numbing recollection. It was none other than the&#10;story he had heard passed from mouth to mouth, fearfully, by the&#10;people of Mbonga, the chief, that this great white demon of the&#10;jungle was naught other than a hairless ape, for had not he been&#10;seen in company with these?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tibo could only stare in wide-eyed horror at the approaching&#10;apes. He saw their beetling brows, their great fangs, their wicked&#10;eyes. He noted their mighty muscles rolling beneath their shaggy&#10;hides. Their every attitude and expression was a menace. Tarzan saw&#10;this, too. He drew Tibo around in front of him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;This is Tarzan&#39;s Go-bu-balu,&#34; he said. &#34;Do not harm him, or&#10;Tarzan will kill you,&#34; and he bared his own fangs in the teeth of&#10;the nearest ape.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It is a Gomangani,&#34; replied the ape. &#34;Let me kill it. It is a&#10;Gomangani. The Gomangani are our enemies. Let me kill it.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Go away,&#34; snarled Tarzan. &#34;I tell you, Gunto, it is Tarzan&#39;s&#10;balu. Go away or Tarzan will kill you,&#34; and the ape-man took a step&#10;toward the advancing ape.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The latter sidled off, quite stiff and haughty, after the manner&#10;of a dog which meets another and is too proud to fight and too&#10;fearful to turn his back and run.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Next came Teeka, prompted by curiosity. At her side skipped&#10;little Gazan. They were filled with wonder like the others; but&#10;Teeka did not bare her fangs. Tarzan saw this and motioned that she&#10;approach.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Tarzan has a balu now,&#34; he said. &#34;He and Teeka&#39;s balu can play&#10;together.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It is a Gomangani, &#34; replied Teeka. &#34;It will kill my balu. Take&#10;it away, Tarzan.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan laughed. &#34;It could not harm Pamba, the rat,&#34; he said. &#34;It&#10;is but a little balu and very frightened. Let Gazan play with&#10;it.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Teeka still was fearful, for with all their mighty ferocity the&#10;great anthropoids are timid; but at last, assured by her great&#10;confidence in Tarzan, she pushed Gazan forward toward the little&#10;black boy. The small ape, guided by instinct, drew back toward its&#10;mother, baring its small fangs and screaming in mingled fear and&#10;rage.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tibo, too, showed no signs of desiring a closer acquaintance&#10;with Gazan, so Tarzan gave up his efforts for the time.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;During the week which followed, Tarzan found his time much&#10;occupied. His balu was a greater responsibility than he had counted&#10;upon. Not for a moment did he dare leave it, since of all the&#10;tribe, Teeka alone could have been depended upon to refrain from&#10;slaying the hapless black had it not been for Tarzan&#39;s constant&#10;watchfulness. When the ape-man hunted, he must carry Go-bu-balu&#10;about with him. It was irksome, and then the little black seemed so&#10;stupid and fearful to Tarzan. It was quite helpless against even&#10;the lesser of the jungle creatures. Tarzan wondered how it had&#10;survived at all. He tried to teach it, and found a ray of hope in&#10;the fact that Go-bu-balu had mastered a few words of the language&#10;of the anthropoids, and that he could now cling to a high-tossed&#10;branch without screaming in fear; but there was something about the&#10;child which worried Tarzan. He often had watched the blacks within&#10;their village. He had seen the children playing, and always there&#10;had been much laughter; but little Go-bu-balu never laughed. It was&#10;true that Tarzan himself never laughed. Upon occasion he smiled,&#10;grimly, but to laughter he was a stranger. The black, however,&#10;should have laughed, reasoned the ape-man. It was the way of the&#10;Gomangani.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Also, he saw that the little fellow often refused food and was&#10;growing thinner day by day. At times he surprised the boy sobbing&#10;softly to himself. Tarzan tried to comfort him, even as fierce Kala&#10;had comforted Tarzan when the ape-man was a balu, but all to no&#10;avail. Go-bu-balu merely no longer feared Tarzan&#8212;that was all. He&#10;feared every other living thing within the jungle. He feared the&#10;jungle days with their long excursions through the dizzy tree tops.&#10;He feared the jungle nights with their swaying, perilous couches&#10;far above the ground, and the grunting and coughing of the great&#10;carnivora prowling beneath him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan did not know what to do. His heritage of English blood&#10;rendered it a difficult thing even to consider a surrender of his&#10;project, though he was forced to admit to himself that his balu was&#10;not all that he had hoped. Though he was faithful to his&#10;self-imposed task, and even found that he had grown to like&#10;Go-bu-balu, he could not deceive himself into believing that he&#10;felt for it that fierce heat of passionate affection which Teeka&#10;revealed for Gazan, and which the black mother had shown for&#10;Go-bu-balu.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The little black boy from cringing terror at the sight of Tarzan&#10;passed by degrees into trustfulness and admiration. Only kindness&#10;had he ever received at the hands of the great white devil-god, yet&#10;he had seen with what ferocity his kindly captor could deal with&#10;others. He had seen him leap upon a certain he-ape which persisted&#10;in attempting to seize and slay Go-bu-balu. He had seen the strong,&#10;white teeth of the ape-man fastened in the neck of his adversary,&#10;and the mighty muscles tensed in battle. He had heard the savage,&#10;bestial snarls and roars of combat, and he had realized with a&#10;shudder that he could not differentiate between those of his&#10;guardian and those of the hairy ape.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He had seen Tarzan bring down a buck, just as Numa, the lion,&#10;might have done, leaping upon its back and fastening his fangs in&#10;the creature&#39;s neck. Tibo had shuddered at the sight, but he had&#10;thrilled, too, and for the first time there entered his dull,&#10;Negroid mind a vague desire to emulate his savage foster parent.&#10;But Tibo, the little black boy, lacked the divine spark which had&#10;permitted Tarzan, the white boy, to benefit by his training in the&#10;ways of the fierce jungle. In imagination he was wanting, and&#10;imagination is but another name for super-intelligence.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Imagination it is which builds bridges, and cities, and empires.&#10;The beasts know it not, the blacks only a little, while to one in a&#10;hundred thousand of earth&#39;s dominant race it is given as a gift&#10;from heaven that man may not perish from the earth.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;While Tarzan pondered his problem concerning the future of his&#10;balu, Fate was arranging to take the matter out of his hands.&#10;Momaya, Tibo&#39;s mother, grief-stricken at the loss of her boy, had&#10;consulted the tribal witch-doctor, but to no avail. The medicine he&#10;made was not good medicine, for though Momaya paid him two goats&#10;for it, it did not bring back Tibo, nor even indicate where she&#10;might search for him with reasonable assurance of finding him.&#10;Momaya, being of a short temper and of another people, had little&#10;respect for the witch-doctor of her husband&#39;s tribe, and so, when&#10;he suggested that a further payment of two more fat goats would&#10;doubtless enable him to make stronger medicine, she promptly loosed&#10;her shrewish tongue upon him, and with such good effect that he was&#10;glad to take himself off with his zebra&#39;s tail and his pot of&#10;magic.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When he had gone and Momaya had succeeded in partially subduing&#10;her anger, she gave herself over to thought, as she so often had&#10;done since the abduction of her Tibo, in the hope that she finally&#10;might discover some feasible means of locating him, or at least&#10;assuring herself as to whether he were alive or dead.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was known to the blacks that Tarzan did not eat the flesh of&#10;man, for he had slain more than one of their number, yet never&#10;tasted the flesh of any. Too, the bodies always had been found,&#10;sometimes dropping as though from the clouds to alight in the&#10;center of the village. As Tibo&#39;s body had not been found, Momaya&#10;argued that he still lived, but where?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then it was that there came to her mind a recollection of&#10;Bukawai, the unclean, who dwelt in a cave in the hillside to the&#10;north, and who it was well known entertained devils in his evil&#10;lair. Few, if any, had the temerity to visit old Bukawai, firstly&#10;because of fear of his black magic and the two hyenas who dwelt&#10;with him and were commonly known to be devils masquerading, and&#10;secondly because of the loathsome disease which had caused Bukawai&#10;to be an outcast&#8212;a disease which was slowly eating away his&#10;face.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now it was that Momaya reasoned shrewdly that if any might know&#10;the whereabouts of her Tibo, it would be Bukawai, who was in&#10;friendly intercourse with gods and demons, since a demon or a god&#10;it was who had stolen her baby; but even her great mother love was&#10;sorely taxed to find the courage to send her forth into the black&#10;jungle toward the distant hills and the uncanny abode of Bukawai,&#10;the unclean, and his devils.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mother love, however, is one of the human passions which closely&#10;approximates to the dignity of an irresistible force. It drives the&#10;frail flesh of weak women to deeds of heroic measure. Momaya was&#10;neither frail nor weak, physically, but she was a woman, an&#10;ignorant, superstitious, African savage. She believed in devils, in&#10;black magic, and in witchcraft. To Momaya, the jungle was inhabited&#10;by far more terrifying things than lions and leopards&#8212;horrifying,&#10;nameless things which possessed the power of wreaking frightful&#10;harm under various innocent guises.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;From one of the warriors of the village, whom she knew to have&#10;once stumbled upon the lair of Bukawai, the mother of Tibo learned&#10;how she might find it&#8212;near a spring of water which rose in a small&#10;rocky canon between two hills, the easternmost of which was easily&#10;recognizable because of a huge granite boulder which rested upon&#10;its summit. The westerly hill was lower than its companion, and was&#10;quite bare of vegetation except for a single mimosa tree which grew&#10;just a little below its summit.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;These two hills, the man assured her, could be seen for some&#10;distance before she reached them, and together formed an excellent&#10;guide to her destination. He warned her, however, to abandon so&#10;foolish and dangerous an adventure, emphasizing what she already&#10;quite well knew, that if she escaped harm at the hands of Bukawai&#10;and his demons, the chances were that she would not be so fortunate&#10;with the great carnivora of the jungle through which she must pass&#10;going and returning.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The warrior even went to Momaya&#39;s husband, who, in turn, having&#10;little authority over the vixenish lady of his choice, went to&#10;Mbonga, the chief. The latter summoned Momaya, threatening her with&#10;the direst punishment should she venture forth upon so unholy an&#10;excursion. The old chief&#39;s interest in the matter was due solely to&#10;that age-old alliance which exists between church and state. The&#10;local witch-doctor, knowing his own medicine better than any other&#10;knew it, was jealous of all other pretenders to accomplishments in&#10;the black art. He long had heard of the power of Bukawai, and&#10;feared lest, should he succeed in recovering Momaya&#39;s lost child,&#10;much of the tribal patronage and consequent fees would be diverted&#10;to the unclean one. As Mbonga received, as chief, a certain&#10;proportion of the witch-doctor&#39;s fees and could expect nothing from&#10;Bukawai, his heart and soul were, quite naturally, wrapped up in&#10;the orthodox church.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But if Momaya could view with intrepid heart an excursion into&#10;the jungle and a visit to the fear-haunted abode of Bukawai, she&#10;was not likely to be deterred by threats of future punishment at&#10;the hands of old Mbonga, whom she secretly despised. Yet she&#10;appeared to accede to his injunctions, returning to her hut in&#10;silence.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She would have preferred starting upon her quest by day-light,&#10;but this was now out of the question, since she must carry food and&#10;a weapon of some sort&#8212;things which she never could pass out of the&#10;village with by day without being subjected to curious questioning&#10;that surely would come immediately to the ears of Mbonga.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So Momaya bided her time until night, and just before the gates&#10;of the village were closed, she slipped through into the darkness&#10;and the jungle. She was much frightened, but she set her face&#10;resolutely toward the north, and though she paused often to listen,&#10;breathlessly, for the huge cats which, here, were her greatest&#10;terror, she nevertheless continued her way staunchly for several&#10;hours, until a low moan a little to her right and behind her&#10;brought her to a sudden stop.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With palpitating heart the woman stood, scarce daring to&#10;breathe, and then, very faintly but unmistakable to her keen ears,&#10;came the stealthy crunching of twigs and grasses beneath padded&#10;feet.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;All about Momaya grew the giant trees of the tropical jungle,&#10;festooned with hanging vines and mosses. She seized upon the&#10;nearest and started to clamber, apelike, to the branches above. As&#10;she did so, there was a sudden rush of a great body behind her, a&#10;menacing roar that caused the earth to tremble, and something&#10;crashed into the very creepers to which she was clinging&#8212;but below&#10;her.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Momaya drew herself to safety among the leafy branches and&#10;thanked the foresight which had prompted her to bring along the&#10;dried human ear which hung from a cord about her neck. She always&#10;had known that that ear was good medicine. It had been given her,&#10;when a girl, by the witch-doctor of her town tribe, and was nothing&#10;like the poor, weak medicine of Mbonga&#39;s witch-doctor.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;All night Momaya clung to her perch, for although the lion&#10;sought other prey after a short time, she dared not descend into&#10;the darkness again, for fear she might encounter him or another of&#10;his kind; but at daylight she clambered down and resumed her&#10;way.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan of the Apes, finding that his balu never ceased to give&#10;evidence of terror in the presence of the apes of the tribe, and&#10;also that most of the adult apes were a constant menace to&#10;Go-bu-balu&#39;s life, so that Tarzan dared not leave him alone with&#10;them, took to hunting with the little black boy farther and farther&#10;from the stamping grounds of the anthropoids.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Little by little his absences from the tribe grew in length as&#10;he wandered farther away from them, until finally he found himself&#10;a greater distance to the north than he ever before had hunted, and&#10;with water and ample game and fruit, he felt not at all inclined to&#10;return to the tribe.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Little Go-bu-balu gave evidences of a greater interest in life,&#10;an interest which varied in direct proportion to the distance he&#10;was from the apes of Kerchak. He now trotted along behind Tarzan&#10;when the ape-man went upon the ground, and in the trees he even did&#10;his best to follow his mighty foster parent. The boy was still sad&#10;and lonely. His thin, little body had grown steadily thinner since&#10;he had come among the apes, for while, as a young cannibal, he was&#10;not overnice in the matter of diet, he found it not always to his&#10;taste to stomach the weird things which tickled the palates of&#10;epicures among the apes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;His large eyes were very large indeed now, his cheeks sunken,&#10;and every rib of his emaciated body plainly discernible to&#10;whomsoever should care to count them. Constant terror, perhaps, had&#10;had as much to do with his physical condition as had improper food.&#10;Tarzan noticed the change and was worried. He had hoped to see his&#10;balu wax sturdy and strong. His disappointment was great. In only&#10;one respect did Go-bu-balu seem to progress&#8212;he readily was&#10;mastering the language of the apes. Even now he and Tarzan could&#10;converse in a fairly satisfactory manner by supplementing the&#10;meager ape speech with signs; but for the most part, Go-bu-balu was&#10;silent other than to answer questions put to him. His great sorrow&#10;was yet too new and too poignant to be laid aside even momentarily.&#10;Always he pined for Momaya&#8212;shrewish, hideous, repulsive, perhaps,&#10;she would have been to you or me, but to Tibo she was mamma, the&#10;personification of that one great love which knows no selfishness&#10;and which does not consume itself in its own fires.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As the two hunted, or rather as Tarzan hunted and Go-bu-balu&#10;tagged along in his wake, the ape-man noticed many things and&#10;thought much. Once they came upon Sabor moaning in the tall&#10;grasses. About her romped and played two little balls of fur, but&#10;her eyes were for one which lay between her great forepaws and did&#10;not romp, one who never would romp again.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan read aright the anguish and the suffering of the huge&#10;mother cat. He had been minded to bait her. It was to do this that&#10;he had sneaked silently through the trees until he had come almost&#10;above her, but something held the ape-man as he saw the lioness&#10;grieving over her dead cub. With the acquisition of Go-bu-balu,&#10;Tarzan had come to realize the responsibilities and sorrows of&#10;parentage, without its joys. His heart went out to Sabor as it&#10;might not have done a few weeks before. As he watched her, there&#10;rose quite unbidden before him a vision of Momaya, the skewer&#10;through the septum of her nose, her pendulous under lip sagging&#10;beneath the weight which dragged it down. Tarzan saw not her&#10;unloveliness; he saw only the same anguish that was Sabor&#39;s, and he&#10;winced. That strange functioning of the mind which sometimes is&#10;called association of ideas snapped Teeka and Gazan before the&#10;ape-man&#39;s mental vision. What if one should come and take Gazan&#10;from Teeka. Tarzan uttered a low and ominous growl as though Gazan&#10;were his own. Go-bu-balu glanced here and there apprehensively,&#10;thinking that Tarzan had espied an enemy. Sabor sprang suddenly to&#10;her feet, her yellow-green eyes blazing, her tail lashing as she&#10;cocked her ears, and raising her muzzle, sniffed the air for&#10;possible danger. The two little cubs, which had been playing,&#10;scampered quickly to her, and standing beneath her, peered out from&#10;between her forelegs, their big ears upstanding, their little heads&#10;cocked first upon one side and then upon the other.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With a shake of his black shock, Tarzan turned away and resumed&#10;his hunting in another direction; but all day there rose one after&#10;another, above the threshold of his objective mind, memory&#10;portraits of Sabor, of Momaya, and of Teeka&#8212;a lioness, a cannibal,&#10;and a she-ape, yet to the ape-man they were identical through&#10;motherhood.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was noon of the third day when Momaya came within sight of&#10;the cave of Bukawai, the unclean. The old witch-doctor had rigged a&#10;framework of interlaced boughs to close the mouth of the cave from&#10;predatory beasts. This was now set to one side, and the black&#10;cavern beyond yawned mysterious and repellent. Momaya shivered as&#10;from a cold wind of the rainy season. No sign of life appeared&#10;about the cave, yet Momaya experienced that uncanny sensation as of&#10;unseen eyes regarding her malevolently. Again she shuddered. She&#10;tried to force her unwilling feet onward toward the cave, when from&#10;its depths issued an uncanny sound that was neither brute nor&#10;human, a weird sound that was akin to mirthless laughter.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With a stifled scream, Momaya turned and fled into the jungle.&#10;For a hundred yards she ran before she could control her terror,&#10;and then she paused, listening. Was all her labor, were all the&#10;terrors and dangers through which she had passed to go for naught?&#10;She tried to steel herself to return to the cave, but again fright&#10;overcame her.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Saddened, disheartened, she turned slowly upon the back trail&#10;toward the village of Mbonga. Her young shoulders now were drooped&#10;like those of an old woman who bears a great burden of many years&#10;with their accumulated pains and sorrows, and she walked with tired&#10;feet and a halting step. The spring of youth was gone from&#10;Momaya.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For another hundred yards she dragged her weary way, her brain&#10;half paralyzed from dumb terror and suffering, and then there came&#10;to her the memory of a little babe that suckled at her breast, and&#10;of a slim boy who romped, laughing, about her, and they were both&#10;Tibo&#8212;her Tibo!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Her shoulders straightened. She shook her savage head, and she&#10;turned about and walked boldly back to the mouth of the cave of&#10;Bukawai, the unclean&#8212;of Bukawai, the witch-doctor.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Again, from the interior of the cave came the hideous laughter&#10;that was not laughter. This time Momaya recognized it for what it&#10;was, the strange cry of a hyena. No more did she shudder, but she&#10;held her spear ready and called aloud to Bukawai to come out.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Instead of Bukawai came the repulsive head of a hyena. Momaya&#10;poked at it with her spear, and the ugly, sullen brute drew back&#10;with an angry growl. Again Momaya called Bukawai by name, and this&#10;time there came an answer in mumbling tones that were scarce more&#10;human than those of the beast.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Who comes to Bukawai?&#34; queried the voice.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It is Momaya,&#34; replied the woman; &#34;Momaya from the village of&#10;Mbonga, the chief.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What do you want?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I want good medicine, better medicine than Mbonga&#39;s&#10;witch-doctor can make,&#34; replied Momaya. &#34;The great, white, jungle&#10;god has stolen my Tibo, and I want medicine to bring him back, or&#10;to find where he is hidden that I may go and get him.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Who is Tibo?&#34; asked Bukawai.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Momaya told him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Bukawai&#39;s medicine is very strong,&#34; said the voice. &#34;Five goats&#10;and a new sleeping mat are scarce enough in exchange for Bukawai&#39;s&#10;medicine.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Two goats are enough,&#34; said Momaya, for the spirit of barter is&#10;strong in the breasts of the blacks.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The pleasure of haggling over the price was a sufficiently&#10;potent lure to draw Bukawai to the mouth of the cave. Momaya was&#10;sorry when she saw him that he had not remained within. There are&#10;some things too horrible, too hideous, too repulsive for&#10;description&#8212;Bukawai&#39;s face was of these. When Momaya saw him she&#10;understood why it was that he was almost inarticulate.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Beside him were two hyenas, which rumor had said were his only&#10;and constant companions. They made an excellent trio&#8212;the most&#10;repulsive of beasts with the most repulsive of humans.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Five goats and a new sleeping mat,&#34; mumbled Bukawai.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Two fat goats and a sleeping mat.&#34; Momaya raised her bid; but&#10;Bukawai was obdurate. He stuck for the five goats and the sleeping&#10;mat for a matter of half an hour, while the hyenas sniffed and&#10;growled and laughed hideously. Momaya was determined to give all&#10;that Bukawai asked if she could do no better, but haggling is&#10;second nature to black barterers, and in the end it partly repaid&#10;her, for a compromise finally was reached which included three fat&#10;goats, a new sleeping mat, and a piece of copper wire.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Come back tonight,&#34; said Bukawai, &#34;when the moon is two hours&#10;in the sky. Then will I make the strong medicine which shall bring&#10;Tibo back to you. Bring with you the three fat goats, the new&#10;sleeping mat, and the piece of copper wire the length of a large&#10;man&#39;s forearm.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I cannot bring them,&#34; said Momaya. &#34;You will have to come after&#10;them. When you have restored Tibo to me, you shall have them all at&#10;the village of Mbonga.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Bukawai shook his head.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I will make no medicine,&#34; he said, &#34;until I have the goats and&#10;the mat and the copper wire.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Momaya pleaded and threatened, but all to no avail. Finally, she&#10;turned away and started off through the jungle toward the village&#10;of Mbonga. How she could get three goats and a sleeping mat out of&#10;the village and through the jungle to the cave of Bukawai, she did&#10;not know, but that she would do it somehow she was quite&#10;positive&#8212;she would do it or die. Tibo must be restored to her.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan coming lazily through the jungle with little Go-bu-balu,&#10;caught the scent of Bara, the deer. Tarzan hungered for the flesh&#10;of Bara. Naught tickled his palate so greatly; but to stalk Bara&#10;with Go-bu-balu at his heels, was out of the question, so he hid&#10;the child in the crotch of a tree where the thick foliage screened&#10;him from view, and set off swiftly and silently upon the spoor of&#10;Bara.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tibo alone was more terrified than Tibo even among the apes.&#10;Real and apparent dangers are less disconcerting than those which&#10;we imagine, and only the gods of his people knew how much Tibo&#10;imagined.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He had been but a short time in his hiding place when he heard&#10;something approaching through the jungle. He crouched closer to the&#10;limb upon which he lay and prayed that Tarzan would return quickly.&#10;His wide eyes searched the jungle in the direction of the moving&#10;creature.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;What if it was a leopard that had caught his scent! It would be&#10;upon him in a minute. Hot tears flowed from the large eyes of&#10;little Tibo. The curtain of jungle foliage rustled close at hand.&#10;The thing was but a few paces from his tree! His eyes fairly popped&#10;from his black face as he watched for the appearance of the dread&#10;creature which presently would thrust a snarling countenance from&#10;between the vines and creepers.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And then the curtain parted and a woman stepped into full view.&#10;With a gasping cry, Tibo tumbled from his perch and raced toward&#10;her. Momaya suddenly started back and raised her spear, but a&#10;second later she cast it aside and caught the thin body in her&#10;strong arms.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Crushing it to her, she cried and laughed all at one and the&#10;same time, and hot tears of joy, mingled with the tears of Tibo,&#10;trickled down the crease between her naked breasts.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Disturbed by the noise so close at hand, there arose from his&#10;sleep in a near-by thicket Numa, the lion. He looked through the&#10;tangled underbrush and saw the black woman and her young. He licked&#10;his chops and measured the distance between them and himself. A&#10;short charge and a long leap would carry him upon them. He flicked&#10;the end of his tail and sighed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A vagrant breeze, swirling suddenly in the wrong direction,&#10;carried the scent of Tarzan to the sensitive nostrils of Bara, the&#10;deer. There was a startled tensing of muscles and cocking of ears,&#10;a sudden dash, and Tarzan&#39;s meat was gone. The ape-man angrily&#10;shook his head and turned back toward the spot where he had left&#10;Go-bu-balu. He came softly, as was his way. Before he reached the&#10;spot he heard strange sounds&#8212;the sound of a woman laughing and of a&#10;woman weeping, and the two which seemed to come from one throat&#10;were mingled with the convulsive sobbing of a child. Tarzan&#10;hastened, and when Tarzan hastened, only the birds and the wind&#10;went faster.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And as Tarzan approached the sounds, he heard another, a deep&#10;sigh. Momaya did not hear it, nor did Tibo; but the ears of Tarzan&#10;were as the ears of Bara, the deer. He heard the sigh, and he knew,&#10;so he unloosed the heavy spear which dangled at his back. Even as&#10;he sped through the branches of the trees, with the same ease that&#10;you or I might take out a pocket handkerchief as we strolled&#10;nonchalantly down a lazy country lane, Tarzan of the Apes took the&#10;spear from its thong that it might be ready against any&#10;emergency.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Numa, the lion, did not rush madly to attack. He reasoned again,&#10;and reason told him that already the prey was his, so he pushed his&#10;great bulk through the foliage and stood eyeing his meat with&#10;baleful, glaring eyes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Momaya saw him and shrieked, drawing Tibo closer to her breast.&#10;To have found her child and to lose him, all in a moment! She&#10;raised her spear, throwing her hand far back of her shoulder. Numa&#10;roared and stepped slowly forward. Momaya cast her weapon. It&#10;grazed the tawny shoulder, inflicting a flesh wound which aroused&#10;all the terrific bestiality of the carnivore, and the lion&#10;charged.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Momaya tried to close her eyes, but could not. She saw the&#10;flashing swiftness of the huge, oncoming death, and then she saw&#10;something else. She saw a mighty, naked white man drop as from the&#10;heavens into the path of the charging lion. She saw the muscles of&#10;a great arm flash in the light of the equatorial sun as it&#10;filtered, dappling, through the foliage above. She saw a heavy&#10;hunting spear hurtle through the air to meet the lion in&#10;midleap.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Numa brought up upon his haunches, roaring terribly and striking&#10;at the spear which protruded from his breast. His great blows bent&#10;and twisted the weapon. Tarzan, crouching and with hunting knife in&#10;hand, circled warily about the frenzied cat. Momaya, wide-eyed,&#10;stood rooted to the spot, watching, fascinated.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In sudden fury Numa hurled himself toward the ape-man, but the&#10;wiry creature eluded the blundering charge, side-stepping quickly&#10;only to rush in upon his foe. Twice the hunting blade flashed in&#10;the air. Twice it fell upon the back of Numa, already weakening&#10;from the spear point so near his heart. The second stroke of the&#10;blade pierced far into the beast&#39;s spine, and with a last&#10;convulsive sweep of the fore-paws, in a vain attempt to reach his&#10;tormentor, Numa sprawled upon the ground, paralyzed and dying.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Bukawai, fearful lest he should lose any recompense, followed&#10;Momaya with the intention of persuading her to part with her&#10;ornaments of copper and iron against her return with the price of&#10;the medicine&#8212;to pay, as it were, for an option on his services as&#10;one pays a retaining fee to an attorney, for, like an attorney,&#10;Bukawai knew the value of his medicine and that it was well to&#10;collect as much as possible in advance.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The witch-doctor came upon the scene as Tarzan leaped to meet&#10;the lion&#39;s charge. He saw it all and marveled, guessing immediately&#10;that this must be the strange white demon concerning whom he had&#10;heard vague rumors before Momaya came to him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Momaya, now that the lion was past harming her or hers, gazed&#10;with new terror upon Tarzan. It was he who had stolen her Tibo.&#10;Doubtless he would attempt to steal him again. Momaya hugged the&#10;boy close to her. She was determined to die this time rather than&#10;suffer Tibo to be taken from her again.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan eyed them in silence. The sight of the boy clinging,&#10;sobbing, to his mother aroused within his savage breast a&#10;melancholy loneliness. There was none thus to cling to Tarzan, who&#10;yearned so for the love of someone, of something.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At last Tibo looked up, because of the quiet that had fallen&#10;upon the jungle, and saw Tarzan. He did not shrink.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Tarzan,&#34; he said, in the speech of the great apes of the tribe&#10;of Kerchak, &#34;do not take me from Momaya, my mother. Do not take me&#10;again to the lair of the hairy, tree men, for I fear Taug and Gunto&#10;and the others. Let me stay with Momaya, O Tarzan, God of the&#10;Jungle! Let me stay with Momaya, my mother, and to the end of our&#10;days we will bless you and put food before the gates of the village&#10;of Mbonga that you may never hunger.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan sighed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Go,&#34; he said, &#34;back to the village of Mbonga, and Tarzan will&#10;follow to see that no harm befalls you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tibo translated the words to his mother, and the two turned&#10;their backs upon the ape-man and started off toward home. In the&#10;heart of Momaya was a great fear and a great exultation, for never&#10;before had she walked with God, and never had she been so happy.&#10;She strained little Tibo to her, stroking his thin cheek. Tarzan&#10;saw and sighed again.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;For Teeka there is Teeka&#39;s balu,&#34; he soliloquized; &#34;for Sabor&#10;there are balus, and for the she-Gomangani, and for Bara, and for&#10;Manu, and even for Pamba, the rat; but for Tarzan there can be&#10;none&#8212;neither a she nor a balu. Tarzan of the Apes is a man, and it&#10;must be that man walks alone.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Bukawai saw them go, and he mumbled through his rotting face,&#10;swearing a great oath that he would yet have the three fat goats,&#10;the new sleeping mat, and the bit of copper wire.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 15, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/943')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Witch-Doctor Seeks Vengeance'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;LORD GREYSTOKE was hunting, or, to be more accurate, he was&#10;shooting pheasants at Chamston-Hedding. Lord Greystoke was&#10;immaculately and appropriately garbed&#8212;to the minutest detail he was&#10;vogue. To be sure, he was among the forward guns, not being&#10;considered a sporting shot, but what he lacked in skill he more&#10;than made up in appearance. At the end of the day he would,&#10;doubtless, have many birds to his credit, since he had two guns and&#10;a smart loader&#8212; many more birds than he could eat in a year, even&#10;had he been hungry, which he was not, having but just arisen from&#10;the breakfast table.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The beaters&#8212;there were twenty-three of them, in white smocks&#8212;had&#10;but just driven the birds into a patch of gorse, and were now&#10;circling to the opposite side that they might drive down toward the&#10;guns. Lord Greystoke was quite as excited as he ever permitted&#10;himself to become. There was an exhilaration in the sport that&#10;would not be denied. He felt his blood tingling through his veins&#10;as the beaters approached closer and closer to the birds. In a&#10;vague and stupid sort of way Lord Greystoke felt, as he always felt&#10;upon such occasions, that he was experiencing a sensation somewhat&#10;akin to a reversion to a prehistoric type&#8212;that the blood of an&#10;ancient forbear was coursing hot through him, a hairy, half-naked&#10;forbear who had lived by the hunt.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And far away in a matted equatorial jungle another Lord&#10;Greystoke, the real Lord Greystoke, hunted. By the standards which&#10;he knew, he, too, was vogue&#8212;utterly vogue, as was the primal&#10;ancestor before the first eviction. The day being sultry, the&#10;leopard skin had been left behind. The real Lord Greystoke had not&#10;two guns, to be sure, nor even one, neither did he have a smart&#10;loader; but he possessed something infinitely more efficacious than&#10;guns, or loaders, or even twenty-three beaters in white smocks&#8212;he&#10;possessed an appetite, an uncanny woodcraft, and muscles that were&#10;as steel springs.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Later that day, in England, a Lord Greystoke ate bountifully of&#10;things he had not killed, and he drank other things which were&#10;uncorked to the accompaniment of much noise. He patted his lips&#10;with snowy linen to remove the faint traces of his repast, quite&#10;ignorant of the fact that he was an impostor and that the rightful&#10;owner of his noble title was even then finishing his own dinner in&#10;far-off Africa. He was not using snowy linen, though. Instead he&#10;drew the back of a brown forearm and hand across his mouth and&#10;wiped his bloody fingers upon his thighs. Then he moved slowly&#10;through the jungle to the drinking place, where, upon all fours, he&#10;drank as drank his fellows, the other beasts of the jungle.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As he quenched his thirst, another denizen of the gloomy forest&#10;approached the stream along the path behind him. It was Numa, the&#10;lion, tawny of body and black of mane, scowling and sinister,&#10;rumbling out low, coughing roars. Tarzan of the Apes heard him long&#10;before he came within sight, but the ape-man went on with his&#10;drinking until he had had his fill; then he arose, slowly, with the&#10;easy grace of a creature of the wilds and all the quiet dignity&#10;that was his birthright.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Numa halted as he saw the man standing at the very spot where&#10;the king would drink. His jaws were parted, and his cruel eyes&#10;gleamed. He growled and advanced slowly. The man growled, too,&#10;backing slowly to one side, and watching, not the lion&#39;s face, but&#10;its tail. Should that commence to move from side to side in quick,&#10;nervous jerks, it would be well to be upon the alert, and should it&#10;rise suddenly erect, straight and stiff, then one might prepare to&#10;fight or flee; but it did neither, so Tarzan merely backed away and&#10;the lion came down and drank scarce fifty feet from where the man&#10;stood.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tomorrow they might be at one another&#39;s throats, but today there&#10;existed one of those strange and inexplicable truces which so often&#10;are seen among the savage ones of the jungle. Before Numa had&#10;finished drinking, Tarzan had returned into the forest, and was&#10;swinging away in the direction of the village of Mbonga, the black&#10;chief.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It had been at least a moon since the ape-man had called upon&#10;the Gomangani. Not since he had restored little Tibo to his&#10;grief-stricken mother had the whim seized him to do so. The&#10;incident of the adopted balu was a closed one to Tarzan. He had&#10;sought to find something upon which to lavish such an affection as&#10;Teeka lavished upon her balu, but a short experience of the little&#10;black boy had made it quite plain to the ape-man that no such&#10;sentiment could exist between them.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The fact that he had for a time treated the little black as he&#10;might have treated a real balu of his own had in no way altered the&#10;vengeful sentiments with which he considered the murderers of Kala.&#10;The Gomangani were his deadly enemies, nor could they ever be aught&#10;else. Today he looked forward to some slight relief from the&#10;monotony of his existence in such excitement as he might derive&#10;from baiting the blacks.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was not yet dark when he reached the village and took his&#10;place in the great tree overhanging the palisade. From beneath came&#10;a great wailing out of the depths of a near-by hut. The noise fell&#10;disagreeably upon Tarzan&#39;s ears&#8212;it jarred and grated. He did not&#10;like it, so he decided to go away for a while in the hopes that it&#10;might cease; but though he was gone for a couple of hours the&#10;wailing still continued when he returned.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With the intention of putting a violent termination to the&#10;annoying sound, Tarzan slipped silently from the tree into the&#10;shadows beneath. Creeping stealthily and keeping well in the cover&#10;of other huts, he approached that from which rose the sounds of&#10;lamentation. A fire burned brightly before the doorway as it did&#10;before other doorways in the village. A few females squatted about,&#10;occasionally adding their own mournful howlings to those of the&#10;master artist within.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The ape-man smiled a slow smile as he thought of the&#10;consternation which would follow the quick leap that would carry&#10;him among the females and into the full light of the fire. Then he&#10;would dart into the hut during the excitement, throttle the chief&#10;screamer, and be gone into the jungle before the blacks could&#10;gather their scattered nerves for an assault.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Many times had Tarzan behaved similarly in the village of&#10;Mbonga, the chief. His mysterious and unexpected appearances always&#10;filled the breasts of the poor, superstitious blacks with the panic&#10;of terror; never, it seemed, could they accustom themselves to the&#10;sight of him. It was this terror which lent to the adventures the&#10;spice of interest and amusement which the human mind of the ape-man&#10;craved. Merely to kill was not in itself sufficient. Accustomed to&#10;the sight of death, Tarzan found no great pleasure in it. Long&#10;since had he avenged the death of Kala, but in the accomplishment&#10;of it, he had learned the excitement and the pleasure to be derived&#10;from the baiting of the blacks. Of this he never tired.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was just as he was about to spring forward with a savage roar&#10;that a figure appeared in the doorway of the hut. It was the figure&#10;of the wailer whom he had come to still, the figure of a young&#10;woman with a wooden skewer through the split septum of her nose,&#10;with a heavy metal ornament depending from her lower lip, which it&#10;had dragged down to hideous and repulsive deformity, with strange&#10;tattooing upon forehead, cheeks, and breasts, and a wonderful&#10;coiffure built up with mud and wire.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A sudden flare of the fire threw the grotesque figure into high&#10;relief, and Tarzan recognized her as Momaya, the mother of Tibo.&#10;The fire also threw out a fitful flame which carried to the shadows&#10;where Tarzan lurked, picking out his light brown body from the&#10;surrounding darkness. Momaya saw him and knew him. With a cry, she&#10;leaped forward and Tarzan came to meet her. The other women,&#10;turning, saw him, too; but they did not come toward him. Instead&#10;they rose as one, shrieked as one, fled as one.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Momaya threw herself at Tarzan&#39;s feet, raising supplicating&#10;hands toward him and pouring forth from her mutilated lips a&#10;perfect cataract of words, not one of which the ape-man&#10;comprehended. For a moment he looked down upon the upturned,&#10;frightful face of the woman. He had come to slay, but that&#10;overwhelming torrent of speech filled him with consternation and&#10;with awe. He glanced about him apprehensively, then back at the&#10;woman. A revulsion of feeling seized him. He could not kill little&#10;Tibo&#39;s mother, nor could he stand and face this verbal geyser. With&#10;a quick gesture of impatience at the spoiling of his evening&#39;s&#10;entertainment, he wheeled and leaped away into the darkness. A&#10;moment later he was swinging through the black jungle night, the&#10;cries and lamentations of Momaya growing fainter in the&#10;distance.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was with a sigh of relief that he finally reached a point&#10;from which he could no longer hear them, and finding a comfortable&#10;crotch high among the trees, composed himself for a night of&#10;dreamless slumber, while a prowling lion moaned and coughed beneath&#10;him, and in far-off England the other Lord Greystoke, with the&#10;assistance of a valet, disrobed and crawled between spotless&#10;sheets, swearing irritably as a cat meowed beneath his window.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As Tarzan followed the fresh spoor of Horta, the boar, the&#10;following morning, he came upon the tracks of two Gomangani, a&#10;large one and a small one. The ape-man, accustomed as he was to&#10;questioning closely all that fell to his perceptions, paused to&#10;read the story written in the soft mud of the game trail. You or I&#10;would have seen little of interest there, even if, by chance, we&#10;could have seen aught. Perhaps had one been there to point them out&#10;to us, we might have noted indentations in the mud, but there were&#10;countless indentations, one overlapping another into a confusion&#10;that would have been entirely meaningless to us. To Tarzan each&#10;told its own story. Tantor, the elephant, had passed that way as&#10;recently as three suns since. Numa had hunted here the night just&#10;gone, and Horta, the boar, had walked slowly along the trail within&#10;an hour; but what held Tarzan&#39;s attention was the spoor tale of the&#10;Gomangani. It told him that the day before an old man had gone&#10;toward the north in company with a little boy, and that with them&#10;had been two hyenas.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan scratched his head in puzzled incredulity. He could see&#10;by the overlapping of the footprints that the beasts had not been&#10;following the two, for sometimes one was ahead of them and one&#10;behind, and again both were in advance, or both were in the rear.&#10;It was very strange and quite inexplicable, especially where the&#10;spoor showed where the hyenas in the wider portions of the path had&#10;walked one on either side of the human pair, quite close to them.&#10;Then Tarzan read in the spoor of the smaller Gomangani a shrinking&#10;terror of the beast that brushed his side, but in that of the old&#10;man was no sign of fear.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At first Tarzan had been solely occupied by the remarkable&#10;juxtaposition of the spoor of Dango and Gomangani, but now his keen&#10;eyes caught something in the spoor of the little Gomangani which&#10;brought him to a sudden stop. It was as though, finding a letter in&#10;the road, you suddenly had discovered in it the familiar&#10;handwriting of a friend.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Go-bu-balu!&#34; exclaimed the ape-man, and at once memory flashed&#10;upon the screen of recollection the supplicating attitude of Momaya&#10;as she had hurled herself before him in the village of Mbonga the&#10;night before. Instantly all was explained&#8212;the wailing and&#10;lamentation, the pleading of the black mother, the sympathetic&#10;howling of the shes about the fire. Little Go-bu-balu had been&#10;stolen again, and this time by another than Tarzan. Doubtless the&#10;mother had thought that he was again in the power of Tarzan of the&#10;Apes, and she had been beseeching him to return her balu to&#10;her.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Yes, it was all quite plain now; but who could have stolen&#10;Go-bu-balu this time? Tarzan wondered, and he wondered, too, about&#10;the presence of Dango. He would investigate. The spoor was a day&#10;old and it ran toward the north. Tarzan set out to follow it. In&#10;places it was totally obliterated by the passage of many beasts,&#10;and where the way was rocky, even Tarzan of the Apes was almost&#10;baffled; but there was still the faint effluvium which clung to the&#10;human spoor, appreciable only to such highly trained perceptive&#10;powers as were Tarzan&#39;s.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It had all happened to little Tibo very suddenly and&#10;unexpectedly within the brief span of two suns. First had come&#10;Bukawai, the witch-doctor&#8212;Bukawai, the unclean&#8212;with the ragged bit&#10;of flesh which still clung to his rotting face. He had come alone&#10;and by day to the place at the river where Momaya went daily to&#10;wash her body and that of Tibo, her little boy. He had stepped out&#10;from behind a great bush quite close to Momaya, frightening little&#10;Tibo so that he ran screaming to his mother&#39;s protecting arms.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But Momaya, though startled, had wheeled to face the fearsome&#10;thing with all the savage ferocity of a she-tiger at bay. When she&#10;saw who it was, she breathed a sigh of partial relief, though she&#10;still clung tightly to Tibo.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I have come,&#34; said Bukawai without preliminary, &#34;for the three&#10;fat goats, the new sleeping mat, and the bit of copper wire as long&#10;as a tall man&#39;s arm.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I have no goats for you,&#34; snapped Momaya, &#34;nor a sleeping mat,&#10;nor any wire. Your medicine was never made. The white jungle god&#10;gave me back my Tibo. You had nothing to do with it.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But I did,&#34; mumbled Bukawai through his fleshless jaws. &#34;It was&#10;I who commanded the white jungle god to give back your Tibo.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Momaya laughed in his face. &#34;Speaker of lies,&#34; she cried, &#34;go&#10;back to your foul den and your hyenas. Go back and hide your&#10;stinking face in the belly of the mountain, lest the sun, seeing&#10;it, cover his face with a black cloud.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I have come,&#34; reiterated Bukawai, &#34;for the three fat goats, the&#10;new sleeping mat, and the bit of copper wire the length of a tall&#10;man&#39;s arm, which you were to pay me for the return of your&#10;Tibo.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It was to be the length of a man&#39;s forearm,&#34; corrected Momaya,&#10;&#34;but you shall have nothing, old thief. You would not make medicine&#10;until I had brought the payment in advance, and when I was&#10;returning to my village the great, white jungle god gave me back my&#10;Tibo&#8212;gave him to me out of the jaws of Numa. His medicine is true&#10;medicine&#8212; yours is the weak medicine of an old man with a hole in&#10;his face.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I have come,&#34; repeated Bukawai patiently, &#34;for the three fat&#8212;&#34;&#10;But Momaya had not waited to hear more of what she already knew by&#10;heart. Clasping Tibo close to her side, she was hurrying away&#10;toward the palisaded village of Mbonga, the chief.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And the next day, when Momaya was working in the plantain field&#10;with others of the women of the tribe, and little Tibo had been&#10;playing at the edge of the jungle, casting a small spear in&#10;anticipation of the distant day when he should be a full-fledged&#10;warrior, Bukawai had come again.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tibo had seen a squirrel scampering up the bole of a great tree.&#10;His childish mind had transformed it into the menacing figure of a&#10;hostile warrior. Little Tibo had raised his tiny spear, his heart&#10;filled with the savage blood lust of his race, as he pictured the&#10;night&#39;s orgy when he should dance about the corpse of his human&#10;kill as the women of his tribe prepared the meat for the feast to&#10;follow.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But when he cast the spear, he missed both squirrel and tree,&#10;losing his missile far among the tangled undergrowth of the jungle.&#10;However, it could be but a few steps within the forbidden&#10;labyrinth. The women were all about in the field. There were&#10;warriors on guard within easy hail, and so little Tibo boldly&#10;ventured into the dark place.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Just behind the screen of creepers and matted foliage lurked&#10;three horrid figures&#8212;an old, old man, black as the pit, with a face&#10;half eaten away by leprosy, his sharp-filed teeth, the teeth of a&#10;cannibal, showing yellow and repulsive through the great gaping&#10;hole where his mouth and nose had been. And beside him, equally&#10;hideous, stood two powerful hyenas&#8212;carrion-eaters consorting with&#10;carrion.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tibo did not see them until, head down, he had forced his way&#10;through the thickly growing vines in search of his little spear,&#10;and then it was too late. As he looked up into the face of Bukawai,&#10;the old witch-doctor seized him, muffling his screams with a palm&#10;across his mouth. Tibo struggled futilely.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A moment later he was being hustled away through the dark and&#10;terrible jungle, the frightful old man still muffling his screams,&#10;and the two hideous hyenas pacing now on either side, now before,&#10;now behind, always prowling, always growling, snapping, snarling,&#10;or, worst of all, laughing hideously.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;To little Tibo, who within his brief existence had passed&#10;through such experiences as are given to few to pass through in a&#10;lifetime, the northward journey was a nightmare of terror. He&#10;thought now of the time that he had been with the great, white&#10;jungle god, and he prayed with all his little soul that he might be&#10;back again with the white-skinned giant who consorted with the&#10;hairy tree men. Terror-stricken he had been then, but his&#10;surroundings had been nothing by comparison with those which he now&#10;endured.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The old man seldom addressed Tibo, though he kept up an almost&#10;continuous mumbling throughout the long day. Tibo caught repeated&#10;references to fat goats, sleeping mats, and pieces of copper wire.&#10;&#34;Ten fat goats, ten fat goats,&#34; the old Negro would croon over and&#10;over again. By this little Tibo guessed that the price of his&#10;ransom had risen. Ten fat goats? Where would his mother get ten fat&#10;goats, or thin ones, either, for that matter, to buy back just a&#10;poor little boy? Mbonga would never let her have them, and Tibo&#10;knew that his father never had owned more than three goats at the&#10;same time in all his life. Ten fat goats! Tibo sniffled. The putrid&#10;old man would kill him and eat him, for the goats would never be&#10;forthcoming. Bukawai would throw his bones to the hyenas. The&#10;little black boy shuddered and became so weak that he almost fell&#10;in his tracks. Bukawai cuffed him on an ear and jerked him&#10;along.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;After what seemed an eternity to Tibo, they arrived at the mouth&#10;of a cave between two rocky hills. The opening was low and narrow.&#10;A few saplings bound together with strips of rawhide closed it&#10;against stray beasts. Bukawai removed the primitive door and pushed&#10;Tibo within. The hyenas, snarling, rushed past him and were lost to&#10;view in the blackness of the interior. Bukawai replaced the&#10;saplings and seizing Tibo roughly by the arm, dragged him along a&#10;narrow, rocky passage. The floor was comparatively smooth, for the&#10;dirt which lay thick upon it had been trodden and tramped by many&#10;feet until few inequalities remained.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The passage was tortuous, and as it was very dark and the walls&#10;rough and rocky, Tibo was scratched and bruised from the many bumps&#10;he received. Bukawai walked as rapidly through the winding gallery&#10;as one would traverse a familiar lane by daylight. He knew every&#10;twist and turn as a mother knows the face of her child, and he&#10;seemed to be in a hurry. He jerked poor little Tibo possibly a&#10;trifle more ruthlessly than necessary even at the pace Bukawai set;&#10;but the old witch-doctor, an outcast from the society of man,&#10;diseased, shunned, hated, feared, was far from possessing an&#10;angelic temper. Nature had given him few of the kindlier&#10;characteristics of man, and these few Fate had eradicated entirely.&#10;Shrewd, cunning, cruel, vindictive, was Bukawai, the&#10;witch-doctor.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Frightful tales were whispered of the cruel tortures he&#10;inflicted upon his victims. Children were frightened into obedience&#10;by the threat of his name. Often had Tibo been thus frightened, and&#10;now he was reaping a grisly harvest of terror from the seeds his&#10;mother had innocently sown. The darkness, the presence of the&#10;dreaded witch-doctor, the pain of the contusions, with a haunting&#10;premonition of the future, and the fear of the hyenas combined to&#10;almost paralyze the child. He stumbled and reeled until Bukawai was&#10;dragging rather than leading him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Presently Tibo saw a faint lightness ahead of them, and a moment&#10;later they emerged into a roughly circular chamber to which a&#10;little daylight filtered through a rift in the rocky ceiling. The&#10;hyenas were there ahead of them, waiting. As Bukawai entered with&#10;Tibo, the beasts slunk toward them, baring yellow fangs. They were&#10;hungry. Toward Tibo they came, and one snapped at his naked legs.&#10;Bukawai seized a stick from the floor of the chamber and struck a&#10;vicious blow at the beast, at the same time mumbling forth a volley&#10;of execrations. The hyena dodged and ran to the side of the&#10;chamber, where he stood growling. Bukawai took a step toward the&#10;creature, which bristled with rage at his approach. Fear and hatred&#10;shot from its evil eyes, but, fortunately for Bukawai, fear&#10;predominated.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Seeing that he was unnoticed, the second beast made a short,&#10;quick rush for Tibo. The child screamed and darted after the&#10;witch-doctor, who now turned his attention to the second hyena.&#10;This one he reached with his heavy stick, striking it repeatedly&#10;and driving it to the wall. There the two carrion-eaters commenced&#10;to circle the chamber while the human carrion, their master, now in&#10;a perfect frenzy of demoniacal rage, ran to and fro in an effort to&#10;intercept them, striking out with his cudgel and lashing them with&#10;his tongue, calling down upon them the curses of whatever gods and&#10;demons he could summon to memory, and describing in lurid figures&#10;the ignominy of their ancestors.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Several times one or the other of the beasts would turn to make&#10;a stand against the witch-doctor, and then Tibo would hold his&#10;breath in agonized terror, for never in his brief life had he seen&#10;such frightful hatred depicted upon the countenance of man or&#10;beast; but always fear overcame the rage of the savage creatures,&#10;so that they resumed their flight, snarling and bare-fanged, just&#10;at the moment that Tibo was certain they would spring at Bukawai&#39;s&#10;throat.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At last the witch-doctor tired of the futile chase. With a snarl&#10;quite as bestial as those of the beast, he turned toward Tibo. &#34;I&#10;go to collect the ten fat goats, the new sleeping mat, and the two&#10;pieces of copper wire that your mother will pay for the medicine I&#10;shall make to bring you back to her,&#34; he said. &#34;You will stay here.&#10;There,&#34; and he pointed toward the passage which they had followed&#10;to the chamber, &#34;I will leave the hyenas. If you try to escape,&#10;they will eat you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He cast aside the stick and called to the beasts. They came,&#10;snarling and slinking, their tails between their legs. Bukawai led&#10;them to the passage and drove them into it. Then he dragged a rude&#10;lattice into place before the opening after he, himself, had left&#10;the chamber. &#34;This will keep them from you,&#34; he said. &#34;If I do not&#10;get the ten fat goats and the other things, they shall at least&#10;have a few bones after I am through.&#34; And he left the boy to think&#10;over the meaning of his all-too-suggestive words.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When he was gone, Tibo threw himself upon the earth floor and&#10;broke into childish sobs of terror and loneliness. He knew that his&#10;mother had no ten fat goats to give and that when Bukawai returned,&#10;little Tibo would be killed and eaten. How long he lay there he did&#10;not know, but presently he was aroused by the growling of the&#10;hyenas. They had returned through the passage and were glaring at&#10;him from beyond the lattice. He could see their yellow eyes blazing&#10;through the darkness. They reared up and clawed at the barrier.&#10;Tibo shivered and withdrew to the opposite side of the chamber. He&#10;saw the lattice sag and sway to the attacks of the beasts.&#10;Momentarily he expected that it would fall inward, letting the&#10;creatures upon him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Wearily the horror-ridden hours dragged their slow way. Night&#10;came, and for a time Tibo slept, but it seemed that the hungry&#10;beasts never slept. Always they stood just beyond the lattice&#10;growling their hideous growls or laughing their hideous laughs.&#10;Through the narrow rift in the rocky roof above him, Tibo could see&#10;a few stars, and once the moon crossed. At last daylight came&#10;again. Tibo was very hungry and thirsty, for he had not eaten since&#10;the morning before, and only once upon the long march had he been&#10;permitted to drink, but even hunger and thirst were almost&#10;forgotten in the terror of his position.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was after daylight that the child discovered a second opening&#10;in the walls of the subterranean chamber, almost opposite that at&#10;which the hyenas still stood glaring hungrily at him. It was only a&#10;narrow slit in the rocky wall. It might lead in but a few feet, or&#10;it might lead to freedom! Tibo approached it and looked within. He&#10;could see nothing. He extended his arm into the blackness, but he&#10;dared not venture farther. Bukawai never would have left open a way&#10;of escape, Tibo reasoned, so this passage must lead either nowhere&#10;or to some still more hideous danger.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;To the boy&#39;s fear of the actual dangers which menaced&#10;him&#8212;Bukawai and the two hyenas&#8212;his superstition added countless&#10;others quite too horrible even to name, for in the lives of the&#10;blacks, through the shadows of the jungle day and the black horrors&#10;of the jungle night, flit strange, fantastic shapes peopling the&#10;already hideously peopled forests with menacing figures, as though&#10;the lion and the leopard, the snake and the hyena, and the&#10;countless poisonous insects were not quite sufficient to strike&#10;terror to the hearts of the poor, simple creatures whose lot is&#10;cast in earth&#39;s most fearsome spot.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And so it was that little Tibo cringed not only from real&#10;menaces but from imaginary ones. He was afraid even to venture upon&#10;a road that might lead to escape, lest Bukawai had set to watch it&#10;some frightful demon of the jungle.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But the real menaces suddenly drove the imaginary ones from the&#10;boy&#39;s mind, for with the coming of daylight the half-famished&#10;hyenas renewed their efforts to break down the frail barrier which&#10;kept them from their prey. Rearing upon their hind feet they clawed&#10;and struck at the lattice. With wide eyes Tibo saw it sag and rock.&#10;Not for long, he knew, could it withstand the assaults of these two&#10;powerful and determined brutes. Already one corner had been forced&#10;past the rocky protuberance of the entrance way which had held it&#10;in place. A shaggy forearm protruded into the chamber. Tibo&#10;trembled as with ague, for he knew that the end was near.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Backing against the farther wall he stood flattened out as far&#10;from the beasts as he could get. He saw the lattice give still&#10;more. He saw a savage, snarling head forced past it, and grinning&#10;jaws snapping and gaping toward him. In another instant the pitiful&#10;fabric would fall inward, and the two would be upon him, rending&#10;his flesh from his bones, gnawing the bones themselves, fighting&#10;for possession of his entrails.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Bukawai came upon Momaya outside the palisade of Mbonga, the&#10;chief. At sight of him the woman drew back in revulsion, then she&#10;flew at him, tooth and nail; but Bukawai threatening her with a&#10;spear held her at a safe distance.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Where is my baby?&#34; she cried. &#34;Where is my little Tibo?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Bukawai opened his eyes in well-simulated amazement. &#34;Your&#10;baby!&#34; he exclaimed. &#34;What should I know of him, other than that I&#10;rescued him from the white god of the jungle and have not yet&#10;received my pay. I come for the goats and the sleeping mat and the&#10;piece of copper wire the length of a tall man&#39;s arm from the&#10;shoulder to the tips of his fingers.&#34; &#34;Offal of a hyena!&#34; shrieked&#10;Momaya. &#34;My child has been stolen, and you, rotting fragment of a&#10;man, have taken him. Return him to me or I shall tear your eyes&#10;from your head and feed your heart to the wild hogs.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Bukawai shrugged his shoulders. &#34;What do I know about your&#10;child?&#34; he asked. &#34;I have not taken him. If he is stolen again,&#10;what should Bukawai know of the matter? Did Bukawai steal him&#10;before? No, the white jungle god stole him, and if he stole him&#10;once he would steal him again. It is nothing to me. I returned him&#10;to you before and I have come for my pay. If he is gone and you&#10;would have him returned, Bukawai will return him&#8212;for ten fat goats,&#10;a new sleeping mat and two pieces of copper wire the length of a&#10;tall man&#39;s arm from the shoulder to the tips of his fingers, and&#10;Bukawai will say nothing more about the goats and the sleeping mat&#10;and the copper wire which you were to pay for the first&#10;medicine.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ten fat goats!&#34; screamed Momaya. &#34;I could not pay you ten fat&#10;goats in as many years. Ten fat goats, indeed!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ten fat goats,&#34; repeated Bukawai. &#34;Ten fat goats, the new&#10;sleeping mat and two pieces of copper wire the length of&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Momaya stopped him with an impatient gesture. &#34;Wait! she cried.&#10;&#34;I have no goats. You waste your breath. Stay here while I go to my&#10;man. He has but three goats, yet something may be done. Wait!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Bukawai sat down beneath a tree. He felt quite content, for he&#10;knew that he should have either payment or revenge. He did not fear&#10;harm at the hands of these people of another tribe, although he&#10;well knew that they must fear and hate him. His leprosy alone would&#10;prevent their laying hands upon him, while his reputation as a&#10;witch-doctor rendered him doubly immune from attack. He was&#10;planning upon compelling them to drive the ten goats to the mouth&#10;of his cave when Momaya returned. With her were three warriors&#8212;&#10;Mbonga, the chief, Rabba Kega, the village witch-doctor, and Ibeto,&#10;Tibo&#39;s father. They were not pretty men even under ordinary&#10;circumstances, and now, with their faces marked by anger, they well&#10;might have inspired terror in the heart of anyone; but if Bukawai&#10;felt any fear, he did not betray it. Instead he greeted them with&#10;an insolent stare, intended to awe them, as they came and squatted&#10;in a semi-circle before him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Where is Ibeto&#39;s son?&#34; asked Mbonga.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;How should I know?&#34; returned Bukawai. &#34;Doubtless the white&#10;devil-god has him. If I am paid I will make strong medicine and&#10;then we shall know where is Ibeto&#39;s son, and shall get him back&#10;again. It was my medicine which got him back the last time, for&#10;which I got no pay.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I have my own witch-doctor to make medicine,&#34; replied Mbonga&#10;with dignity.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Bukawai sneered and rose to his feet. &#34;Very well,&#34; he said, &#34;let&#10;him make his medicine and see if he can bring Ibeto&#39;s son back.&#34; He&#10;took a few steps away from them, and then he turned angrily back.&#10;&#34;His medicine will not bring the child back&#8212;that I know, and I also&#10;know that when you find him it will be too late for any medicine to&#10;bring him back, for he will be dead. This have I just found out,&#10;the ghost of my father&#39;s sister but now came to me and told&#10;me.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now Mbonga and Rabba Kega might not take much stock in their own&#10;magic, and they might even be skeptical as to the magic of another;&#10;but there was always a chance of SOMETHING being in it, especially&#10;if it were not their own. Was it not well known that old Bukawai&#10;had speech with the demons themselves and that two even lived with&#10;him in the forms of hyenas! Still they must not accede too hastily.&#10;There was the price to be considered, and Mbonga had no intention&#10;of parting lightly with ten goats to obtain the return of a single&#10;little boy who might die of smallpox long before he reached a&#10;warrior&#39;s estate.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Wait,&#34; said Mbonga. &#34;Let us see some of your magic, that we may&#10;know if it be good magic. Then we can talk about payment. Rabba&#10;Kega will make some magic, too. We will see who makes the best&#10;magic. Sit down, Bukawai.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The payment will be ten goats&#8212;fat goats&#8212;a new sleeping mat and&#10;two pieces of copper wire the length of a tall man&#39;s arm from the&#10;shoulder to the ends of his fingers, and it will be made in&#10;advance, the goats being driven to my cave. Then will I make the&#10;medicine, and on the second day the boy will be returned to his&#10;mother. It cannot be done more quickly than that because it takes&#10;time to make such strong medicine.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Make us some medicine now,&#34; said Mbonga. &#34;Let us see what sort&#10;of medicine you make.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Bring me fire,&#34; replied Bukawai, &#34;and I will make you a little&#10;magic.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Momaya was dispatched for the fire, and while she was away&#10;Mbonga dickered with Bukawai about the price. Ten goats, he said,&#10;was a high price for an able-bodied warrior. He also called&#10;Bukawai&#39;s attention to the fact that he, Mbonga, was very poor,&#10;that his people were very poor, and that ten goats were at least&#10;eight too many, to say nothing of a new sleeping mat and the copper&#10;wire; but Bukawai was adamant. His medicine was very expensive and&#10;he would have to give at least five goats to the gods who helped&#10;him make it. They were still arguing when Momaya returned with the&#10;fire.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Bukawai placed a little on the ground before him, took a pinch&#10;of powder from a pouch at his side and sprinkled it on the embers.&#10;A cloud of smoke rose with a puff. Bukawai closed his eyes and&#10;rocked back and forth. Then he made a few passes in the air and&#10;pretended to swoon. Mbonga and the others were much impressed.&#10;Rabba Kega grew nervous. He saw his reputation waning. There was&#10;some fire left in the vessel which Momaya had brought. He seized&#10;the vessel, dropped a handful of dry leaves into it while no one&#10;was watching and then uttered a frightful scream which drew the&#10;attention of Bukawai&#39;s audience to him. It also brought Bukawai&#10;quite miraculously out of his swoon, but when the old witch-doctor&#10;saw the reason for the disturbance he quickly relapsed into&#10;unconsciousness before anyone discovered his FAUX PAS.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Rabba Kega, seeing that he had the attention of Mbonga, Ibeto,&#10;and Momaya, blew suddenly into the vessel, with the result that the&#10;leaves commenced to smolder, and smoke issued from the mouth of the&#10;receptacle. Rabba Kega was careful to hold it so that none might&#10;see the dry leaves. Their eyes opened wide at this remarkable&#10;demonstration of the village witch-doctor&#39;s powers. The latter,&#10;greatly elated, let himself out. He shouted, jumped up and down,&#10;and made frightful grimaces; then he put his face close over the&#10;mouth of the vessel and appeared to be communing with the spirits&#10;within.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was while he was thus engaged that Bukawai came out of his&#10;trance, his curiosity finally having gotten the better of him. No&#10;one was paying him the slightest attention. He blinked his one eye&#10;angrily, then he, too, let out a loud roar, and when he was sure&#10;that Mbonga had turned toward him, he stiffened rigidly and made&#10;spasmodic movements with his arms and legs.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I see him!&#34; he cried. &#34;He is far away. The white devil-god did&#10;not get him. He is alone and in great danger; but,&#34; he added, &#34;if&#10;the ten fat goats and the other things are paid to me quickly there&#10;is yet time to save him.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Rabba Kega had paused to listen. Mbonga looked toward him. The&#10;chief was in a quandary. He did not know which medicine was the&#10;better. &#34;What does your magic tell you?&#34; he asked of Rabba&#10;Kega.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I, too, see him,&#34; screamed Rabba Kega; &#34;but he is not where&#10;Bukawai says he is. He is dead at the bottom of the river.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At this Momaya commenced to howl loudly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan had followed the spoor of the old man, the two hyenas,&#10;and the little black boy to the mouth of the cave in the rocky&#10;canon between the two hills. Here he paused a moment before the&#10;sapling barrier which Bukawai had set up, listening to the snarls&#10;and growls which came faintly from the far recesses of the&#10;cavern.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Presently, mingled with the beastly cries, there came faintly to&#10;the keen ears of the ape-man, the agonized moan of a child. No&#10;longer did Tarzan hesitate. Hurling the door aside, he sprang into&#10;the dark opening. Narrow and black was the corridor; but long use&#10;of his eyes in the Stygian blackness of the jungle nights had given&#10;to the ape-man something of the nocturnal visionary powers of the&#10;wild things with which he had consorted since babyhood.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He moved rapidly and yet with caution, for the place was dark,&#10;unfamiliar and winding. As he advanced, he heard more and more&#10;loudly the savage snarls of the two hyenas, mingled with the&#10;scraping and scratching of their paws upon wood. The moans of a&#10;child grew in volume, and Tarzan recognized in them the voice of&#10;the little black boy he once had sought to adopt as his balu.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There was no hysteria in the ape-man&#39;s advance. Too accustomed&#10;was he to the passing of life in the jungle to be greatly wrought&#10;even by the death of one whom he knew; but the lust for battle&#10;spurred him on. He was only a wild beast at heart and his wild&#10;beast&#39;s heart beat high in anticipation of conflict.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In the rocky chamber of the hill&#39;s center, little Tibo crouched&#10;low against the wall as far from the hunger-crazed beasts as he&#10;could drag himself. He saw the lattice giving to the frantic&#10;clawing of the hyenas. He knew that in a few minutes his little&#10;life would flicker out horribly beneath the rending, yellow fangs&#10;of these loathsome creatures.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Beneath the buffetings of the powerful bodies, the lattice&#10;sagged inward, until, with a crash it gave way, letting the&#10;carnivora in upon the boy. Tibo cast one affrighted glance toward&#10;them, then closed his eyes and buried his face in his arms, sobbing&#10;piteously.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For a moment the hyenas paused, caution and cowardice holding&#10;them from their prey. They stood thus glaring at the lad, then&#10;slowly, stealthily, crouching, they crept toward him. It was thus&#10;that Tarzan came upon them, bursting into the chamber swiftly and&#10;silently; but not so silently that the keen-eared beasts did not&#10;note his coming. With angry growls they turned from Tibo upon the&#10;ape-man, as, with a smile upon his lips, he ran toward them. For an&#10;instant one of the animals stood its ground; but the ape-man did&#10;not deign even to draw his hunting knife against despised Dango.&#10;Rushing in upon the brute he grasped it by the scruff of the neck,&#10;just as it attempted to dodge past him, and hurled it across the&#10;cavern after its fellow which already was slinking into the&#10;corridor, bent upon escape.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then Tarzan picked Tibo from the floor, and when the child felt&#10;human hands upon him instead of the paws and fangs of the hyenas,&#10;he rolled his eyes upward in surprise and incredulity, and as they&#10;fell upon Tarzan, sobs of relief broke from the childish lips and&#10;his hands clutched at his deliverer as though the white devil-god&#10;was not the most feared of jungle creatures.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When Tarzan came to the cave mouth the hyenas were nowhere in&#10;sight, and after permitting Tibo to quench his thirst in the spring&#10;which rose near by, he lifted the boy to his shoulders and set off&#10;toward the jungle at a rapid trot, determined to still the annoying&#10;howlings of Momaya as quickly as possible, for he shrewdly had&#10;guessed that the absence of her balu was the cause of her&#10;lamentation.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;He is not dead at the bottom of the river,&#34; cried Bukawai.&#10;&#34;What does this fellow know about making magic? Who is he, anyway,&#10;that he dare say Bukawai&#39;s magic is not good magic? Bukawai sees&#10;Momaya&#39;s son. He is far away and alone and in great danger. Hasten&#10;then with the ten fat goats, the&#8212;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But he got no further. There was a sudden interruption from&#10;above, from the branches of the very tree beneath which they&#10;squatted, and as the five blacks looked up they almost swooned in&#10;fright as they saw the great, white devil-god looking down upon&#10;them; but before they could flee they saw another face, that of the&#10;lost little Tibo, and his face was laughing and very happy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And then Tarzan dropped fearlessly among them, the boy still&#10;upon his back, and deposited him before his mother. Momaya, Ibeto,&#10;Rabba Kega, and Mbonga were all crowding around the lad trying to&#10;question him at the same time. Suddenly Momaya turned ferociously&#10;to fall upon Bukawai, for the boy had told her all that he had&#10;suffered at the hands of the cruel old man; but Bukawai was no&#10;longer there&#8212;he had required no recourse to black art to assure him&#10;that the vicinity of Momaya would be no healthful place for him&#10;after Tibo had told his story, and now he was running through the&#10;jungle as fast as his old legs would carry him toward the distant&#10;lair where he knew no black would dare pursue him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan, too, had vanished, as he had a way of doing, to the&#10;mystification of the blacks. Then Momaya&#39;s eyes lighted upon Rabba&#10;Kega. The village witch-doctor saw something in those eyes of hers&#10;which boded no good to him, and backed away.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;So my Tibo is dead at the bottom of the river, is he?&#34; the&#10;woman shrieked. &#34;And he&#39;s far away and alone and in great danger,&#10;is he? Magic!&#34; The scorn which Momaya crowded into that single word&#10;would have done credit to a Thespian of the first magnitude.&#10;&#34;Magic, indeed!&#34; she screamed. &#34;Momaya will show you some magic of&#10;her own,&#34; and with that she seized upon a broken limb and struck&#10;Rabba Kega across the head. With a howl of pain, the man turned and&#10;fled, Momaya pursuing him and beating him across the shoulders,&#10;through the gateway and up the length of the village street, to the&#10;intense amusement of the warriors, the women, and the children who&#10;were so fortunate as to witness the spectacle, for one and all&#10;feared Rabba Kega, and to fear is to hate.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Thus it was that to his host of passive enemies, Tarzan of the&#10;Apes added that day two active foes, both of whom remained awake&#10;long into the night planning means of revenge upon the white&#10;devil-god who had brought them into ridicule and disrepute, but&#10;with their most malevolent schemings was mingled a vein of real&#10;fear and awe that would not down.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Young Lord Greystoke did not know that they planned against him,&#10;nor, knowing, would have cared. He slept as well that night as he&#10;did on any other night, and though there was no roof above him, and&#10;no doors to lock against intruders, he slept much better than his&#10;noble relative in England, who had eaten altogether too much&#10;lobster and drank too much wine at dinner that night.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 15, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/943')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The End of Bukawai'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;WHEN TARZAN OF the Apes was still but a boy he had learned,&#10;among other things, to fashion pliant ropes of fibrous jungle&#10;grass. Strong and tough were the ropes of Tarzan, the little&#10;Tarmangani. Tublat, his foster father, would have told you this&#10;much and more. Had you tempted him with a handful of fat&#10;caterpillars he even might have sufficiently unbended to narrate to&#10;you a few stories of the many indignities which Tarzan had heaped&#10;upon him by means of his hated rope; but then Tublat always worked&#10;himself into such a frightful rage when he devoted any considerable&#10;thought either to the rope or to Tarzan, that it might not have&#10;proved comfortable for you to have remained close enough to him to&#10;hear what he had to say.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So often had that snakelike noose settled unexpectedly over&#10;Tublat&#39;s head, so often had he been jerked ridiculously and&#10;painfully from his feet when he was least looking for such an&#10;occurrence, that there is little wonder he found scant space in his&#10;savage heart for love of his white-skinned foster child, or the&#10;inventions thereof. There had been other times, too, when Tublat&#10;had swung helplessly in midair, the noose tightening about his&#10;neck, death staring him in the face, and little Tarzan dancing upon&#10;a near-by limb, taunting him and making unseemly grimaces.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then there had been another occasion in which the rope had&#10;figured prominently&#8212;an occasion, and the only one connected with&#10;the rope, which Tublat recalled with pleasure. Tarzan, as active in&#10;brain as he was in body, was always inventing new ways in which to&#10;play. It was through the medium of play that he learned much during&#10;his childhood. This day he learned something, and that he did not&#10;lose his life in the learning of it, was a matter of great surprise&#10;to Tarzan, and the fly in the ointment, to Tublat.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The man-child had, in throwing his noose at a playmate in a tree&#10;above him, caught a projecting branch instead. When he tried to&#10;shake it loose it but drew the tighter. Then Tarzan started to&#10;climb the rope to remove it from the branch. When he was part way&#10;up a frolicsome playmate seized that part of the rope which lay&#10;upon the ground and ran off with it as far as he could go. When&#10;Tarzan screamed at him to desist, the young ape released the rope a&#10;little and then drew it tight again. The result was to impart a&#10;swinging motion to Tarzan&#39;s body which the ape-boy suddenly&#10;realized was a new and pleasurable form of play. He urged the ape&#10;to continue until Tarzan was swinging to and fro as far as the&#10;short length of rope would permit, but the distance was not great&#10;enough, and, too, he was not far enough above the ground to give&#10;the necessary thrills which add so greatly to the pastimes of the&#10;young.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So he clambered to the branch where the noose was caught and&#10;after removing it carried the rope far aloft and out upon a long&#10;and powerful branch. Here he again made it fast, and taking the&#10;loose end in his hand, clambered quickly down among the branches as&#10;far as the rope would permit him to go; then he swung out upon the&#10;end of it, his lithe, young body turning and twisting&#8212;a human bob&#10;upon a pendulum of grass&#8212;thirty feet above the ground.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Ah, how delectable! This was indeed a new play of the first&#10;magnitude. Tarzan was entranced. Soon he discovered that by&#10;wriggling his body in just the right way at the proper time he&#10;could diminish or accelerate his oscillation, and, being a boy, he&#10;chose, naturally, to accelerate. Presently he was swinging far and&#10;wide, while below him, the apes of the tribe of Kerchak looked on&#10;in mild amaze.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Had it been you or I swinging there at the end of that grass&#10;rope, the thing which presently happened would not have happened,&#10;for we could not have hung on so long as to have made it possible;&#10;but Tarzan was quite as much at home swinging by his hands as he&#10;was standing upon his feet, or, at least, almost. At any rate he&#10;felt no fatigue long after the time that an ordinary mortal would&#10;have been numb with the strain of the physical exertion. And this&#10;was his undoing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tublat was watching him as were others of the tribe. Of all the&#10;creatures of the wild, there was none Tublat so cordially hated as&#10;he did this hideous, hairless, white-skinned, caricature of an ape.&#10;But for Tarzan&#39;s nimbleness, and the zealous watchfulness of savage&#10;Kala&#39;s mother love, Tublat would long since have rid himself of&#10;this stain upon his family escutcheon. So long had it been since&#10;Tarzan became a member of the tribe, that Tublat had forgotten the&#10;circumstances surrounding the entrance of the jungle waif into his&#10;family, with the result that he now imagined that Tarzan was his&#10;own offspring, adding greatly to his chagrin.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Wide and far swung Tarzan of the Apes, until at last, as he&#10;reached the highest point of the arc the rope, which rapidly had&#10;frayed on the rough bark of the tree limb, parted suddenly. The&#10;watching apes saw the smooth, brown body shoot outward, and down,&#10;plummet-like. Tublat leaped high in the air, emitting what in a&#10;human being would have been an exclamation of delight. This would&#10;be the end of Tarzan and most of Tublat&#39;s troubles. From now on he&#10;could lead his life in peace and security.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan fell quite forty feet, alighting on his back in a thick&#10;bush. Kala was the first to reach his side&#8212;ferocious, hideous,&#10;loving Kala. She had seen the life crushed from her own balu in&#10;just such a fall years before. Was she to lose this one too in the&#10;same way? Tarzan was lying quite still when she found him, embedded&#10;deeply in the bush. It took Kala several minutes to disentangle him&#10;and drag him forth; but he was not killed. He was not even badly&#10;injured. The bush had broken the force of the fall. A cut upon the&#10;back of his head showed where he had struck the tough stem of the&#10;shrub and explained his unconsciousness.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In a few minutes he was as active as ever. Tublat was furious.&#10;In his rage he snapped at a fellow-ape without first discovering&#10;the identity of his victim, and was badly mauled for his ill&#10;temper, having chosen to vent his spite upon a husky and&#10;belligerent young bull in the full prime of his vigor.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But Tarzan had learned something new. He had learned that&#10;continued friction would wear through the strands of his rope,&#10;though it was many years before this knowledge did more for him&#10;than merely to keep him from swinging too long at a time, or too&#10;far above the ground at the end of his rope.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The day came, however, when the very thing that had once all but&#10;killed him proved the means of saving his life.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He was no longer a child, but a mighty jungle male. There was&#10;none now to watch over him, solicitously, nor did he need such.&#10;Kala was dead. Dead, too, was Tublat, and though with Kala passed&#10;the one creature that ever really had loved him, there were still&#10;many who hated him after Tublat departed unto the arms of his&#10;fathers. It was not that he was more cruel or more savage than they&#10;that they hated him, for though he was both cruel and savage as&#10;were the beasts, his fellows, yet too was he often tender, which&#10;they never were. No, the thing which brought Tarzan most into&#10;disrepute with those who did not like him, was the possession and&#10;practice of a characteristic which they had not and could not&#10;understand&#8212; the human sense of humor. In Tarzan it was a trifle&#10;broad, perhaps, manifesting itself in rough and painful practical&#10;jokes upon his friends and cruel baiting of his enemies.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But to neither of these did he owe the enmity of Bukawai, the&#10;witch-doctor, who dwelt in the cave between the two hills far to&#10;the north of the village of Mbonga, the chief. Bukawai was jealous&#10;of Tarzan, and Bukawai it was who came near proving the undoing of&#10;the ape-man. For months Bukawai had nursed his hatred while revenge&#10;seemed remote indeed, since Tarzan of the Apes frequented another&#10;part of the jungle, miles away from the lair of Bukawai. Only once&#10;had the black witch-doctor seen the devil-god, as he was most often&#10;called among the blacks, and upon that occasion Tarzan had robbed&#10;him of a fat fee, at the same time putting the lie in the mouth of&#10;Bukawai, and making his medicine seem poor medicine. All this&#10;Bukawai never could forgive, though it seemed unlikely that the&#10;opportunity would come to be revenged.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Yet it did come, and quite unexpectedly. Tarzan was hunting far&#10;to the north. He had wandered away from the tribe, as he did more&#10;and more often as he approached maturity, to hunt alone for a few&#10;days. As a child he had enjoyed romping and playing with the young&#10;apes, his companions; but now these play-fellows of his had grown&#10;to surly, lowering bulls, or to touchy, suspicious mothers,&#10;jealously guarding helpless balus. So Tarzan found in his own&#10;man-mind a greater and a truer companionship than any or all of the&#10;apes of Kerchak could afford him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;This day, as Tarzan hunted, the sky slowly became overcast. Torn&#10;clouds, whipped to ragged streamers, fled low above the tree tops.&#10;They reminded Tarzan of frightened antelope fleeing the charge of a&#10;hungry lion. But though the light clouds raced so swiftly, the&#10;jungle was motionless. Not a leaf quivered and the silence was a&#10;great, dead weight&#8212; insupportable. Even the insects seemed stilled&#10;by apprehension of some frightful thing impending, and the larger&#10;things were soundless. Such a forest, such a jungle might have&#10;stood there in the beginning of that unthinkably far-gone age&#10;before God peopled the world with life, when there were no sounds&#10;because there were no ears to hear.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And over all lay a sickly, pallid ocher light through which the&#10;scourged clouds raced. Tarzan had seen all these conditions many&#10;times before, yet he never could escape a strange feeling at each&#10;recurrence of them. He knew no fear, but in the face of Nature&#39;s&#10;manifestations of her cruel, immeasurable powers, he felt very&#10;small&#8212;very small and very lonely.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now he heard a low moaning, far away. &#34;The lions seek their&#10;prey,&#34; he murmured to himself, looking up once again at the&#10;swift-flying clouds. The moaning rose to a great volume of sound.&#10;&#34;They come!&#34; said Tarzan of the Apes, and sought the shelter of a&#10;thickly foliaged tree. Quite suddenly the trees bent their tops&#10;simultaneously as though God had stretched a hand from the heavens&#10;and pressed His flat palm down upon the world. &#34;They pass!&#34;&#10;whispered Tarzan. &#34;The lions pass.&#34; Then came a vivid flash of&#10;lightning, followed by deafening thunder. &#34;The lions have sprung,&#34;&#10;cried Tarzan, &#34;and now they roar above the bodies of their&#10;kills.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The trees were waving wildly in all directions now, a perfectly&#10;demoniacal wind threshed the jungle pitilessly. In the midst of it&#10;the rain came&#8212;not as it comes upon us of the northlands, but in a&#10;sudden, choking, blinding deluge. &#34;The blood of the kill,&#34; thought&#10;Tarzan, huddling himself closer to the bole of the great tree&#10;beneath which he stood.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He was close to the edge of the jungle, and at a little distance&#10;he had seen two hills before the storm broke; but now he could see&#10;nothing. It amused him to look out into the beating rain, searching&#10;for the two hills and imagining that the torrents from above had&#10;washed them away, yet he knew that presently the rain would cease,&#10;the sun come out again and all be as it was before, except where a&#10;few branches had fallen and here and there some old and rotted&#10;patriarch had crashed back to enrich the soil upon which he had&#10;fatted for, maybe, centuries. All about him branches and leaves&#10;filled the air or fell to earth, torn away by the strength of the&#10;tornado and the weight of the water upon them. A gaunt corpse&#10;toppled and fell a few yards away; but Tarzan was protected from&#10;all these dangers by the wide-spreading branches of the sturdy&#10;young giant beneath which his jungle craft had guided him. Here&#10;there was but a single danger, and that a remote one. Yet it came.&#10;Without warning the tree above him was riven by lightning, and when&#10;the rain ceased and the sun came out Tarzan lay stretched as he had&#10;fallen, upon his face amidst the wreckage of the jungle giant that&#10;should have shielded him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Bukawai came to the entrance of his cave after the rain and the&#10;storm had passed and looked out upon the scene. From his one eye&#10;Bukawai could see; but had he had a dozen eyes he could have found&#10;no beauty in the fresh sweetness of the revivified jungle, for to&#10;such things, in the chemistry of temperament, his brain failed to&#10;react; nor, even had he had a nose, which he had not for years,&#10;could he have found enjoyment or sweetness in the clean-washed&#10;air.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At either side of the leper stood his sole and constant&#10;companions, the two hyenas, sniffing the air. Presently one of them&#10;uttered a low growl and with flattened head started, sneaking and&#10;wary, toward the jungle. The other followed. Bukawai, his curiosity&#10;aroused, trailed after them, in his hand a heavy knob-stick.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The hyenas halted a few yards from the prostrate Tarzan,&#10;sniffing and growling. Then came Bukawai, and at first he could not&#10;believe the witness of his own eyes; but when he did and saw that&#10;it was indeed the devil-god his rage knew no bounds, for he thought&#10;him dead and himself cheated of the revenge he had so long dreamed&#10;upon.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The hyenas approached the ape-man with bared fangs. Bukawai,&#10;with an inarticulate scream, rushed upon them, striking cruel and&#10;heavy blows with his knob-stick, for there might still be life in&#10;the apparently lifeless form. The beasts, snapping and snarling,&#10;half turned upon their master and their tormentor, but long fear&#10;still held them from his putrid throat. They slunk away a few yards&#10;and squatted upon their haunches, hatred and baffled hunger&#10;gleaming from their savage eyes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Bukawai stooped and placed his ear above the ape-man&#39;s heart. It&#10;still beat. As well as his sloughed features could register&#10;pleasure they did so; but it was not a pretty sight. At the&#10;ape-man&#39;s side lay his long, grass rope. Quickly Bukawai bound the&#10;limp arms behind his prisoner&#39;s back, then he raised him to one of&#10;his shoulders, for, though Bukawai was old and diseased, he was&#10;still a strong man. The hyenas fell in behind as the witch-doctor&#10;set off toward the cave, and through the long black corridors they&#10;followed as Bukawai bore his victim into the bowels of the hills.&#10;Through subterranean chambers, connected by winding passageways,&#10;Bukawai staggered with his load. At a sudden turning of the&#10;corridor, daylight flooded them and Bukawai stepped out into a&#10;small, circular basin in the hill, apparently the crater of an&#10;ancient volcano, one of those which never reached the dignity of a&#10;mountain and are little more than lava-rimmed pits closed to the&#10;earth&#39;s surface.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Steep walls rimmed the cavity. The only exit was through the&#10;passageway by which Bukawai had entered. A few stunted trees grew&#10;upon the rocky floor. A hundred feet above could be seen the ragged&#10;lips of this cold, dead mouth of hell.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Bukawai propped Tarzan against a tree and bound him there with&#10;his own grass rope, leaving his hands free but securing the knots&#10;in such a way that the ape-man could not reach them. The hyenas&#10;slunk to and fro, growling. Bukawai hated them and they hated him.&#10;He knew that they but waited for the time when he should be&#10;helpless, or when their hatred should rise to such a height as to&#10;submerge their cringing fear of him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In his own heart was not a little fear of these repulsive&#10;creatures, and because of that fear, Bukawai always kept the beasts&#10;well fed, often hunting for them when their own forages for food&#10;failed, but ever was he cruel to them with the cruelty of a little&#10;brain, diseased, bestial, primitive.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He had had them since they were puppies. They had known no other&#10;life than that with him, and though they went abroad to hunt,&#10;always they returned. Of late Bukawai had come to believe that they&#10;returned not so much from habit as from a fiendish patience which&#10;would submit to every indignity and pain rather than forego the&#10;final vengeance, and Bukawai needed but little imagination to&#10;picture what that vengeance would be. Today he would see for&#10;himself what his end would be; but another should impersonate&#10;Bukawai.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When he had trussed Tarzan securely, Bukawai went back into the&#10;corridor, driving the hyenas ahead of him, and pulling across the&#10;opening a lattice of laced branches, which shut the pit from the&#10;cave during the night that Bukawai might sleep in security, for&#10;then the hyenas were penned in the crater that they might not sneak&#10;upon a sleeping Bukawai in the darkness.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Bukawai returned to the outer cave mouth, filled a vessel with&#10;water at the spring which rose in the little canon close at hand&#10;and returned toward the pit. The hyenas stood before the lattice&#10;looking hungrily toward Tarzan. They had been fed in this manner&#10;before.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With his water, the witch-doctor approached Tarzan and threw a&#10;portion of the contents of the vessel in the ape-man&#39;s face. There&#10;was fluttering of the eyelids, and at the second application Tarzan&#10;opened his eyes and looked about.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Devil-god,&#34; cried Bukawai, &#34;I am the great witch-doctor. My&#10;medicine is strong. Yours is weak. If it is not, why do you stay&#10;tied here like a goat that is bait for lions?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan understood nothing the witch-doctor said, therefore he&#10;did not reply, but only stared straight at Bukawai with cold and&#10;level gaze. The hyenas crept up behind him. He heard them growl;&#10;but he did not even turn his head. He was a beast with a man&#39;s&#10;brain. The beast in him refused to show fear in the face of a death&#10;which the man-mind already admitted to be inevitable.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Bukawai, not yet ready to give his victim to the beasts, rushed&#10;upon the hyenas with his knob-stick. There was a short scrimmage in&#10;which the brutes came off second best, as they always did. Tarzan&#10;watched it. He saw and realized the hatred which existed between&#10;the two animals and the hideous semblance of a man.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With the hyenas subdued, Bukawai returned to the baiting of&#10;Tarzan; but finding that the ape-man understood nothing he said,&#10;the witch-doctor finally desisted. Then he withdrew into the&#10;corridor and pulled the latticework barrier across the opening. He&#10;went back into the cave and got a sleeping mat, which he brought to&#10;the opening, that he might lie down and watch the spectacle of his&#10;revenge in comfort.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The hyenas were sneaking furtively around the ape-man. Tarzan&#10;strained at his bonds for a moment, but soon realized that the rope&#10;he had braided to hold Numa, the lion, would hold him quite as&#10;successfully. He did not wish to die; but he could look death in&#10;the face now as he had many times before without a quaver.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As he pulled upon the rope he felt it rub against the small tree&#10;about which it was passed. Like a flash of the cinematograph upon&#10;the screen, a picture was flashed before his mind&#39;s eye from the&#10;storehouse of his memory. He saw a lithe, boyish figure swinging&#10;high above the ground at the end of a rope. He saw many apes&#10;watching from below, and then he saw the rope part and the boy&#10;hurtle downward toward the ground. Tarzan smiled. Immediately he&#10;commenced to draw the rope rapidly back and forth across the tree&#10;trunk.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The hyenas, gaining courage, came closer. They sniffed at his&#10;legs; but when he struck at them with his free arms they slunk off.&#10;He knew that with the growth of hunger they would attack. Coolly,&#10;methodically, without haste, Tarzan drew the rope back and forth&#10;against the rough trunk of the small tree.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In the entrance to the cavern Bukawai fell asleep. He thought it&#10;would be some time before the beasts gained sufficient courage or&#10;hunger to attack the captive. Their growls and the cries of the&#10;victim would awaken him. In the meantime he might as well rest, and&#10;he did.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Thus the day wore on, for the hyenas were not famished, and the&#10;rope with which Tarzan was bound was a stronger one than that of&#10;his boyhood, which had parted so quickly to the chafing of the&#10;rough tree bark. Yet, all the while hunger was growing upon the&#10;beasts and the strands of the grass rope were wearing thinner and&#10;thinner. Bukawai slept.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was late afternoon before one of the beasts, irritated by the&#10;gnawing of appetite, made a quick, growling dash at the ape-man.&#10;The noise awoke Bukawai. He sat up quickly and watched what went on&#10;within the crater. He saw the hungry hyena charge the man, leaping&#10;for the unprotected throat. He saw Tarzan reach out and seize the&#10;growling animal, and then he saw the second beast spring for the&#10;devil-god&#39;s shoulder. There was a mighty heave of the great,&#10;smooth-skinned body. Rounded muscles shot into great, tensed piles&#10;beneath the brown hide&#8212;the ape-man surged forward with all his&#10;weight and all his great strength&#8212;the bonds parted, and the three&#10;were rolling upon the floor of the crater snarling, snapping, and&#10;rending.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Bukawai leaped to his feet. Could it be that the devil-god was&#10;to prevail against his servants? Impossible! The creature was&#10;unarmed, and he was down with two hyenas on top of him; but Bukawai&#10;did not know Tarzan.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The ape-man fastened his fingers upon the throat of one of the&#10;hyenas and rose to one knee, though the other beast tore at him&#10;frantically in an effort to pull him down. With a single hand&#10;Tarzan held the one, and with the other hand he reached forth and&#10;pulled toward him the second beast.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And then Bukawai, seeing the battle going against his forces,&#10;rushed forward from the cavern brandishing his knob-stick. Tarzan&#10;saw him coming, and rising now to both feet, a hyena in each hand,&#10;he hurled one of the foaming beasts straight at the witch-doctor&#39;s&#10;head. Down went the two in a snarling, biting heap. Tarzan tossed&#10;the second hyena across the crater, while the first gnawed at the&#10;rotting face of its master; but this did not suit the ape-man. With&#10;a kick he sent the beast howling after its companion, and springing&#10;to the side of the prostrate witch-doctor, dragged him to his&#10;feet.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Bukawai, still conscious, saw death, immediate and terrible, in&#10;the cold eyes of his captor, so he turned upon Tarzan with teeth&#10;and nails. The ape-man shuddered at the proximity of that raw face&#10;to his. The hyenas had had enough and disappeared through the small&#10;aperture leading into the cave. Tarzan had little difficulty in&#10;overpowering and binding Bukawai. Then he led him to the very tree&#10;to which he had been bound; but in binding Bukawai, Tarzan saw to&#10;it that escape after the same fashion that he had escaped would be&#10;out of the question; then he left him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As he passed through the winding corridors and the subterranean&#10;apartments, Tarzan saw nothing of the hyenas.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;They will return,&#34; he said to himself.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In the crater between the towering walls Bukawai, cold with&#10;terror, trembled, trembled as with ague.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;They will return!&#34; he cried, his voice rising to a&#10;fright-filled shriek.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And they did.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 15, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/943')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Lion'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;NUMA, THE LION, crouched behind a thorn bush close beside the&#10;drinking pool where the river eddied just below the bend. There was&#10;a ford there and on either bank a well-worn trail, broadened far&#10;out at the river&#39;s brim, where, for countless centuries, the wild&#10;things of the jungle and of the plains beyond had come down to&#10;drink, the carnivora with bold and fearless majesty, the herbivora&#10;timorous, hesitating, fearful.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Numa, the lion, was hungry, he was very hungry, and so he was&#10;quite silent now. On his way to the drinking place he had moaned&#10;often and roared not a little; but as he neared the spot where he&#10;would lie in wait for Bara, the deer, or Horta, the boar, or some&#10;other of the many luscious-fleshed creatures who came hither to&#10;drink, he was silent. It was a grim, a terrible silence, shot&#10;through with yellow-green light of ferocious eyes, punctuated with&#10;undulating tremors of sinuous tail.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was Pacco, the zebra, who came first, and Numa, the lion,&#10;could scarce restrain a roar of anger, for of all the plains&#10;people, none are more wary than Pacco, the zebra. Behind the&#10;black-striped stallion came a herd of thirty or forty of the plump&#10;and vicious little horselike beasts. As he neared the river, the&#10;leader paused often, cocking his ears and raising his muzzle to&#10;sniff the gentle breeze for the tell-tale scent spoor of the dread&#10;flesh-eaters.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Numa shifted uneasily, drawing his hind quarters far beneath his&#10;tawny body, gathering himself for the sudden charge and the savage&#10;assault. His eyes shot hungry fire. His great muscles quivered to&#10;the excitement of the moment.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Pacco came a little nearer, halted, snorted, and wheeled. There&#10;was a pattering of scurrying hoofs and the herd was gone; but Numa,&#10;the lion, moved not. He was familiar with the ways of Pacco, the&#10;zebra. He knew that he would return, though many times he might&#10;wheel and fly before he summoned the courage to lead his harem and&#10;his offspring to the water. There was the chance that Pacco might&#10;be frightened off entirely. Numa had seen this happen before, and&#10;so he became almost rigid lest he be the one to send them&#10;galloping, waterless, back to the plain.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Again and again came Pacco and his family, and again and again&#10;did they turn and flee; but each time they came closer to the&#10;river, until at last the plump stallion dipped his velvet muzzle&#10;daintily into the water. The others, stepping warily, approached&#10;their leader. Numa selected a sleek, fat filly and his flaming eyes&#10;burned greedily as they feasted upon her, for Numa, the lion, loves&#10;scarce anything better than the meat of Pacco, perhaps because&#10;Pacco is, of all the grass-eaters, the most difficult to catch.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Slowly the lion rose, and as he rose, a twig snapped beneath one&#10;of his great, padded paws. Like a shot from a rifle he charged upon&#10;the filly; but the snapped twig had been enough to startle the&#10;timorous quarry, so that they were in instant flight simultaneously&#10;with Numa&#39;s charge.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The stallion was last, and with a prodigious leap, the lion&#10;catapulted through the air to seize him; but the snapping twig had&#10;robbed Numa of his dinner, though his mighty talons raked the&#10;zebra&#39;s glossy rump, leaving four crimson bars across the beautiful&#10;coat.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was an angry Numa that quitted the river and prowled, fierce,&#10;dangerous, and hungry, into the jungle. Far from particular now was&#10;his appetite. Even Dango, the hyena, would have seemed a tidbit to&#10;that ravenous maw. And in this temper it was that the lion came&#10;upon the tribe of Kerchak, the great ape.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;One does not look for Numa, the lion, this late in the morning.&#10;He should be lying up asleep beside his last night&#39;s kill by now;&#10;but Numa had made no kill last night. He was still hunting,&#10;hungrier than ever.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The anthropoids were idling about the clearing, the first keen&#10;desire of the morning&#39;s hunger having been satisfied. Numa scented&#10;them long before he saw them. Ordinarily he would have turned away&#10;in search of other game, for even Numa respected the mighty muscles&#10;and the sharp fangs of the great bulls of the tribe of Kerchak, but&#10;today he kept on steadily toward them, his bristled snout wrinkled&#10;into a savage snarl.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Without an instant&#39;s hesitation, Numa charged the moment he&#10;reached a point from where the apes were visible to him. There were&#10;a dozen or more of the hairy, manlike creatures upon the ground in&#10;a little glade. In a tree at one side sat a brown-skinned youth. He&#10;saw Numa&#39;s swift charge; he saw the apes turn and flee, huge bulls&#10;trampling upon little balus; only a single she held her ground to&#10;meet the charge, a young she inspired by new motherhood to the&#10;great sacrifice that her balu might escape.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan leaped from his perch, screaming at the flying bulls&#10;beneath and at those who squatted in the safety of surrounding&#10;trees. Had the bulls stood their ground, Numa would not have&#10;carried through that charge unless goaded by great rage or the&#10;gnawing pangs of starvation. Even then he would not have come off&#10;unscathed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;If the bulls heard, they were too slow in responding, for Numa&#10;had seized the mother ape and dragged her into the jungle before&#10;the males had sufficiently collected their wits and their courage&#10;to rally in defense of their fellow. Tarzan&#39;s angry voice aroused&#10;similar anger in the breasts of the apes. Snarling and barking they&#10;followed Numa into the dense labyrinth of foliage wherein he sought&#10;to hide himself from them. The ape-man was in the lead, moving&#10;rapidly and yet with caution, depending even more upon his ears and&#10;nose than upon his eyes for information of the lion&#39;s&#10;whereabouts.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The spoor was easy to follow, for the dragged body of the victim&#10;left a plain trail, blood-spattered and scentful. Even such dull&#10;creatures as you or I might easily have followed it. To Tarzan and&#10;the apes of Kerchak it was as obvious as a cement sidewalk.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan knew that they were nearing the great cat even before he&#10;heard an angry growl of warning just ahead. Calling to the apes to&#10;follow his example, he swung into a tree and a moment later Numa&#10;was surrounded by a ring of growling beasts, well out of reach of&#10;his fangs and talons but within plain sight of him. The carnivore&#10;crouched with his fore-quarters upon the she-ape. Tarzan could see&#10;that the latter was already dead; but something within him made it&#10;seem quite necessary to rescue the useless body from the clutches&#10;of the enemy and to punish him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He shrieked taunts and insults at Numa, and tearing dead&#10;branches from the tree in which he danced, hurled them at the lion.&#10;The apes followed his example. Numa roared out in rage and&#10;vexation. He was hungry, but under such conditions he could not&#10;feed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The apes, if they had been left to themselves, would doubtless&#10;soon have left the lion to peaceful enjoyment of his feast, for was&#10;not the she dead? They could not restore her to life by throwing&#10;sticks at Numa, and they might even now be feeding in quiet&#10;themselves; but Tarzan was of a different mind. Numa must be&#10;punished and driven away. He must be taught that even though he&#10;killed a Mangani, he would not be permitted to feed upon his kill.&#10;The man-mind looked into the future, while the apes perceived only&#10;the immediate present. They would be content to escape today the&#10;menace of Numa, while Tarzan saw the necessity, and the means as&#10;well, of safeguarding the days to come.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So he urged the great anthropoids on until Numa was showered&#10;with missiles that kept his head dodging and his voice pealing&#10;forth its savage protest; but still he clung desperately to his&#10;kill.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The twigs and branches hurled at Numa, Tarzan soon realized, did&#10;not hurt him greatly even when they struck him, and did not injure&#10;him at all, so the ape-man looked about for more effective&#10;missiles, nor did he have to look long. An out-cropping of&#10;decomposed granite not far from Numa suggested ammunition of a much&#10;more painful nature. Calling to the apes to watch him, Tarzan&#10;slipped to the ground and gathered a handful of small fragments. He&#10;knew that when once they had seen him carry out his idea they would&#10;be much quicker to follow his lead than to obey his instructions,&#10;were he to command them to procure pieces of rock and hurl them at&#10;Numa, for Tarzan was not then king of the apes of the tribe of&#10;Kerchak. That came in later years. Now he was but a youth, though&#10;one who already had wrested for himself a place in the councils of&#10;the savage beasts among whom a strange fate had cast him. The&#10;sullen bulls of the older generation still hated him as beasts hate&#10;those of whom they are suspicious, whose scent characteristic is&#10;the scent characteristic of an alien order and, therefore, of an&#10;enemy order. The younger bulls, those who had grown up through&#10;childhood as his playmates, were as accustomed to Tarzan&#39;s scent as&#10;to that of any other member of the tribe. They felt no greater&#10;suspicion of him than of any other bull of their acquaintance; yet&#10;they did not love him, for they loved none outside the mating&#10;season, and the animosities aroused by other bulls during that&#10;season lasted well over until the next. They were a morose and&#10;peevish band at best, though here and there were those among them&#10;in whom germinated the primal seeds of humanity&#8212;reversions to type,&#10;these, doubtless; reversions to the ancient progenitor who took the&#10;first step out of ape-hood toward humanness, when he walked more&#10;often upon his hind feet and discovered other things for idle hands&#10;to do.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So now Tarzan led where he could not yet command. He had long&#10;since discovered the apish propensity for mimicry and learned to&#10;make use of it. Having filled his arms with fragments of rotted&#10;granite, he clambered again into a tree, and it pleased him to see&#10;that the apes had followed his example.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;During the brief respite while they were gathering their&#10;ammunition, Numa had settled himself to feed; but scarce had he&#10;arranged himself and his kill when a sharp piece of rock hurled by&#10;the practiced hand of the ape-man struck him upon the cheek. His&#10;sudden roar of pain and rage was smothered by a volley from the&#10;apes, who had seen Tarzan&#39;s act. Numa shook his massive head and&#10;glared upward at his tormentors. For a half hour they pursued him&#10;with rocks and broken branches, and though he dragged his kill into&#10;densest thickets, yet they always found a way to reach him with&#10;their missiles, giving him no opportunity to feed, and driving him&#10;on and on.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The hairless ape-thing with the man scent was worst of all, for&#10;he had even the temerity to advance upon the ground to within a few&#10;yards of the Lord of the Jungle, that he might with greater&#10;accuracy and force hurl the sharp bits of granite and the heavy&#10;sticks at him. Time and again did Numa charge&#8212;sudden, vicious&#10;charges&#8212;but the lithe, active tormentor always managed to elude him&#10;and with such insolent ease that the lion forgot even his great&#10;hunger in the consuming passion of his rage, leaving his meat for&#10;considerable spaces of time in vain efforts to catch his enemy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The apes and Tarzan pursued the great beast to a natural&#10;clearing, where Numa evidently determined to make a last stand,&#10;taking up his position in the center of the open space, which was&#10;far enough from any tree to render him practically immune from the&#10;rather erratic throwing of the apes, though Tarzan still found him&#10;with most persistent and aggravating frequency.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;This, however, did not suit the ape-man, since Numa now suffered&#10;an occasional missile with no more than a snarl, while he settled&#10;himself to partake of his delayed feast. Tarzan scratched his head,&#10;pondering some more effective method of offense, for he had&#10;determined to prevent Numa from profiting in any way through his&#10;attack upon the tribe. The man-mind reasoned against the future,&#10;while the shaggy apes thought only of their present hatred of this&#10;ancestral enemy. Tarzan guessed that should Numa find it an easy&#10;thing to snatch a meal from the tribe of Kerchak, it would be but a&#10;short time before their existence would be one living nightmare of&#10;hideous watchfulness and dread. Numa must be taught that the&#10;killing of an ape brought immediate punishment and no rewards. It&#10;would take but a few lessons to insure the former safety of the&#10;tribe. This must be some old lion whose failing strength and&#10;agility had forced him to any prey that he could catch; but even a&#10;single lion, undisputed, could exterminate the tribe, or at least&#10;make its existence so precarious and so terrifying that life would&#10;no longer be a pleasant condition.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Let him hunt among the Gomangani,&#34; thought Tarzan. &#34;He will&#10;find them easier prey. I will teach ferocious Numa that he may not&#10;hunt the Mangani.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But how to wrest the body of his victim from the feeding lion&#10;was the first question to be solved. At last Tarzan hit upon a&#10;plan. To anyone but Tarzan of the Apes it might have seemed rather&#10;a risky plan, and perhaps it did even to him; but Tarzan rather&#10;liked things that contained a considerable element of danger. At&#10;any rate, I rather doubt that you or I would have chosen a similar&#10;plan for foiling an angry and a hungry lion.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan required assistance in the scheme he had hit upon and his&#10;assistant must be equally as brave and almost as active as he. The&#10;ape-man&#39;s eyes fell upon Taug, the playmate of his childhood, the&#10;rival in his first love and now, of all the bulls of the tribe, the&#10;only one that might be thought to hold in his savage brain any such&#10;feeling toward Tarzan as we describe among ourselves as friendship.&#10;At least, Tarzan knew, Taug was courageous, and he was young and&#10;agile and wonderfully muscled.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Taug!&#34; cried the ape-man. The great ape looked up from a dead&#10;limb he was attempting to tear from a lightning-blasted tree. &#34;Go&#10;close to Numa and worry him,&#34; said Tarzan. &#34;Worry him until he&#10;charges. Lead him away from the body of Mamka. Keep him away as&#10;long as you can.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Taug nodded. He was across the clearing from Tarzan. Wresting&#10;the limb at last from the tree he dropped to the ground and&#10;advanced toward Numa, growling and barking out his insults. The&#10;worried lion looked up and rose to his feet. His tail went stiffly&#10;erect and Taug turned in flight, for he knew that warming signal of&#10;the charge.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;From behind the lion, Tarzan ran quickly toward the center of&#10;the clearing and the body of Mamka. Numa, all his eyes for Taug,&#10;did not see the ape-man. Instead he shot forward after the fleeing&#10;bull, who had turned in flight not an instant too soon, since he&#10;reached the nearest tree but a yard or two ahead of the pursuing&#10;demon. Like a cat the heavy anthropoid scampered up the bole of his&#10;sanctuary. Numa&#39;s talons missed him by little more than inches.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For a moment the lion paused beneath the tree, glaring up at the&#10;ape and roaring until the earth trembled, then he turned back again&#10;toward his kill, and as he did so, his tail shot once more to rigid&#10;erectness and he charged back even more ferociously than he had&#10;come, for what he saw was the naked man-thing running toward the&#10;farther trees with the bloody carcass of his prey across a giant&#10;shoulder.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The apes, watching the grim race from the safety of the trees,&#10;screamed taunts at Numa and warnings to Tarzan. The high sun, hot&#10;and brilliant, fell like a spotlight upon the actors in the little&#10;clearing, portraying them in glaring relief to the audience in the&#10;leafy shadows of the surrounding trees. The light-brown body of the&#10;naked youth, all but hidden by the shaggy carcass of the killed&#10;ape, the red blood streaking his smooth hide, his muscles rolling,&#10;velvety, beneath. Behind him the black-maned lion, head flattened,&#10;tail extended, racing, a jungle thoroughbred, across the sunlit&#10;clearing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Ah, but this was life! With death at his heels, Tarzan thrilled&#10;with the joy of such living as this; but would he reach the trees&#10;ahead of the rampant death so close behind?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Gunto swung from a limb in a tree before him. Gunto was&#10;screaming warnings and advice.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Catch me!&#34; cried Tarzan, and with his heavy burden leaped&#10;straight for the big bull hanging there by his hind feet and one&#10;forepaw. And Gunto caught them&#8212;the big ape-man and the dead weight&#10;of the slain she-ape&#8212;caught them with one great, hairy paw and&#10;whirled them upward until Tarzan&#39;s fingers closed upon a near-by&#10;branch.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Beneath, Numa leaped; but Gunto, heavy and awkward as he may&#10;have appeared, was as quick as Manu, the monkey, so that the lion&#39;s&#10;talons but barely grazed him, scratching a bloody streak beneath&#10;one hairy arm.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan carried Mamka&#39;s corpse to a high crotch, where even&#10;Sheeta, the panther, could not get it. Numa paced angrily back and&#10;forth beneath the tree, roaring frightfully. He had been robbed of&#10;his kill and his revenge also. He was very savage indeed; but his&#10;despoilers were well out of his reach, and after hurling a few&#10;taunts and missiles at him they swung away through the trees,&#10;fiercely reviling him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan thought much upon the little adventure of that day. He&#10;foresaw what might happen should the great carnivora of the jungle&#10;turn their serious attention upon the tribe of Kerchak, the great&#10;ape, but equally he thought upon the wild scramble of the apes for&#10;safety when Numa first charged among them. There is little humor in&#10;the jungle that is not grim and awful. The beasts have little or no&#10;conception of humor; but the young Englishman saw humor in many&#10;things which presented no humorous angle to his associates.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Since earliest childhood he had been a searcher after fun, much&#10;to the sorrow of his fellow-apes, and now he saw the humor of the&#10;frightened panic of the apes and the baffled rage of Numa even in&#10;this grim jungle adventure which had robbed Mamka of life, and&#10;jeopardized that of many members of the tribe.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was but a few weeks later that Sheeta, the panther, made a&#10;sudden rush among the tribe and snatched a little balu from a tree&#10;where it had been hidden while its mother sought food. Sheeta got&#10;away with his small prize unmolested. Tarzan was very wroth. He&#10;spoke to the bulls of the ease with which Numa and Sheeta, in a&#10;single moon, had slain two members of the tribe.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;They will take us all for food,&#34; he cried. &#34;We hunt as we will&#10;through the jungle, paying no heed to approaching enemies. Even&#10;Manu, the monkey, does not so. He keeps two or three always&#10;watching for enemies. Pacco, the zebra, and Wappi, the antelope,&#10;have those about the herd who keep watch while the others feed,&#10;while we, the great Mangani, let Numa, and Sabor, and Sheeta come&#10;when they will and carry us off to feed their balus.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Gr-r-rmph,&#34; said Numgo.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What are we to do?&#34; asked Taug.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;We, too, should have two or three always watching for the&#10;approach of Numa, and Sabor, and Sheeta,&#34; replied Tarzan. &#34;No&#10;others need we fear, except Histah, the snake, and if we watch for&#10;the others we will see Histah if he comes, though gliding ever so&#10;silently.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And so it was that the great apes of the tribe of Kerchak posted&#10;sentries thereafter, who watched upon three sides while the tribe&#10;hunted, scattered less than had been their wont.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But Tarzan went abroad alone, for Tarzan was a man-thing and&#10;sought amusement and adventure and such humor as the grim and&#10;terrible jungle offers to those who know it and do not fear it&#8212;a&#10;weird humor shot with blazing eyes and dappled with the crimson of&#10;lifeblood. While others sought only food and love, Tarzan of the&#10;Apes sought food and joy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;One day he hovered above the palisaded village of Mbonga, the&#10;chief, the jet cannibal of the jungle primeval. He saw, as he had&#10;seen many times before, the witch-doctor, Rabba Kega, decked out in&#10;the head and hide of Gorgo, the buffalo. It amused Tarzan to see a&#10;Gomangani parading as Gorgo; but it suggested nothing in particular&#10;to him until he chanced to see stretched against the side of&#10;Mbonga&#39;s hut the skin of a lion with the head still on. Then a&#10;broad grin widened the handsome face of the savage beast-youth.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Back into the jungle he went until chance, agility, strength,&#10;and cunning backed by his marvelous powers of perception, gave him&#10;an easy meal. If Tarzan felt that the world owed him a living he&#10;also realized that it was for him to collect it, nor was there ever&#10;a better collector than this son of an English lord, who knew even&#10;less of the ways of his forbears than he did of the forbears&#10;themselves, which was nothing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was quite dark when Tarzan returned to the village of Mbonga&#10;and took his now polished perch in the tree which overhangs the&#10;palisade upon one side of the walled enclosure. As there was&#10;nothing in particular to feast upon in the village there was little&#10;life in the single street, for only an orgy of flesh and native&#10;beer could draw out the people of Mbonga. Tonight they sat&#10;gossiping about their cooking fires, the older members of the&#10;tribe; or, if they were young, paired off in the shadows cast by&#10;the palm-thatched huts.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan dropped lightly into the village, and sneaking stealthily&#10;in the concealment of the denser shadows, approached the hut of the&#10;chief, Mbonga. Here he found that which he sought. There were&#10;warriors all about him; but they did not know that the feared&#10;devil-god slunk noiselessly so near them, nor did they see him&#10;possess himself of that which he coveted and depart from their&#10;village as noiselessly as he had come.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Later that night, as Tarzan curled himself for sleep, he lay for&#10;a long time looking up at the burning planets and the twinkling&#10;stars and at Goro the moon, and he smiled. He recalled how&#10;ludicrous the great bulls had appeared in their mad scramble for&#10;safety that day when Numa had charged among them and seized Mamka,&#10;and yet he knew them to be fierce and courageous. It was the sudden&#10;shock of surprise that always sent them into a panic; but of this&#10;Tarzan was not as yet fully aware. That was something he was to&#10;learn in the near future.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He fell asleep with a broad grin upon his face.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Manu, the monkey, awoke him in the morning by dropping discarded&#10;bean pods upon his upturned face from a branch a short distance&#10;above him. Tarzan looked up and smiled. He had been awakened thus&#10;before many times. He and Manu were fairly good friends, their&#10;friendship operating upon a reciprocal basis. Sometimes Manu would&#10;come running early in the morning to awaken Tarzan and tell him&#10;that Bara, the deer, was feeding close at hand, or that Horta, the&#10;boar, was asleep in a mudhole hard by, and in return Tarzan broke&#10;open the shells of the harder nuts and fruits for Manu, or&#10;frightened away Histah, the snake, and Sheeta, the panther.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The sun had been up for some time, and the tribe had already&#10;wandered off in search of food. Manu indicated the direction they&#10;had taken with a wave of his hand and a few piping notes of his&#10;squeaky little voice.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Come, Manu,&#34; said Tarzan, &#34;and you will see that which shall&#10;make you dance for joy and squeal your wrinkled little head off.&#10;Come, follow Tarzan of the Apes.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With that he set off in the direction Manu had indicated and&#10;above him, chattering, scolding and squealing, skipped Manu, the&#10;monkey. Across Tarzan&#39;s shoulders was the thing he had stolen from&#10;the village of Mbonga, the chief, the evening before.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The tribe was feeding in the forest beside the clearing where&#10;Gunto, and Taug, and Tarzan had so harassed Numa and finally taken&#10;away from him the fruit of his kill. Some of them were in the&#10;clearing itself. In peace and content they fed, for were there not&#10;three sentries, each watching upon a different side of the herd?&#10;Tarzan had taught them this, and though he had been away for&#10;several days hunting alone, as he often did, or visiting at the&#10;cabin by the sea, they had not as yet forgotten his admonitions,&#10;and if they continued for a short time longer to post sentries, it&#10;would become a habit of their tribal life and thus be perpetuated&#10;indefinitely.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But Tarzan, who knew them better than they knew themselves, was&#10;confident that they had ceased to place the watchers about them the&#10;moment that he had left them, and now he planned not only to have a&#10;little fun at their expense but to teach them a lesson in&#10;preparedness, which, by the way, is even a more vital issue in the&#10;jungle than in civilized places. That you and I exist today must be&#10;due to the preparedness of some shaggy anthropoid of the Oligocene.&#10;Of course the apes of Kerchak were always prepared, after their own&#10;way&#8212;Tarzan had merely suggested a new and additional safeguard.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Gunto was posted today to the north of the clearing. He squatted&#10;in the fork of a tree from where he might view the jungle for quite&#10;a distance about him. It was he who first discovered the enemy. A&#10;rustling in the undergrowth attracted his attention, and a moment&#10;later he had a partial view of a shaggy mane and tawny yellow back.&#10;Just a glimpse it was through the matted foliage beneath him; but&#10;it brought from Gunto&#39;s leathern lungs a shrill &#34;Kreeg-ah!&#34; which&#10;is the ape for beware, or danger.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Instantly the tribe took up the cry until &#34;Kreeg-ahs!&#34; rang&#10;through the jungle about the clearing as apes swung quickly to&#10;places of safety among the lower branches of the trees and the&#10;great bulls hastened in the direction of Gunto.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And then into the clearing strode Numa, the lion&#8212; majestic and&#10;mighty, and from a deep chest issued the moan and the cough and the&#10;rumbling roar that set stiff hairs to bristling from shaggy&#10;craniums down the length of mighty spines.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Inside the clearing, Numa paused and on the instant there fell&#10;upon him from the trees near by a shower of broken rock and dead&#10;limbs torn from age-old trees. A dozen times he was hit, and then&#10;the apes ran down and gathered other rocks, pelting him&#10;unmercifully.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Numa turned to flee, but his way was barred by a fusilade of&#10;sharp-cornered missiles, and then, upon the edge of the clearing,&#10;great Taug met him with a huge fragment of rock as large as a man&#39;s&#10;head, and down went the Lord of the Jungle beneath the stunning&#10;blow.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With shrieks and roars and loud barkings the great apes of the&#10;tribe of Kerchak rushed upon the fallen lion. Sticks and stones and&#10;yellow fangs menaced the still form. In another moment, before he&#10;could regain consciousness, Numa would be battered and torn until&#10;only a bloody mass of broken bones and matted hair remained of what&#10;had once been the most dreaded of jungle creatures.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But even as the sticks and stones were raised above him and the&#10;great fangs bared to tear him, there descended like a plummet from&#10;the trees above a diminutive figure with long, white whiskers and a&#10;wrinkled face. Square upon the body of Numa it alighted and there&#10;it danced and screamed and shrieked out its challenge against the&#10;bulls of Kerchak.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For an instant they paused, paralyzed by the wonder of the&#10;thing. It was Manu, the monkey, Manu, the little coward, and here&#10;he was daring the ferocity of the great Mangani, hopping about upon&#10;the carcass of Numa, the lion, and crying out that they must not&#10;strike it again.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And when the bulls paused, Manu reached down and seized a tawny&#10;ear. With all his little might he tugged upon the heavy head until&#10;slowly it turned back, revealing the tousled, black head and&#10;clean-cut profile of Tarzan of the Apes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Some of the older apes were for finishing what they had&#10;commenced; but Taug, sullen, mighty Taug, sprang quickly to the&#10;ape-man&#39;s side and straddling the unconscious form warned back&#10;those who would have struck his childhood playmate. And Teeka, his&#10;mate, came too, taking her place with bared fangs at Taug&#39;s side.&#10;others followed their example, until at last Tarzan was surrounded&#10;by a ring of hairy champions who would permit no enemy to approach&#10;him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was a surprised and chastened Tarzan who opened his eyes to&#10;consciousness a few minutes later. He looked about him at the&#10;surrounding apes and slowly there returned to him a realization of&#10;what had occurred.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Gradually a broad grin illuminated his features. His bruises&#10;were many and they hurt; but the good that had come from his&#10;adventure was worth all that it had cost. He had learned, for&#10;instance, that the apes of Kerchak had heeded his teaching, and he&#10;had learned that he had good friends among the sullen beasts whom&#10;he had thought without sentiment. He had discovered that Manu, the&#10;monkey&#8212;even little, cowardly Manu&#8212;had risked his life in his&#10;defense.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It made Tarzan very glad to know these things; but at the other&#10;lesson he had been taught he reddened. He had always been a joker,&#10;the only joker in the grim and terrible company; but now as he lay&#10;there half dead from his hurts, he almost swore a solemn oath&#10;forever to forego practical joking&#8212;almost; but not quite.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 15, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/943')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Nightmare'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;THE BLACKS OF the village of Mbonga, the chief, were feasting,&#10;while above them in a large tree sat Tarzan of the Apes&#8212;grim,&#10;terrible, empty, and envious. Hunting had proved poor that day, for&#10;there are lean days as well as fat ones for even the greatest of&#10;the jungle hunters. Oftentimes Tarzan went empty for more than a&#10;full sun, and he had passed through entire moons during which he&#10;had been but barely able to stave off starvation; but such times&#10;were infrequent.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There once had been a period of sickness among the grass-eaters&#10;which had left the plains almost bare of game for several years,&#10;and again the great cats had increased so rapidly and so overrun&#10;the country that their prey, which was also Tarzan&#39;s, had been&#10;frightened off for a considerable time.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But for the most part Tarzan had fed well always. Today, though,&#10;he had gone empty, one misfortune following another as rapidly as&#10;he raised new quarry, so that now, as he sat perched in the tree&#10;above the feasting blacks, he experienced all the pangs of famine&#10;and his hatred for his lifelong enemies waxed strong in his breast.&#10;It was tantalizing, indeed, to sit there hungry while these&#10;Gomangani filled themselves so full of food that their stomachs&#10;seemed almost upon the point of bursting, and with elephant steaks&#10;at that!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was true that Tarzan and Tantor were the best of friends, and&#10;that Tarzan never yet had tasted of the flesh of the elephant; but&#10;the Gomangani evidently had slain one, and as they were eating of&#10;the flesh of their kill, Tarzan was assailed by no doubts as to the&#10;ethics of his doing likewise, should he have the opportunity. Had&#10;he known that the elephant had died of sickness several days before&#10;the blacks discovered the carcass, he might not have been so keen&#10;to partake of the feast, for Tarzan of the Apes was no&#10;carrion-eater. Hunger, however, may blunt the most epicurean taste,&#10;and Tarzan was not exactly an epicure.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;What he was at this moment was a very hungry wild beast whom&#10;caution was holding in leash, for the great cooking pot in the&#10;center of the village was surrounded by black warriors, through&#10;whom not even Tarzan of the Apes might hope to pass unharmed. It&#10;would be necessary, therefore, for the watcher to remain there&#10;hungry until the blacks had gorged themselves to stupor, and then,&#10;if they had left any scraps, to make the best meal he could from&#10;such; but to the impatient Tarzan it seemed that the greedy&#10;Gomangani would rather burst than leave the feast before the last&#10;morsel had been devoured. For a time they broke the monotony of&#10;eating by executing portions of a hunting dance, a maneuver which&#10;sufficiently stimulated digestion to permit them to fall to once&#10;more with renewed vigor; but with the consumption of appalling&#10;quantities of elephant meat and native beer they presently became&#10;too loggy for physical exertion of any sort, some reaching a stage&#10;where they no longer could rise from the ground, but lay&#10;conveniently close to the great cooking pot, stuffing themselves&#10;into unconsciousness.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was well past midnight before Tarzan even could begin to see&#10;the end of the orgy. The blacks were now falling asleep rapidly;&#10;but a few still persisted. From before their condition Tarzan had&#10;no doubt but that he easily could enter the village and snatch a&#10;handful of meat from before their noses; but a handful was not what&#10;he wanted. Nothing less than a stomachful would allay the gnawing&#10;craving of that great emptiness. He must therefore have ample time&#10;to forage in peace.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At last but a single warrior remained true to his ideals&#8212; an old&#10;fellow whose once wrinkled belly was now as smooth and as tight as&#10;the head of a drum. With evidences of great discomfort, and even&#10;pain, he would crawl toward the pot and drag himself slowly to his&#10;knees, from which position he could reach into the receptacle and&#10;seize a piece of meat. Then he would roll over on his back with a&#10;loud groan and lie there while he slowly forced the food between&#10;his teeth and down into his gorged stomach.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was evident to Tarzan that the old fellow would eat until he&#10;died, or until there was no more meat. The ape-man shook his head&#10;in disgust. What foul creatures were these Gomangani? Yet of all&#10;the jungle folk they alone resembled Tarzan closely in form. Tarzan&#10;was a man, and they, too, must be some manner of men, just as the&#10;little monkeys, and the great apes, and Bolgani, the gorilla, were&#10;quite evidently of one great family, though differing in size and&#10;appearance and customs. Tarzan was ashamed, for of all the beasts&#10;of the jungle, then, man was the most disgusting&#8212;man and Dango, the&#10;hyena. Only man and Dango ate until they swelled up like a dead&#10;rat. Tarzan had seen Dango eat his way into the carcass of a dead&#10;elephant and then continue to eat so much that he had been unable&#10;to get out of the hole through which he had entered. Now he could&#10;readily believe that man, given the opportunity, would do the same.&#10;Man, too, was the most unlovely of creatures&#8212;with his skinny legs&#10;and his big stomach, his filed teeth, and his thick, red lips. Man&#10;was disgusting. Tarzan&#39;s gaze was riveted upon the hideous old&#10;warrior wallowing in filth beneath him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There! the thing was struggling to its knees to reach for&#10;another morsel of flesh. It groaned aloud in pain and yet it&#10;persisted in eating, eating, ever eating. Tarzan could endure it no&#10;longer&#8212;neither his hunger nor his disgust. Silently he slipped to&#10;the ground with the bole of the great tree between himself and the&#10;feaster.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The man was still kneeling, bent almost double in agony, before&#10;the cooking pot. His back was toward the ape-man. Swiftly and&#10;noiselessly Tarzan approached him. There was no sound as steel&#10;fingers closed about the black throat. The struggle was short, for&#10;the man was old and already half stupefied from the effects of the&#10;gorging and the beer.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan dropped the inert mass and scooped several large pieces&#10;of meat from the cooking pot&#8212;enough to satisfy even his great&#10;hunger&#8212;then he raised the body of the feaster and shoved it into&#10;the vessel. When the other blacks awoke they would have something&#10;to think about! Tarzan grinned. As he turned toward the tree with&#10;his meat, he picked up a vessel containing beer and raised it to&#10;his lips, but at the first taste he spat the stuff from his mouth&#10;and tossed the primitive tankard aside. He was quite sure that even&#10;Dango would draw the line at such filthy tasting drink as that, and&#10;his contempt for man increased with the conviction.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan swung off into the jungle some half mile or so before he&#10;paused to partake of his stolen food. He noticed that it gave forth&#10;a strange and unpleasant odor, but assumed that this was due to the&#10;fact that it had stood in a vessel of water above a fire. Tarzan&#10;was, of course, unaccustomed to cooked food. He did not like it;&#10;but he was very hungry and had eaten a considerable portion of his&#10;haul before it was really borne in upon him that the stuff was&#10;nauseating. It required far less than he had imagined it would to&#10;satisfy his appetite.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Throwing the balance to the ground he curled up in a convenient&#10;crotch and sought slumber; but slumber seemed difficult to woo.&#10;Ordinarily Tarzan of the Apes was asleep as quickly as a dog after&#10;it curls itself upon a hearthrug before a roaring blaze; but&#10;tonight he squirmed and twisted, for at the pit of his stomach was&#10;a peculiar feeling that resembled nothing more closely than an&#10;attempt upon the part of the fragments of elephant meat reposing&#10;there to come out into the night and search for their elephant; but&#10;Tarzan was adamant. He gritted his teeth and held them back. He was&#10;not to be robbed of his meal after waiting so long to obtain&#10;it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He had succeeded in dozing when the roaring of a lion awoke him.&#10;He sat up to discover that it was broad daylight. Tarzan rubbed his&#10;eyes. Could it be that he had really slept? He did not feel&#10;particularly refreshed as he should have after a good sleep. A&#10;noise attracted his attention, and he looked down to see a lion&#10;standing at the foot of the tree gazing hungrily at him. Tarzan&#10;made a face at the king of beasts, whereat Numa, greatly to the&#10;ape-man&#39;s surprise, started to climb up into the branches toward&#10;him. Now, never before had Tarzan seen a lion climb a tree, yet,&#10;for some unaccountable reason, he was not greatly surprised that&#10;this particular lion should do so.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As the lion climbed slowly toward him, Tarzan sought higher&#10;branches; but to his chagrin, he discovered that it was with the&#10;utmost difficulty that he could climb at all. Again and again he&#10;slipped back, losing all that he had gained, while the lion kept&#10;steadily at his climbing, coming ever closer and closer to the&#10;ape-man. Tarzan could see the hungry light in the yellow-green&#10;eyes. He could see the slaver on the drooping jowls, and the great&#10;fangs agape to seize and destroy him. Clawing desperately, the&#10;ape-man at last succeeded in gaining a little upon his pursuer. He&#10;reached the more slender branches far aloft where he well knew no&#10;lion could follow; yet on and on came devil-faced Numa. It was&#10;incredible; but it was true. Yet what most amazed Tarzan was that&#10;though he realized the incredibility of it all, he at the same time&#10;accepted it as a matter of course, first that a lion should climb&#10;at all and second that he should enter the upper terraces where&#10;even Sheeta, the panther, dared not venture.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;To the very top of a tall tree the ape-man clawed his awkward&#10;way and after him came Numa, the lion, moaning dismally. At last&#10;Tarzan stood balanced upon the very utmost pinnacle of a swaying&#10;branch, high above the forest. He could go no farther. Below him&#10;the lion came steadily upward, and Tarzan of the Apes realized that&#10;at last the end had come. He could not do battle upon a tiny branch&#10;with Numa, the lion, especially with such a Numa, to which swaying&#10;branches two hundred feet above the ground provided as substantial&#10;footing as the ground itself.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Nearer and nearer came the lion. Another moment and he could&#10;reach up with one great paw and drag the ape-man downward to those&#10;awful jaws. A whirring noise above his head caused Tarzan to glance&#10;apprehensively upward. A great bird was circling close above him.&#10;He never had seen so large a bird in all his life, yet he&#10;recognized it immediately, for had he not seen it hundreds of times&#10;in one of the books in the little cabin by the land-locked bay&#8212;the&#10;moss-grown cabin that with its contents was the sole heritage left&#10;by his dead and unknown father to the young Lord Greystoke?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In the picture-book the great bird was shown flying far above&#10;the ground with a small child in its talons while, beneath, a&#10;distracted mother stood with uplifted hands. The lion was already&#10;reaching forth a taloned paw to seize him when the bird swooped and&#10;buried no less formidable talons in Tarzan&#39;s back. The pain was&#10;numbing; but it was with a sense of relief that the ape-man felt&#10;himself snatched from the clutches of Numa.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With a great whirring of wings the bird rose rapidly until the&#10;forest lay far below. It made Tarzan sick and dizzy to look down&#10;upon it from so great a height, so he closed his eyes tight and&#10;held his breath. Higher and higher climbed the huge bird. Tarzan&#10;opened his eyes. The jungle was so far away that he could see only&#10;a dim, green blur below him, but just above and quite close was the&#10;sun. Tarzan reached out his hands and warmed them, for they were&#10;very cold. Then a sudden madness seized him. Where was the bird&#10;taking him? Was he to submit thus passively to a feathered creature&#10;however enormous? Was he, Tarzan of the Apes, mighty fighter, to&#10;die without striking a blow in his own defense? Never!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He snatched the hunting blade from his gee-string and thrusting&#10;upward drove it once, twice, thrice into the breast above him. The&#10;mighty wings fluttered a few more times, spasmodically, the talons&#10;relaxed their hold, and Tarzan of the Apes fell hurtling downward&#10;toward the distant jungle.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It seemed to the ape-man that he fell for many minutes before he&#10;crashed through the leafy verdure of the tree tops. The smaller&#10;branches broke his fall, so that he came to rest for an instant&#10;upon the very branch upon which he had sought slumber the previous&#10;night. For an instant he toppled there in a frantic attempt to&#10;regain his equilibrium; but at last he rolled off, yet, clutching&#10;wildly, he succeeded in grasping the branch and hanging on.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Once more he opened his eyes, which he had closed during the&#10;fall. Again it was night. With all his old agility he clambered&#10;back to the crotch from which he had toppled. Below him a lion&#10;roared, and, looking downward, Tarzan could see the yellow-green&#10;eyes shining in the moonlight as they bored hungrily upward through&#10;the darkness of the jungle night toward him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The ape-man gasped for breath. Cold sweat stood out from every&#10;pore, there was a great sickness at the pit of Tarzan&#39;s stomach.&#10;Tarzan of the Apes had dreamed his first dream.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For a long time he sat watching for Numa to climb into the tree&#10;after him, and listening for the sound of the great wings from&#10;above, for to Tarzan of the Apes his dream was a reality.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He could not believe what he had seen and yet, having seen even&#10;these incredible things, he could not disbelieve the evidence of&#10;his own perceptions. Never in all his life had Tarzan&#39;s senses&#10;deceived him badly, and so, naturally, he had great faith in them.&#10;Each perception which ever had been transmitted to Tarzan&#39;s brain&#10;had been, with varying accuracy, a true perception. He could not&#10;conceive of the possibility of apparently having passed through&#10;such a weird adventure in which there was no grain of truth. That a&#10;stomach, disordered by decayed elephant flesh, a lion roaring in&#10;the jungle, a picture-book, and sleep could have so truly portrayed&#10;all the clear-cut details of what he had seemingly experienced was&#10;quite beyond his knowledge; yet he knew that Numa could not climb a&#10;tree, he knew that there existed in the jungle no such bird as he&#10;had seen, and he knew, too, that he could not have fallen a tiny&#10;fraction of the distance he had hurtled downward, and lived.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;To say the least, he was a very puzzled Tarzan as he tried to&#10;compose himself once more for slumber&#8212;a very puzzled and a very&#10;nauseated Tarzan.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As he thought deeply upon the strange occurrences of the night,&#10;he witnessed another remarkable happening. It was indeed quite&#10;preposterous, yet he saw it all with his own eyes&#8212;it was nothing&#10;less than Histah, the snake, wreathing his sinuous and slimy way up&#10;the bole of the tree below him&#8212;Histah, with the head of the old man&#10;Tarzan had shoved into the cooking pot&#8212;the head and the round,&#10;tight, black, distended stomach. As the old man&#39;s frightful face,&#10;with upturned eyes, set and glassy, came close to Tarzan, the jaws&#10;opened to seize him. The ape-man struck furiously at the hideous&#10;face, and as he struck the apparition disappeared.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan sat straight up upon his branch trembling in every limb,&#10;wide-eyed and panting. He looked all around him with his keen,&#10;jungle-trained eyes, but he saw naught of the old man with the body&#10;of Histah, the snake, but on his naked thigh the ape-man saw a&#10;caterpillar, dropped from a branch above him. With a grimace he&#10;flicked it off into the darkness beneath.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And so the night wore on, dream following dream, nightmare&#10;following nightmare, until the distracted ape-man started like a&#10;frightened deer at the rustling of the wind in the trees about him,&#10;or leaped to his feet as the uncanny laugh of a hyena burst&#10;suddenly upon a momentary jungle silence. But at last the tardy&#10;morning broke and a sick and feverish Tarzan wound sluggishly&#10;through the dank and gloomy mazes of the forest in search of water.&#10;His whole body seemed on fire, a great sickness surged upward to&#10;his throat. He saw a tangle of almost impenetrable thicket, and,&#10;like the wild beast he was, he crawled into it to die alone and&#10;unseen, safe from the attacks of predatory carnivora.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But he did not die. For a long time he wanted to; but presently&#10;nature and an outraged stomach relieved themselves in their own&#10;therapeutic manner, the ape-man broke into a violent perspiration&#10;and then fell into a normal and untroubled sleep which persisted&#10;well into the afternoon. When he awoke he found himself weak but no&#10;longer sick.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Once more he sought water, and after drinking deeply, took his&#10;way slowly toward the cabin by the sea. In times of loneliness and&#10;trouble it had long been his custom to seek there the quiet and&#10;restfulness which he could find nowhere else.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As he approached the cabin and raised the crude latch which his&#10;father had fashioned so many years before, two small, blood-shot&#10;eyes watched him from the concealing foliage of the jungle close&#10;by. From beneath shaggy, beetling brows they glared maliciously&#10;upon him, maliciously and with a keen curiosity; then Tarzan&#10;entered the cabin and closed the door after him. Here, with all the&#10;world shut out from him, he could dream without fear of&#10;interruption. He could curl up and look at the pictures in the&#10;strange things which were books, he could puzzle out the printed&#10;word he had learned to read without knowledge of the spoken&#10;language it represented, he could live in a wonderful world of&#10;which he had no knowledge beyond the covers of his beloved books.&#10;Numa and Sabor might prowl about close to him, the elements might&#10;rage in all their fury; but here at least, Tarzan might be entirely&#10;off his guard in a delightful relaxation which gave him all his&#10;faculties for the uninterrupted pursuit of this greatest of all his&#10;pleasures.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Today he turned to the picture of the huge bird which bore off&#10;the little Tarmangani in its talons. Tarzan puckered his brows as&#10;he examined the colored print. Yes, this was the very bird that had&#10;carried him off the day before, for to Tarzan the dream had been so&#10;great a reality that he still thought another day and a night had&#10;passed since he had lain down in the tree to sleep.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But the more he thought upon the matter the less positive he was&#10;as to the verity of the seeming adventure through which he had&#10;passed, yet where the real had ceased and the unreal commenced he&#10;was quite unable to determine. Had he really then been to the&#10;village of the blacks at all, had he killed the old Gomangani, had&#10;he eaten of the elephant meat, had he been sick? Tarzan scratched&#10;his tousled black head and wondered. It was all very strange, yet&#10;he knew that he never had seen Numa climb a tree, or Histah with&#10;the head and belly of an old black man whom Tarzan already had&#10;slain.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Finally, with a sigh he gave up trying to fathom the&#10;unfathomable, yet in his heart of hearts he knew that something had&#10;come into his life that he never before had experienced, another&#10;life which existed when he slept and the consciousness of which was&#10;carried over into his waking hours.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then he commenced to wonder if some of these strange creatures&#10;which he met in his sleep might not slay him, for at such times&#10;Tarzan of the Apes seemed to be a different Tarzan, sluggish,&#10;helpless and timid&#8212;wishing to flee his enemies as fled Bara, the&#10;deer, most fearful of creatures.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Thus, with a dream, came the first faint tinge of a knowledge of&#10;fear, a knowledge which Tarzan, awake, had never experienced, and&#10;perhaps he was experiencing what his early forbears passed through&#10;and transmitted to posterity in the form of superstition first and&#10;religion later; for they, as Tarzan, had seen things at night which&#10;they could not explain by the daylight standards of sense&#10;perception or of reason, and so had built for themselves a weird&#10;explanation which included grotesque shapes, possessed of strange&#10;and uncanny powers, to whom they finally came to attribute all&#10;those inexplicable phenomena of nature which with each recurrence&#10;filled them with awe, with wonder, or with terror.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And as Tarzan concentrated his mind on the little bugs upon the&#10;printed page before him, the active recollection of the strange&#10;adventures presently merged into the text of that which he was&#10;reading&#8212;a story of Bolgani, the gorilla, in captivity. There was a&#10;more or less lifelike illustration of Bolgani in colors and in a&#10;cage, with many remarkable looking Tarmangani standing against a&#10;rail and peering curiously at the snarling brute. Tarzan wondered&#10;not a little, as he always did, at the odd and seemingly useless&#10;array of colored plumage which covered the bodies of the&#10;Tarmangani. It always caused him to grin a trifle when he looked at&#10;these strange creatures. He wondered if they so covered their&#10;bodies from shame of their hairlessness or because they thought the&#10;odd things they wore added any to the beauty of their appearance.&#10;Particularly was Tarzan amused by the grotesque headdresses of the&#10;pictured people. He wondered how some of the shes succeeded in&#10;balancing theirs in an upright position, and he came as near to&#10;laughing aloud as he ever had, as he contemplated the funny little&#10;round things upon the heads of the hes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Slowly the ape-man picked out the meaning of the various&#10;combinations of letters on the printed page, and as he read, the&#10;little bugs, for as such he always thought of the letters,&#10;commenced to run about in a most confusing manner, blurring his&#10;vision and befuddling his thoughts. Twice he brushed the back of a&#10;hand smartly across his eyes; but only for a moment could he bring&#10;the bugs back to coherent and intelligible form. He had slept ill&#10;the night before and now he was exhausted from loss of sleep, from&#10;sickness, and from the slight fever he had had, so that it became&#10;more and more difficult to fix his attention, or to keep his eyes&#10;open.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan realized that he was falling asleep, and just as the&#10;realization was borne in upon him and he had decided to relinquish&#10;himself to an inclination which had assumed almost the proportions&#10;of a physical pain, he was aroused by the opening of the cabin&#10;door. Turning quickly toward the interruption Tarzan was amazed,&#10;for a moment, to see bulking large in the doorway the huge and&#10;hairy form of Bolgani, the gorilla.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now there was scarcely a denizen of the great jungle with whom&#10;Tarzan would rather not have been cooped up inside the small cabin&#10;than Bolgani, the gorilla, yet he felt no fear, even though his&#10;quick eye noted that Bolgani was in the throes of that jungle&#10;madness which seizes upon so many of the fiercer males. Ordinarily&#10;the huge gorillas avoid conflict, hide themselves from the other&#10;jungle folk, and are generally the best of neighbors; but when they&#10;are attacked, or the madness seizes them, there is no jungle&#10;denizen so bold and fierce as to deliberately seek a quarrel with&#10;them.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But for Tarzan there was no escape. Bolgani was glowering at him&#10;from red-rimmed, wicked eyes. In a moment he would rush in and&#10;seize the ape-man. Tarzan reached for the hunting knife where he&#10;had lain it on the table beside him; but as his fingers did not&#10;immediately locate the weapon, he turned a quick glance in search&#10;of it. As he did so his eyes fell upon the book he had been looking&#10;at which still lay open at the picture of Bolgani. Tarzan found his&#10;knife, but he merely fingered it idly and grinned in the direction&#10;of the advancing gorilla.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Not again would he be fooled by empty things which came while he&#10;slept! In a moment, no doubt, Bolgani would turn into Pamba, the&#10;rat, with the head of Tantor, the elephant. Tarzan had seen enough&#10;of such strange happenings recently to have some idea as to what he&#10;might expect; but this time Bolgani did not alter his form as he&#10;came slowly toward the young ape-man.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan was a bit puzzled, too, that he felt no desire to rush&#10;frantically to some place of safety, as had been the sensation most&#10;conspicuous in the other of his new and remarkable adventures. He&#10;was just himself now, ready to fight, if necessary; but still sure&#10;that no flesh and blood gorilla stood before him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The thing should be fading away into thin air by now, thought&#10;Tarzan, or changing into something else; yet it did not. Instead it&#10;loomed clear-cut and real as Bolgani himself, the magnificent dark&#10;coat glistening with life and health in a bar of sunlight which&#10;shot across the cabin through the high window behind the young Lord&#10;Greystoke. This was quite the most realistic of his sleep&#10;adventures, thought Tarzan, as he passively awaited the next&#10;amusing incident.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And then the gorilla charged. Two mighty, calloused hands seized&#10;upon the ape-man, great fangs were bared close to his face, a&#10;hideous growl burst from the cavernous throat and hot breath fanned&#10;Tarzan&#39;s cheek, and still he sat grinning at the apparition. Tarzan&#10;might be fooled once or twice, but not for so many times in&#10;succession! He knew that this Bolgani was no real Bolgani, for had&#10;he been he never could have gained entrance to the cabin, since&#10;only Tarzan knew how to operate the latch.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The gorilla seemed puzzled by the strange passivity of the&#10;hairless ape. He paused an instant with his jaws snarling close to&#10;the other&#39;s throat, then he seemed suddenly to come to some&#10;decision. Whirling the ape-man across a hairy shoulder, as easily&#10;as you or I might lift a babe in arms, Bolgani turned and dashed&#10;out into the open, racing toward the great trees.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now, indeed, was Tarzan sure that this was a sleep adventure,&#10;and so grinned largely as the giant gorilla bore him, unresisting,&#10;away. Presently, reasoned Tarzan, he would awaken and find himself&#10;back in the cabin where he had fallen asleep. He glanced back at&#10;the thought and saw the cabin door standing wide open. This would&#10;never do! Always had he been careful to close and latch it against&#10;wild intruders. Manu, the monkey, would make sad havoc there among&#10;Tarzan&#39;s treasures should he have access to the interior for even a&#10;few minutes. The question which arose in Tarzan&#39;s mind was a&#10;baffling one. Where did sleep adventures end and reality commence?&#10;How was he to be sure that the cabin door was not really open?&#10;Everything about him appeared quite normal&#8212;there were none of the&#10;grotesque exaggerations of his former sleep adventures. It would be&#10;better then to be upon the safe side and make sure that the cabin&#10;door was closed&#8212;it would do no harm even if all that seemed to be&#10;happening were not happening at all.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan essayed to slip from Bolgani&#39;s shoulder; but the great&#10;beast only growled ominously and gripped him tighter. With a mighty&#10;effort the ape-man wrenched himself loose, and as he slid to the&#10;ground, the dream gorilla turned ferociously upon him, seized him&#10;once more and buried great fangs in a sleek, brown shoulder.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The grin of derision faded from Tarzan&#39;s lips as the pain and&#10;the hot blood aroused his fighting instincts. Asleep or awake, this&#10;thing was no longer a joke! Biting, tearing, and snarling, the two&#10;rolled over upon the ground. The gorilla now was frantic with&#10;insane rage. Again and again he loosed his hold upon the ape-man&#39;s&#10;shoulder in an attempt to seize the jugular; but Tarzan of the Apes&#10;had fought before with creatures who struck first for the vital&#10;vein, and each time he wriggled out of harm&#39;s way as he strove to&#10;get his fingers upon his adversary&#39;s throat. At last he&#10;succeeded&#8212;his great muscles tensed and knotted beneath his smooth&#10;hide as he forced with every ounce of his mighty strength to push&#10;the hairy torso from him. And as he choked Bolgani and strained him&#10;away, his other hand crept slowly upward between them until the&#10;point of the hunting knife rested over the savage heart&#8212;there was a&#10;quick movement of the steel-thewed wrist and the blade plunged to&#10;its goal.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Bolgani, the gorilla, voiced a single frightful shriek, tore&#10;himself loose from the grasp of the ape-man, rose to his feet,&#10;staggered a few steps and then plunged to earth. There were a few&#10;spasmodic movements of the limbs and the brute was still.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan of the Apes stood looking down upon his kill, and as he&#10;stood there he ran his fingers through his thick, black shock of&#10;hair. Presently he stooped and touched the dead body. Some of the&#10;red life-blood of the gorilla crimsoned his fingers. He raised them&#10;to his nose and sniffed. Then he shook his head and turned toward&#10;the cabin. The door was still open. He closed it and fastened the&#10;latch. Returning toward the body of his kill he again paused and&#10;scratched his head.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;If this was a sleep adventure, what then was reality? How was he&#10;to know the one from the other? How much of all that had happened&#10;in his life had been real and how much unreal?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He placed a foot upon the prostrate form and raising his face to&#10;the heavens gave voice to the kill cry of the bull ape. Far in the&#10;distance a lion answered. It was very real and, yet, he did not&#10;know. Puzzled, he turned away into the jungle.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;No, he did not know what was real and what was not; but there&#10;was one thing that he did know&#8212;never again would he eat of the&#10;flesh of Tantor, the elephant.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 15, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/943')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Battle for Teeka'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;THE DAY WAS perfect. A cool breeze tempered the heat of the&#10;equatorial sun. Peace had reigned within the tribe for weeks and no&#10;alien enemy had trespassed upon its preserves from without. To the&#10;ape-mind all this was sufficient evidence that the future would be&#10;identical with the immediate past&#8212;that Utopia would persist.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The sentinels, now from habit become a fixed tribal custom,&#10;either relaxed their vigilance or entirely deserted their posts, as&#10;the whim seized them. The tribe was far scattered in search of&#10;food. Thus may peace and prosperity undermine the safety of the&#10;most primitive community even as it does that of the most&#10;cultured.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Even the individuals became less watchful and alert, so that one&#10;might have thought Numa and Sabor and Sheeta entirely deleted from&#10;the scheme of things. The shes and the balus roamed unguarded&#10;through the sullen jungle, while the greedy males foraged far&#10;afield, and thus it was that Teeka and Gazan, her balu, hunted upon&#10;the extreme southern edge of the tribe with no great male near&#10;them.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Still farther south there moved through the forest a sinister&#10;figure&#8212;a huge bull ape, maddened by solitude and defeat. A week&#10;before he had contended for the kingship of a tribe far distant,&#10;and now battered, and still sore, he roamed the wilderness an&#10;outcast. Later he might return to his own tribe and submit to the&#10;will of the hairy brute he had attempted to dethrone; but for the&#10;time being he dared not do so, since he had sought not only the&#10;crown but the wives, as well, of his lord and master. It would&#10;require an entire moon at least to bring forgetfulness to him he&#10;had wronged, and so Toog wandered a strange jungle, grim, terrible,&#10;hate-filled.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was in this mental state that Toog came unexpectedly upon a&#10;young she feeding alone in the jungle&#8212;a stranger she, lithe and&#10;strong and beautiful beyond compare. Toog caught his breath and&#10;slunk quickly to one side of the trail where the dense foliage of&#10;the tropical underbrush concealed him from Teeka while permitting&#10;him to feast his eyes upon her loveliness.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But not alone were they concerned with Teeka&#8212;they roved the&#10;surrounding jungle in search of the bulls and cows and balus of her&#10;tribe, though principally for the bulls. When one covets a she of&#10;an alien tribe one must take into consideration the great, fierce,&#10;hairy guardians who seldom wander far from their wards and who will&#10;fight a stranger to the death in protection of the mate or&#10;offspring of a fellow, precisely as they would fight for their&#10;own.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Toog could see no sign of any ape other than the strange she and&#10;a young balu playing near by. His wicked, blood-shot eyes half&#10;closed as they rested upon the charms of the former&#8212;as for the&#10;balu, one snap of those great jaws upon the back of its little neck&#10;would prevent it from raising any unnecessary alarm.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Toog was a fine, big male, resembling in many ways Teeka&#39;s mate,&#10;Taug. Each was in his prime, and each was wonderfully muscled,&#10;perfectly fanged and as horrifyingly ferocious as the most exacting&#10;and particular she could wish. Had Toog been of her own tribe,&#10;Teeka might as readily have yielded to him as to Taug when her&#10;mating time arrived; but now she was Taug&#39;s and no other male could&#10;claim her without first defeating Taug in personal combat. And even&#10;then Teeka retained some rights in the matter. If she did not favor&#10;a correspondent, she could enter the lists with her rightful mate&#10;and do her part toward discouraging his advances, a part, too,&#10;which would prove no mean assistance to her lord and master, for&#10;Teeka, even though her fangs were smaller than a male&#39;s, could use&#10;them to excellent effect.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Just now Teeka was occupied in a fascinating search for beetles,&#10;to the exclusion of all else. She did not realize how far she and&#10;Gazan had become separated from the balance of the tribe, nor were&#10;her defensive senses upon the alert as they should have been.&#10;Months of immunity from danger under the protecting watchfulness of&#10;the sentries, which Tarzan had taught the tribe to post, had lulled&#10;them all into a sense of peaceful security based on that fallacy&#10;which has wrecked many enlightened communities in the past and will&#10;continue to wreck others in the future&#8212;that because they have not&#10;been attacked they never will be.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Toog, having satisfied himself that only the she and her balu&#10;were in the immediate vicinity, crept stealthily forward. Teeka&#39;s&#10;back was toward him when he finally rushed upon her; but her senses&#10;were at last awakened to the presence of danger and she wheeled to&#10;face the strange bull just before he reached her. Toog halted a few&#10;paces from her. His anger had fled before the seductive feminine&#10;charms of the stranger. He made conciliatory noises&#8212;a species of&#10;clucking sound with his broad, flat lips&#8212;that were, too, not&#10;greatly dissimilar to that which might be produced in an osculatory&#10;solo.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But Teeka only bared her fangs and growled. Little Gazan started&#10;to run toward his mother, but she warned him away with a quick&#10;&#34;Kreeg-ah!&#34; telling him to run high into a tall tree. Evidently&#10;Teeka was not favorably impressed by her new suitor. Toog realized&#10;this and altered his methods accordingly. He swelled his giant&#10;chest, beat upon it with his calloused knuckles and swaggered to&#10;and fro before her.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I am Toog,&#34; he boasted. &#34;Look at my fighting fangs. Look at my&#10;great arms and my mighty legs. With one bite I can slay your&#10;biggest bull. Alone have I slain Sheeta. I am Toog. Toog wants&#10;you.&#34; Then he waited for the effect, nor did he have long to wait.&#10;Teeka turned with a swiftness which belied her great weight and&#10;bolted in the opposite direction. Toog, with an angry growl, leaped&#10;in pursuit; but the smaller, lighter female was too fleet for him.&#10;He chased her for a few yards and then, foaming and barking, he&#10;halted and beat upon the ground with his hard fists.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;From the tree above him little Gazan looked down and witnessed&#10;the stranger bull&#39;s discomfiture. Being young, and thinking himself&#10;safe above the reach of the heavy male, Gazan screamed an ill-timed&#10;insult at their tormentor. Toog looked up. Teeka had halted at a&#10;little distance&#8212;she would not go far from her balu; that Toog&#10;quickly realized and as quickly determined to take advantage of. He&#10;saw that the tree in which the young ape squatted was isolated and&#10;that Gazan could not reach another without coming to earth. He&#10;would obtain the mother through her love for her young.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He swung himself into the lower branches of the tree. Little&#10;Gazan ceased to insult him; his expression of deviltry changed to&#10;one of apprehension, which was quickly followed by fear as Toog&#10;commenced to ascend toward him. Teeka screamed to Gazan to climb&#10;higher, and the little fellow scampered upward among the tiny&#10;branches which would not support the weight of the great bull; but&#10;nevertheless Toog kept on climbing. Teeka was not fearful. She knew&#10;that he could not ascend far enough to reach Gazan, so she sat at a&#10;little distance from the tree and applied jungle opprobrium to him.&#10;Being a female, she was a past master of the art.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But she did not know the malevolent cunning of Toog&#39;s little&#10;brain. She took it for granted that the bull would climb as high as&#10;he could toward Gazan and then, finding that he could not reach&#10;him, resume his pursuit of her, which she knew would prove equally&#10;fruitless. So sure was she of the safety of her balu and her own&#10;ability to take care of herself that she did not voice the cry for&#10;help which would soon have brought the other members of the tribe&#10;flocking to her side.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Toog slowly reached the limit to which he dared risk his great&#10;weight to the slender branches. Gazan was still fifteen feet above&#10;him. The bull braced himself and seized the main branch in his&#10;powerful hands, then he commenced shaking it vigorously. Teeka was&#10;appalled. Instantly she realized what the bull purposed. Gazan&#10;clung far out upon a swaying limb. At the first shake he lost his&#10;balance, though he did not quite fall, clinging still with his four&#10;hands; but Toog redoubled his efforts; the shaking produced a&#10;violent snapping of the limb to which the young ape clung. Teeka&#10;saw all too plainly what the outcome must be and forgetting her own&#10;danger in the depth of her mother love, rushed forward to ascend&#10;the tree and give battle to the fearsome creature that menaced the&#10;life of her little one.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But before ever she reached the bole, Toog had succeeded, by&#10;violent shaking of the branch, to loosen Gazan&#39;s hold. With a cry&#10;the little fellow plunged down through the foliage, clutching&#10;futilely for a new hold, and alighted with a sickening thud at his&#10;mother&#39;s feet, where he lay silent and motionless. Moaning, Teeka&#10;stooped to lift the still form in her arms; but at the same instant&#10;Toog was upon her.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Struggling and biting she fought to free herself; but the giant&#10;muscles of the great bull were too much for her lesser strength.&#10;Toog struck and choked her repeatedly until finally, half&#10;unconscious, she lapsed into quasi submission. Then the bull lifted&#10;her to his shoulder and turned back to the trail toward the south&#10;from whence he had come.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Upon the ground lay the quiet form of little Gazan. He did not&#10;moan. He did not move. The sun rose slowly toward meridian. A mangy&#10;thing, lifting its nose to scent the jungle breeze, crept through&#10;the underbrush. It was Dango, the hyena. Presently its ugly muzzle&#10;broke through some near-by foliage and its cruel eyes fastened upon&#10;Gazan.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Early that morning, Tarzan of the Apes had gone to the cabin by&#10;the sea, where he passed many an hour at such times as the tribe&#10;was ranging in the vicinity. On the floor lay the skeleton of a&#10;man&#8212;all that remained of the former Lord Greystoke&#8212;lay as it had&#10;fallen some twenty years before when Kerchak, the great ape, had&#10;thrown it, lifeless, there. Long since had the termites and the&#10;small rodents picked clean the sturdy English bones. For years&#10;Tarzan had seen it lying there, giving it no more attention than he&#10;gave the countless thousand bones that strewed his jungle haunts.&#10;On the bed another, smaller, skeleton reposed and the youth ignored&#10;it as he ignored the other. How could he know that the one had been&#10;his father, the other his mother? The little pile of bones in the&#10;rude cradle, fashioned with such loving care by the former Lord&#10;Greystoke, meant nothing to him&#8212; that one day that little skull was&#10;to help prove his right to a proud title was as far beyond his ken&#10;as the satellites of the suns of Orion. To Tarzan they were&#10;bones&#8212;just bones. He did not need them, for there was no meat left&#10;upon them, and they were not in his way, for he knew no necessity&#10;for a bed, and the skeleton upon the floor he easily could step&#10;over.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Today he was restless. He turned the pages first of one book and&#10;then of another. He glanced at pictures which he knew by heart, and&#10;tossed the books aside. He rummaged for the thousandth time in the&#10;cupboard. He took out a bag which contained several small, round&#10;pieces of metal. He had played with them many times in the years&#10;gone by; but always he replaced them carefully in the bag, and the&#10;bag in the cupboard, upon the very shelf where first he had&#10;discovered it. In strange ways did heredity manifest itself in the&#10;ape-man. Come of an orderly race, he himself was orderly without&#10;knowing why. The apes dropped things wherever their interest in&#10;them waned&#8212;in the tall grass or from the high-flung branches of the&#10;trees. What they dropped they sometimes found again, by accident;&#10;but not so the ways of Tarzan. For his few belongings he had a&#10;place and scrupulously he returned each thing to its proper place&#10;when he was done with it. The round pieces of metal in the little&#10;bag always interested him. Raised pictures were upon either side,&#10;the meaning of which he did not quite understand. The pieces were&#10;bright and shiny. It amused him to arrange them in various figures&#10;upon the table. Hundreds of times had he played thus. Today, while&#10;so engaged, he dropped a lovely yellow piece&#8212; an English&#10;sovereign&#8212;which rolled beneath the bed where lay all that was&#10;mortal of the once beautiful Lady Alice.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;True to form, Tarzan at once dropped to his hands and knees and&#10;searched beneath the bed for the lost gold piece. Strange as it&#10;might appear, he had never before looked beneath the bed. He found&#10;the gold piece, and something else he found, too&#8212;a small wooden box&#10;with a loose cover. Bringing them both out he returned the&#10;sovereign to its bag and the bag to its shelf within the cupboard;&#10;then he investigated the box. It contained a quantity of&#10;cylindrical bits of metal, cone-shaped at one end and flat at the&#10;other, with a projecting rim. They were all quite green and dull,&#10;coated with years of verdigris.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan removed a handful of them from the box and examined them.&#10;He rubbed one upon another and discovered that the green came off,&#10;leaving a shiny surface for two-thirds of their length and a dull&#10;gray over the cone-shaped end. Finding a bit of wood he rubbed one&#10;of the cylinders rapidly and was rewarded by a lustrous sheen which&#10;pleased him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At his side hung a pocket pouch taken from the body of one of&#10;the numerous black warriors he had slain. Into this pouch he put a&#10;handful of the new playthings, thinking to polish them at his&#10;leisure; then he replaced the box beneath the bed, and finding&#10;nothing more to amuse him, left the cabin and started back in the&#10;direction of the tribe.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Shortly before he reached them he heard a great commotion ahead&#10;of him&#8212;the loud screams of shes and balus, the savage, angry&#10;barking and growling of the great bulls. Instantly he increased his&#10;speed, for the &#34;Kreeg-ahs&#34; that came to his ears warned him that&#10;something was amiss with his fellows.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;While Tarzan had been occupied with his own devices in the cabin&#10;of his dead sire, Taug, Teeka&#39;s mighty mate, had been hunting a&#10;mile to the north of the tribe. At last, his belly filled, he had&#10;turned lazily back toward the clearing where he had last seen the&#10;tribe and presently commenced passing its members scattered alone&#10;or in twos or threes. Nowhere did he see Teeka or Gazan, and soon&#10;he began inquiring of the other apes where they might be; but none&#10;had seen them recently.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now the lower orders are not highly imaginative. They do not, as&#10;you and I, paint vivid mental pictures of things which might have&#10;occurred, and so Taug did not now apprehend that any misfortune had&#10;overtaken his mate and their off-spring&#8212; he merely knew that he&#10;wished to find Teeka that he might lie down in the shade and have&#10;her scratch his back while his breakfast digested; but though he&#10;called to her and searched for her and asked each whom he met, he&#10;could find no trace of Teeka, nor of Gazan either.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He was beginning to become peeved and had about made up his mind&#10;to chastise Teeka for wandering so far afield when he wanted her.&#10;He was moving south along a game trail, his calloused soles and&#10;knuckles giving forth no sound, when he came upon Dango at the&#10;opposite side of a small clearing. The eater of carrion did not see&#10;Taug, for all his eyes were for something which lay in the grass&#10;beneath a tree&#8212;something upon which he was sneaking with the&#10;cautious stealth of his breed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Taug, always cautious himself, as it behooves one to be who&#10;fares up and down the jungle and desires to survive, swung&#10;noiselessly into a tree, where he could have a better view of the&#10;clearing. He did not fear Dango; but he wanted to see what it was&#10;that Dango stalked. In a way, possibly, he was actuated as much by&#10;curiosity as by caution.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And when Taug reached a place in the branches from which he&#10;could have an unobstructed view of the clearing he saw Dango&#10;already sniffing at something directly beneath him&#8212; something which&#10;Taug instantly recognized as the lifeless form of his little&#10;Gazan.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With a cry so frightful, so bestial, that it momentarily&#10;paralyzed the startled Dango, the great ape launched his mighty&#10;bulk upon the surprised hyena. With a cry and a snarl, Dango,&#10;crushed to earth, turned to tear at his assailant; but as&#10;effectively might a sparrow turn upon a hawk. Taug&#39;s great, gnarled&#10;fingers closed upon the hyena&#39;s throat and back, his jaws snapped&#10;once on the mangy neck, crushing the vertebrae, and then he hurled&#10;the dead body contemptuously aside.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Again he raised his voice in the call of the bull ape to its&#10;mate, but there was no reply; then he leaned down to sniff at the&#10;body of Gazan. In the breast of this savage, hideous beast there&#10;beat a heart which was moved, however slightly, by the same&#10;emotions of paternal love which affect us. Even had we no actual&#10;evidence of this, we must know it still, since only thus might be&#10;explained the survival of the human race in which the jealousy and&#10;selfishness of the bulls would, in the earliest stages of the race,&#10;have wiped out the young as rapidly as they were brought into the&#10;world had not God implanted in the savage bosom that paternal love&#10;which evidences itself most strongly in the protective instinct of&#10;the male.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In Taug the protective instinct was not alone highly developed;&#10;but affection for his offspring as well, for Taug was an unusually&#10;intelligent specimen of these great, manlike apes which the natives&#10;of the Gobi speak of in whispers; but which no white man ever had&#10;seen, or, if seeing, lived to tell of until Tarzan of the Apes came&#10;among them.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And so Taug felt sorrow as any other father might feel sorrow at&#10;the loss of a little child. To you little Gazan might have seemed a&#10;hideous and repulsive creature, but to Taug and Teeka he was as&#10;beautiful and as cute as is your little Mary or Johnnie or&#10;Elizabeth Ann to you, and he was their firstborn, their only balu,&#10;and a he&#8212;three things which might make a young ape the apple of any&#10;fond father&#39;s eye.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For a moment Taug sniffed at the quiet little form. With his&#10;muzzle and his tongue he smoothed and caressed the rumpled coat.&#10;From his savage lips broke a low moan; but quickly upon the heels&#10;of sorrow came the overmastering desire for revenge.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Leaping to his feet he screamed out a volley of &#34;Kreegahs,&#34;&#10;punctuated from time to time by the blood-freezing cry of an angry,&#10;challenging bull&#8212;a rage-mad bull with the blood lust strong upon&#10;him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Answering his cries came the cries of the tribe as they swung&#10;through the trees toward him. It was these that Tarzan heard on his&#10;return from his cabin, and in reply to them he raised his own voice&#10;and hurried forward with increased speed until he fairly flew&#10;through the middle terraces of the forest.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When at last he came upon the tribe he saw their members&#10;gathered about Taug and something which lay quietly upon the&#10;ground. Dropping among them, Tarzan approached the center of the&#10;group. Taug was stiff roaring out his challenges; but when he saw&#10;Tarzan he ceased and stooping picked up Gazan in his arms and held&#10;him out for Tarzan to see. Of all the bulls of the tribe, Taug held&#10;affection for Tarzan only. Tarzan he trusted and looked up to as&#10;one wiser and more cunning. To Tarzan he came now&#8212;to the playmate&#10;of his balu days, the companion of innumerable battles of his&#10;maturity.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When Tarzan saw the still form in Taug&#39;s arms, a low growl broke&#10;from his lips, for he too loved Teeka&#39;s little balu.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Who did it?&#34; he asked. &#34;Where is Teeka?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I do not know,&#34; replied Taug. &#34;I found him lying here with&#10;Dango about to feed upon him; but it was not Dango that did&#10;it&#8212;there are no fang marks upon him.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan came closer and placed an ear against Gazan&#39;s breast. &#34;He&#10;is not dead,&#34; he said. &#34;Maybe he will not die.&#34; He pressed through&#10;the crowd of apes and circled once about them, examining the ground&#10;step by step. Suddenly he stopped and placing his nose close to the&#10;earth sniffed. Then he sprang to his feet, giving a peculiar cry.&#10;Taug and the others pressed forward, for the sound told them that&#10;the hunter had found the spoor of his quarry.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;A stranger bull has been here,&#34; said Tarzan. &#34;It was he that&#10;hurt Gazan. He has carried off Teeka.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Taug and the other bulls commenced to roar and threaten; but&#10;they did nothing. Had the stranger bull been within sight they&#10;would have torn him to pieces; but it did not occur to them to&#10;follow him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;If the three bulls had been watching around the tribe this&#10;would not have happened,&#34; said Tarzan. &#34;Such things will happen as&#10;long as you do not keep the three bulls watching for an enemy. The&#10;jungle is full of enemies, and yet you let your shes and your balus&#10;feed where they will, alone and unprotected. Tarzan goes now&#8212;he&#10;goes to find Teeka and bring her back to the tribe.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The idea appealed to the other bulls. &#34;We will all go,&#34; they&#10;cried.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No,&#34; said Tarzan, &#34;you will not all go. We cannot take shes and&#10;balus when we go out to hunt and fight. You must remain to guard&#10;them or you will lose them all.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;They scratched their heads. The wisdom of his advice was dawning&#10;upon them, but at first they had been carried away by the new&#10;idea&#8212;the idea of following up an enemy offender to wrest his prize&#10;from him and punish him. The community instinct was ingrained in&#10;their characters through ages of custom. They did not know why they&#10;had not thought to pursue and punish the offender&#8212;they could not&#10;know that it was because they had as yet not reached a mental plane&#10;which would permit them to work as individuals. In times of stress,&#10;the community instinct sent them huddling into a compact herd where&#10;the great bulls, by the weight of their combined strength and&#10;ferocity, could best protect them from an enemy. The idea of&#10;separating to do battle with a foe had not yet occurred to them&#8212;it&#10;was too foreign to custom, too inimical to community interests; but&#10;to Tarzan it was the first and most natural thought. His senses&#10;told him that there was but a single bull connected with the attack&#10;upon Teeka and Gazan. A single enemy did not require the entire&#10;tribe for his punishment. Two swift bulls could quickly overhaul&#10;him and rescue Teeka.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In the past no one ever had thought to go forth in search of the&#10;shes that were occasionally stolen from the tribe. If Numa, Sabor,&#10;Sheeta or a wandering bull ape from another tribe chanced to carry&#10;off a maid or a matron while no one was looking, that was the end&#10;of it&#8212;she was gone, that was all. The bereaved husband, if the&#10;victim chanced to have been mated, growled around for a day or two&#10;and then, if he were strong enough, took another mate within the&#10;tribe, and if not, wandered far into the jungle on the chance of&#10;stealing one from another community.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In the past Tarzan of the Apes had condoned this practice for&#10;the reason that he had had no interest in those who had been&#10;stolen; but Teeka had been his first love and Teeka&#39;s balu held a&#10;place in his heart such as a balu of his own would have held. Just&#10;once before had Tarzan wished to follow and revenge. That had been&#10;years before when Kulonga, the son of Mbonga, the chief, had slain&#10;Kala. Then, single-handed, Tarzan had pursued and avenged. Now,&#10;though to a lesser degree, he was moved by the same passion.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He turned toward Taug. &#34;Leave Gazan with Mumga,&#34; he said. &#34;She&#10;is old and her fangs are broken and she is no good; but she can&#10;take care of Gazan until we return with Teeka, and if Gazan is dead&#10;when we come back,&#34; he turned to address Mumga, &#34;I will kill you,&#10;too.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Where are we going?&#34; asked Taug.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;We are going to get Teeka,&#34; replied the ape-man, &#34;and kill the&#10;bull who has stolen her. Come!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He turned again to the spoor of the stranger bull, which showed&#10;plainly to his trained senses, nor did he glance back to note if&#10;Taug followed. The latter laid Gazan in Mumga&#39;s arms with a&#10;parting: &#34;If he dies Tarzan will kill you,&#34; and he followed after&#10;the brown-skinned figure that already was moving at a slow trot&#10;along the jungle trail.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;No other bull of the tribe of Kerchak was so good a trailer as&#10;Tarzan, for his trained senses were aided by a high order of&#10;intelligence. His judgment told him the natural trail for a quarry&#10;to follow, so that he need but note the most apparent marks upon&#10;the way, and today the trail of Toog was as plain to him as type&#10;upon a printed page to you or me.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Following close behind the lithe figure of the ape-man came the&#10;huge and shaggy bull ape. No words passed between them. They moved&#10;as silently as two shadows among the myriad shadows of the forest.&#10;Alert as his eyes and ears, was Tarzan&#39;s patrician nose. The spoor&#10;was fresh, and now that they had passed from the range of the&#10;strong ape odor of the tribe he had little difficulty in following&#10;Toog and Teeka by scent alone. Teeka&#39;s familiar scent spoor told&#10;both Tarzan and Taug that they were upon her trail, and soon the&#10;scent of Toog became as familiar as the other.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;They were progressing rapidly when suddenly dense clouds&#10;overcast the sun. Tarzan accelerated his pace. Now he fairly flew&#10;along the jungle trail, or, where Toog had taken to the trees,&#10;followed nimbly as a squirrel along the bending, undulating pathway&#10;of the foliage branches, swinging from tree to tree as Toog had&#10;swung before them; but more rapidly because they were not&#10;handicapped by a burden such as Toog&#39;s.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan felt that they must be almost upon the quarry, for the&#10;scent spoor was becoming stronger and stronger, when the jungle was&#10;suddenly shot by livid lightning, and a deafening roar of thunder&#10;reverberated through the heavens and the forest until the earth&#10;trembled and shook. Then came the rain&#8212;not as it comes to us of the&#10;temperate zones, but as a mighty avalanche of water&#8212;a deluge which&#10;spills tons instead of drops upon the bending forest giants and the&#10;terrified creatures which haunt their shade.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And the rain did what Tarzan knew that it would do&#8212; it wiped the&#10;spoor of the quarry from the face of the earth. For a half hour the&#10;torrents fell&#8212;then the sun burst forth, jeweling the forest with a&#10;million scintillant gems; but today the ape-man, usually alert to&#10;the changing wonders of the jungle, saw them not. Only the fact&#10;that the spoor of Teeka and her abductor was obliterated found&#10;lodgment in his thoughts.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Even among the branches of the trees there are well-worn trails,&#10;just as there are trails upon the surface of the ground; but in the&#10;trees they branch and cross more often, since the way is more open&#10;than among the dense undergrowth at the surface. Along one of these&#10;well-marked trails Tarzan and Taug continued after the rain had&#10;ceased, because the ape-man knew that this was the most logical&#10;path for the thief to follow; but when they came to a fork, they&#10;were at a loss. Here they halted, while Tarzan examined every&#10;branch and leaf which might have been touched by the fleeing&#10;ape.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He sniffed the bole of the tree, and with his keen eyes he&#10;sought to find upon the bark some sign of the way the quarry had&#10;taken. It was slow work and all the time, Tarzan knew, the bull of&#10;the alien tribe was forging steadily away from them&#8212;gaining&#10;precious minutes that might carry him to safety before they could&#10;catch up with him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;First along one fork he went, and then another, applying every&#10;test that his wonderful junglecraft was cognizant of; but again and&#10;again he was baffled, for the scent had been washed away by the&#10;heavy downpour, in every exposed place. For a half hour Tarzan and&#10;Taug searched, until at last, upon the bottom of a broad leaf,&#10;Tarzan&#39;s keen nose caught the faint trace of the scent spoor of&#10;Toog, where the leaf had brushed a hairy shoulder as the great ape&#10;passed through the foliage.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Once again the two took up the trail, but it was slow work now&#10;and there were many discouraging delays when the spoor seemed lost&#10;beyond recovery. To you or me there would have been no spoor, even&#10;before the coming of the rain, except, possibly, where Toog had&#10;come to earth and followed a game trail. In such places the imprint&#10;of a huge handlike foot and the knuckles of one great hand were&#10;sometimes plain enough for an ordinary mortal to read. Tarzan knew&#10;from these and other indications that the ape was yet carrying&#10;Teeka. The depth of the imprint of his feet indicated a much&#10;greater weight than that of any of the larger bulls, for they were&#10;made under the combined weight of Toog and Teeka, while the fact&#10;that the knuckles of but one hand touched the ground at any time&#10;showed that the other hand was occupied in some other business&#8212;the&#10;business of holding the prisoner to a hairy shoulder. Tarzan could&#10;follow, in sheltered places, the changing of the burden from one&#10;shoulder to another, as indicated by the deepening of the foot&#10;imprint upon the side of the load, and the changing of the knuckle&#10;imprints from one side of the trail to the other.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There were stretches along the surface paths where the ape had&#10;gone for considerable distances entirely erect upon his hind&#10;feet&#8212;walking as a man walks; but the same might have been true of&#10;any of the great anthropoids of the same species, for, unlike the&#10;chimpanzee and the gorilla, they walk without the aid of their&#10;hands quite as readily as with. It was such things, however, which&#10;helped to identify to Tarzan and to Taug the appearance of the&#10;abductor, and with his individual scent characteristic already&#10;indelibly impressed upon their memories, they were in a far better&#10;position to know him when they came upon him, even should he have&#10;disposed of Teeka before, than is a modern sleuth with his&#10;photographs and Bertillon measurements, equipped to recognize a&#10;fugitive from civilized justice.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But with all their high-strung and delicately attuned perceptive&#10;faculties the two bulls of the tribe of Kerchak were often sore&#10;pressed to follow the trail at all, and at best were so delayed&#10;that in the afternoon of the second day, they still had not&#10;overhauled the fugitive. The scent was now strong, for it had been&#10;made since the rain, and Tarzan knew that it would not be long&#10;before they came upon the thief and his loot. Above them, as they&#10;crept stealthily forward, chattered Manu, the monkey, and his&#10;thousand fellows; squawked and screamed the brazen-throated birds&#10;of plumage; buzzed and hummed the countless insects amid the&#10;rustling of the forest leaves, and, as they passed, a little&#10;gray-beard, squeaking and scolding upon a swaying branch, looked&#10;down and saw them. Instantly the scolding and squeaking ceased, and&#10;off tore the long-tailed mite as though Sheeta, the panther, had&#10;been endowed with wings and was in close pursuit of him. To all&#10;appearances he was only a very much frightened little monkey,&#10;fleeing for his life&#8212;there seemed nothing sinister about him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And what of Teeka during all this time? Was she at last resigned&#10;to her fate and accompanying her new mate in the proper humility of&#10;a loving and tractable spouse? A single glance at the pair would&#10;have answered these questions to the utter satisfaction of the most&#10;captious. She was torn and bleeding from many wounds, inflicted by&#10;the sullen Toog in his vain efforts to subdue her to his will, and&#10;Toog too was disfigured and mutilated; but with stubborn ferocity,&#10;he still clung to his now useless prize.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;On through the jungle he forced his way in the direction of the&#10;stamping ground of his tribe. He hoped that his king would have&#10;forgotten his treason; but if not he was still resigned to his&#10;fate&#8212;any fate would be better than suffering longer the sole&#10;companionship of this frightful she, and then, too, he wished to&#10;exhibit his captive to his fellows. Maybe he could wish her on the&#10;king&#8212;it is possible that such a thought urged him on.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At last they came upon two bulls feeding in a parklike grove&#8212;a&#10;beautiful grove dotted with huge boulders half embedded in the rich&#10;loam&#8212;mute monuments, possibly, to a forgotten age when mighty&#10;glaciers rolled their slow course where now a torrid sun beats down&#10;upon a tropic jungle.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The two bulls looked up, baring long fighting fangs, as Toog&#10;appeared in the distance. The latter recognized the two as friends.&#10;&#34;It is Toog,&#34; he growled. &#34;Toog has come back with a new she.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The apes waited his nearer approach. Teeka turned a snarling,&#10;fanged face toward them. She was not pretty to look upon, yet&#10;through the blood and hatred upon her countenance they realized&#10;that she was beautiful, and they envied Toog&#8212;alas! they did not&#10;know Teeka.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As they squatted looking at one another there raced through the&#10;trees toward them a long-tailed little monkey with gray whiskers.&#10;He was a very excited little monkey when he came to a halt upon the&#10;limb of a tree directly overhead. &#34;Two strange bulls come,&#34; he&#10;cried. One is a Mangani, the other a hideous ape without hair upon&#10;his body. They follow the spoor of Toog. I saw them.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The four apes turned their eyes backward along the trail Toog&#10;had just come; then they looked at one another for a minute.&#10;&#34;Come,&#34; said the larger of Toog&#39;s two friends, &#34;we will wait for&#10;the strangers in the thick bushes beyond the clearing.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He turned and waddled away across the open place, the others&#10;following him. The little monkey danced about, all excitement. His&#10;chief diversion in life was to bring about bloody encounters&#10;between the larger denizens of the forest, that he might sit in the&#10;safety of the trees and witness the spectacles. He was a glutton&#10;for gore, was this little, whiskered, gray monkey, so long as it&#10;was the gore of others&#8212; a typical fight fan was the graybeard.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The apes hid themselves in the shrubbery beside the trail along&#10;which the two stranger bulls would pass. Teeka trembled with&#10;excitement. She had heard the words of Manu, and she knew that the&#10;hairless ape must be Tarzan, while the other was, doubtless, Taug.&#10;Never, in her wildest hopes, had she expected succor of this sort.&#10;Her one thought had been to escape and find her way back to the&#10;tribe of Kerchak; but even this had appeared to her practically&#10;impossible, so closely did Toog watch her.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As Taug and Tarzan reached the grove where Toog had come upon&#10;his friends, the ape scent became so strong that both knew the&#10;quarry was but a short distance ahead. And so they went even more&#10;cautiously, for they wished to come upon the thief from behind if&#10;they could and charge him before he was aware of their presence.&#10;That a little gray-whiskered monkey had forestalled them they did&#10;not know, nor that three pairs of savage eyes were already watching&#10;their every move and waiting for them to come within reach of&#10;itching paws and slavering jowls.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;On they came across the grove, and as they entered the path&#10;leading into the dense jungle beyond, a sudden &#34;Kreeg-ah!&#34; shrilled&#10;out close before them&#8212;a &#34;Kreeg-ah&#34; in the familiar voice of Teeka.&#10;The small brains of Toog and his companions had not been able to&#10;foresee that Teeka might betray them, and now that she had, they&#10;went wild with rage. Toog struck the she a mighty blow that felled&#10;her, and then the three rushed forth to do battle with Tarzan and&#10;Taug. The little monkey danced upon his perch and screamed with&#10;delight.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And indeed he might well be delighted, for it was a lovely&#10;fight. There were no preliminaries, no formalities, no&#10;introductions&#8212; the five bulls merely charged and clinched. They&#10;rolled in the narrow trail and into the thick verdure beside it.&#10;They bit and clawed and scratched and struck, and all the while&#10;they kept up the most frightful chorus of growlings and barkings&#10;and roarings. In five minutes they were torn and bleeding, and the&#10;little graybeard leaped high, shrilling his primitive bravos; but&#10;always his attitude was &#34;thumbs down.&#34; He wanted to see something&#10;killed. He did not care whether it were friend or foe. It was blood&#10;he wanted&#8212;blood and death.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Taug had been set upon by Toog and another of the apes, while&#10;Tarzan had the third&#8212;a huge brute with the strength of a buffalo.&#10;Never before had Tarzan&#39;s assailant beheld so strange a creature as&#10;this slippery, hairless bull with which he battled. Sweat and blood&#10;covered Tarzan&#39;s sleek, brown hide. Again and again he slipped from&#10;the clutches of the great bull, and all the while he struggled to&#10;free his hunting knife from the scabbard in which it had stuck.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At length he succeeded&#8212;a brown hand shot out and clutched a&#10;hairy throat, another flew upward clutching the sharp blade. Three&#10;swift, powerful strokes and the bull relaxed with a groan, falling&#10;limp beneath his antagonist. Instantly Tarzan broke from the&#10;clutches of the dying bull and sprang to Taug&#39;s assistance. Toog&#10;saw him coming and wheeled to meet him. In the impact of the&#10;charge, Tarzan&#39;s knife was wrenched from his hand and then Toog&#10;closed with him. Now was the battle even&#8212;two against two&#8212;while on&#10;the verge, Teeka, now recovered from the blow that had felled her,&#10;slunk waiting for an opportunity to aid. She saw Tarzan&#39;s knife and&#10;picked it up. She never had used it, but knew how Tarzan used it.&#10;Always had she been afraid of the thing which dealt death to the&#10;mightiest of the jungle people with the ease that Tantor&#39;s great&#10;tusks deal death to Tantor&#39;s enemies.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She saw Tarzan&#39;s pocket pouch torn from his side, and with the&#10;curiosity of an ape, that even danger and excitement cannot&#10;entirely dispel, she picked this up, too.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now the bulls were standing&#8212;the clinches had been broken. Blood&#10;streamed down their sides&#8212;their faces were crimsoned with it.&#10;Little graybeard was so fascinated that at last he had even&#10;forgotten to scream and dance; but sat rigid with delight in the&#10;enjoyment of the spectacle.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Back across the grove Tarzan and Taug forced their adversaries.&#10;Teeka followed slowly. She scarce knew what to do. She was lame and&#10;sore and exhausted from the frightful ordeal through which she had&#10;passed, and she had the confidence of her sex in the prowess of her&#10;mate and the other bull of her tribe&#8212;they would not need the help&#10;of a she in their battle with these two strangers.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The roars and screams of the fighters reverberated through the&#10;jungle, awakening the echoes in the distant hills. From the throat&#10;of Tarzan&#39;s antagonist had come a score of &#34;Kreeg-ahs!&#34; and now&#10;from behind came the reply he had awaited. Into the grove, barking&#10;and growling, came a score of huge bull apes&#8212;the fighting men of&#10;Toog&#39;s tribe.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Teeka saw them first and screamed a warning to Tarzan and Taug.&#10;Then she fled past the fighters toward the opposite side of the&#10;clearing, fear for a moment claiming her. Nor can one censure her&#10;after the frightful ordeal from which she was still suffering.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Down upon them came the great apes. In a moment Tarzan and Taug&#10;would be torn to shreds that would later form the PIECE DE&#10;RESISTANCE of the savage orgy of a Dum-Dum. Teeka turned to glance&#10;back. She saw the impending fate of her defenders and there sprung&#10;to life in her savage bosom the spark of martyrdom, that some&#10;common forbear had transmitted alike to Teeka, the wild ape, and&#10;the glorious women of a higher order who have invited death for&#10;their men. With a shrill scream she ran toward the battlers who&#10;were rolling in a great mass at the foot of one of the huge&#10;boulders which dotted the grove; but what could she do? The knife&#10;she held she could not use to advantage because of her lesser&#10;strength. She had seen Tarzan throw missiles, and she had learned&#10;this with many other things from her childhood playmate. She sought&#10;for something to throw and at last her fingers touched upon the&#10;hard objects in the pouch that had been torn from the ape-man.&#10;Tearing the receptacle open, she gathered a handful of shiny&#10;cylinders&#8212;heavy for their size, they seemed to her, and good&#10;missiles. With all her strength she hurled them at the apes&#10;battling in front of the granite boulder.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The result surprised Teeka quite as much as it did the apes.&#10;There was a loud explosion, which deafened the fighters, and a puff&#10;of acrid smoke. Never before had one there heard such a frightful&#10;noise. Screaming with terror, the stranger bulls leaped to their&#10;feet and fled back toward the stamping ground of their tribe, while&#10;Taug and Tarzan slowly gathered themselves together and arose, lame&#10;and bleeding, to their feet. They, too, would have fled had they&#10;not seen Teeka standing there before them, the knife and the pocket&#10;pouch in her hands.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What was it?&#34; asked Tarzan.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Teeka shook her head. &#34;I hurled these at the stranger bulls,&#34;&#10;and she held forth another handful of the shiny metal cylinders&#10;with the dull gray, cone-shaped ends.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan looked at them and scratched his head.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What are they?&#34; asked Taug.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I do not know,&#34; said Tarzan. &#34;I found them.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The little monkey with the gray beard halted among the trees a&#10;mile away and huddled, terrified, against a branch. He did not know&#10;that the dead father of Tarzan of the Apes, reaching back out of&#10;the past across a span of twenty years, had saved his son&#39;s&#10;life.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Nor did Tarzan, Lord Greystoke, know it either.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 15, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/943')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode(' A&#10;Jungle Joke'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;TIME SELDOM HUNG heavily upon Tarzan&#39;s hands. Even where there&#10;is sameness there cannot be monotony if most of the sameness&#10;consists in dodging death first in one form and then in another; or&#10;in inflicting death upon others. There is a spice to such an&#10;existence; but even this Tarzan of the Apes varied in activities of&#10;his own invention.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He was full grown now, with the grace of a Greek god and the&#10;thews of a bull, and, by all the tenets of apedom, should have been&#10;sullen, morose, and brooding; but he was not. His spirits seemed&#10;not to age at all&#8212;he was still a playful child, much to the&#10;discomfiture of his fellow-apes. They could not understand him or&#10;his ways, for with maturity they quickly forgot their youth and its&#10;pastimes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Nor could Tarzan quite understand them. It seemed strange to him&#10;that a few moons since, he had roped Taug about an ankle and&#10;dragged him screaming through the tall jungle grasses, and then&#10;rolled and tumbled in good-natured mimic battle when the young ape&#10;had freed himself, and that today when he had come up behind the&#10;same Taug and pulled him over backward upon the turf, instead of&#10;the playful young ape, a great, snarling beast had whirled and&#10;leaped for his throat.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Easily Tarzan eluded the charge and quickly Taug&#39;s anger&#10;vanished, though it was not replaced with playfulness; yet the&#10;ape-man realized that Taug was not amused nor was he amusing. The&#10;big bull ape seemed to have lost whatever sense of humor he once&#10;may have possessed. With a grunt of disappointment, young Lord&#10;Greystoke turned to other fields of endeavor. A strand of black&#10;hair fell across one eye. He brushed it aside with the palm of a&#10;hand and a toss of his head. It suggested something to do, so he&#10;sought his quiver which lay cached in the hollow bole of a&#10;lightning-riven tree. Removing the arrows he turned the quiver&#10;upside down, emptying upon the ground the contents of its bottom&#8212;&#10;his few treasures. Among them was a flat bit of stone and a shell&#10;which he had picked up from the beach near his father&#39;s cabin.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With great care he rubbed the edge of the shell back and forth&#10;upon the flat stone until the soft edge was quite fine and sharp.&#10;He worked much as a barber does who hones a razor, and with every&#10;evidence of similar practice; but his proficiency was the result of&#10;years of painstaking effort. Unaided he had worked out a method of&#10;his own for putting an edge upon the shell&#8212;he even tested it with&#10;the ball of his thumb&#8212; and when it met with his approval he grasped&#10;a wisp of hair which fell across his eyes, grasped it between the&#10;thumb and first finger of his left hand and sawed upon it with the&#10;sharpened shell until it was severed. All around his head he went&#10;until his black shock was rudely bobbed with a ragged bang in&#10;front. For the appearance of it he cared nothing; but in the matter&#10;of safety and comfort it meant everything. A lock of hair falling&#10;in one&#39;s eyes at the wrong moment might mean all the difference&#10;between life and death, while straggly strands, hanging down one&#39;s&#10;back were most uncomfortable, especially when wet with dew or rain&#10;or perspiration.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As Tarzan labored at his tonsorial task, his active mind was&#10;busy with many things. He recalled his recent battle with Bolgani,&#10;the gorilla, the wounds of which were but just healed. He pondered&#10;the strange sleep adventures of his first dreams, and he smiled at&#10;the painful outcome of his last practical joke upon the tribe,&#10;when, dressed in the hide of Numa, the lion, he had come roaring&#10;upon them, only to be leaped upon and almost killed by the great&#10;bulls whom he had taught how to defend themselves from an attack of&#10;their ancient enemy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;His hair lopped off to his entire satisfaction, and seeing no&#10;possibility of pleasure in the company of the tribe, Tarzan swung&#10;leisurely into the trees and set off in the direction of his cabin;&#10;but when part way there his attention was attracted by a strong&#10;scent spoor coming from the north. It was the scent of the&#10;Gomangani.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Curiosity, that best-developed, common heritage of man and ape,&#10;always prompted Tarzan to investigate where the Gomangani were&#10;concerned. There was that about them which aroused his imagination.&#10;Possibly it was because of the diversity of their activities and&#10;interests. The apes lived to eat and sleep and propagate. The same&#10;was true of all the other denizens of the jungle, save the&#10;Gomangani.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;These black fellows danced and sang, scratched around in the&#10;earth from which they had cleared the trees and underbrush; they&#10;watched things grow, and when they had ripened, they cut them down&#10;and put them in straw-thatched huts. They made bows and spears and&#10;arrows, poison, cooking pots, things of metal to wear around their&#10;arms and legs. If it hadn&#39;t been for their black faces, their&#10;hideously disfigured features, and the fact that one of them had&#10;slain Kala, Tarzan might have wished to be one of them. At least he&#10;sometimes thought so, but always at the thought there rose within&#10;him a strange revulsion of feeling, which he could not interpret or&#10;understand&#8212;he simply knew that he hated the Gomangani, and that he&#10;would rather be Histah, the snake, than one of these.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But their ways were interesting, and Tarzan never tired of&#10;spying upon them. and from them he learned much more than he&#10;realized, though always his principal thought was of some new way&#10;in which he could render their lives miserable. The baiting of the&#10;blacks was Tarzan&#39;s chief divertissement.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan realized now that the blacks were very near and that&#10;there were many of them, so he went silently and with great&#10;caution. Noiselessly he moved through the lush grasses of the open&#10;spaces, and where the forest was dense, swung from one swaying&#10;branch to another, or leaped lightly over tangled masses of fallen&#10;trees where there was no way through the lower terraces, and the&#10;ground was choked and impassable.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And so presently he came within sight of the black warriors of&#10;Mbonga, the chief. They were engaged in a pursuit with which Tarzan&#10;was more or less familiar, having watched them at it upon other&#10;occasions. They were placing and baiting a trap for Numa, the lion.&#10;In a cage upon wheels they were tying a kid, so fastening it that&#10;when Numa seized the unfortunate creature, the door of the cage&#10;would drop behind him, making him a prisoner.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;These things the blacks had learned in their old home, before&#10;they escaped through the untracked jungle to their new village.&#10;Formerly they had dwelt in the Belgian Congo until the cruelties of&#10;their heartless oppressors had driven them to seek the safety of&#10;unexplored solitudes beyond the boundaries of Leopold&#39;s domain.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In their old life they often had trapped animals for the agents&#10;of European dealers, and had learned from them certain tricks, such&#10;as this one, which permitted them to capture even Numa without&#10;injuring him, and to transport him in safety and with comparative&#10;ease to their village.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;No longer was there a white market for their savage wares; but&#10;there was still a sufficient incentive for the taking of&#10;Numa&#8212;alive. First was the necessity for ridding the jungle of&#10;man-eaters, and it was only after depredations by these grim and&#10;terrible scourges that a lion hunt was organized. Secondarily was&#10;the excuse for an orgy of celebration was the hunt successful, and&#10;the fact that such fetes were rendered doubly pleasurable by the&#10;presence of a live creature that might be put to death by&#10;torture.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan had witnessed these cruel rites in the past. Being&#10;himself more savage than the savage warriors of the Gomangani, he&#10;was not so shocked by the cruelty of them as he should have been,&#10;yet they did shock him. He could not understand the strange feeling&#10;of revulsion which possessed him at such times. He had no love for&#10;Numa, the lion, yet he bristled with rage when the blacks inflicted&#10;upon his enemy such indignities and cruelties as only the mind of&#10;the one creature molded in the image of God can conceive.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Upon two occasions he had freed Numa from the trap before the&#10;blacks had returned to discover the success or failure of their&#10;venture. He would do the same today&#8212;that he decided immediately he&#10;realized the nature of their intentions.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Leaving the trap in the center of a broad elephant trail near&#10;the drinking hole, the warriors turned back toward their village.&#10;On the morrow they would come again. Tarzan looked after them, upon&#10;his lips an unconscious sneer&#8212;the heritage of unguessed caste. He&#10;saw them file along the broad trail, beneath the overhanging&#10;verdure of leafy branch and looped and festooned creepers, brushing&#10;ebon shoulders against gorgeous blooms which inscrutable Nature has&#10;seen fit to lavish most profusely farthest from the eye of man.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As Tarzan watched, through narrowed lids, the last of the&#10;warriors disappear beyond a turn in the trail, his expression&#10;altered to the urge of a newborn thought. A slow, grim smile&#10;touched his lips. He looked down upon the frightened, bleating kid,&#10;advertising, in its fear and its innocence, its presence and its&#10;helplessness.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Dropping to the ground, Tarzan approached the trap and entered.&#10;Without disturbing the fiber cord, which was adjusted to drop the&#10;door at the proper time, he loosened the living bait, tucked it&#10;under an arm and stepped out of the cage.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With his hunting knife he quieted the frightened animal,&#10;severing its jugular; then he dragged it, bleeding, along the trail&#10;down to the drinking hole, the half smile persisting upon his&#10;ordinarily grave face. At the water&#39;s edge the ape-man stooped and&#10;with hunting knife and quick strong fingers deftly removed the dead&#10;kid&#39;s viscera. Scraping a hole in the mud, he buried these parts&#10;which he did not eat, and swinging the body to his shoulder took to&#10;the trees.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For a short distance he pursued his way in the wake of the black&#10;warriors, coming down presently to bury the meat of his kill where&#10;it would be safe from the depredations of Dango, the hyena, or the&#10;other meat-eating beasts and birds of the jungle. He was hungry.&#10;Had he been all beast he would have eaten; but his man-mind could&#10;entertain urges even more potent than those of the belly, and now&#10;he was concerned with an idea which kept a smile upon his lips and&#10;his eyes sparkling in anticipation. An idea, it was, which&#10;permitted him to forget that he was hungry.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The meat safely cached, Tarzan trotted along the elephant trail&#10;after the Gomangani. Two or three miles from the cage he overtook&#10;them and then he swung into the trees and followed above and behind&#10;them&#8212;waiting his chance.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Among the blacks was Rabba Kega, the witch-doctor. Tarzan hated&#10;them all; but Rabba Kega he especially hated. As the blacks filed&#10;along the winding path, Rabba Kega, being lazy, dropped behind.&#10;This Tarzan noted, and it filled him with satisfaction&#8212;his being&#10;radiated a grim and terrible content. Like an angel of death he&#10;hovered above the unsuspecting black.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Rabba Kega, knowing that the village was but a short distance&#10;ahead, sat down to rest. Rest well, O Rabba Kega! It is thy last&#10;opportunity.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan crept stealthily among the branches of the tree above the&#10;well-fed, self-satisfied witch-doctor. He made no noise that the&#10;dull ears of man could hear above the soughing of the gentle jungle&#10;breeze among the undulating foliage of the upper terraces, and when&#10;he came close above the black man he halted, well concealed by&#10;leafy branch and heavy creeper.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Rabba Kega sat with his back against the bole of a tree, facing&#10;Tarzan. The position was not such as the waiting beast of prey&#10;desired, and so, with the infinite patience of the wild hunter, the&#10;ape-man crouched motionless and silent as a graven image until the&#10;fruit should be ripe for the plucking. A poisonous insect buzzed&#10;angrily out of space. It loitered, circling, close to Tarzan&#39;s&#10;face. The ape-man saw and recognized it. The virus of its sting&#10;spelled death for lesser things than he&#8212;for him it would mean days&#10;of anguish. He did not move. His glittering eyes remained fixed&#10;upon Rabba Kega after acknowledging the presence of the winged&#10;torture by a single glance. He heard and followed the movements of&#10;the insect with his keen ears, and then he felt it alight upon his&#10;forehead. No muscle twitched, for the muscles of such as he are the&#10;servants of the brain. Down across his face crept the horrid&#10;thing&#8212;over nose and lips and chin. Upon his throat it paused, and&#10;turning, retraced its steps. Tarzan watched Rabba Kega. Now not&#10;even his eyes moved. So motionless he crouched that only death&#10;might counterpart his movelessness. The insect crawled upward over&#10;the nut-brown cheek and stopped with its antennae brushing the&#10;lashes of his lower lid. You or I would have started back, closing&#10;our eyes and striking at the thing; but you and I are the slaves,&#10;not the masters of our nerves. Had the thing crawled upon the&#10;eyeball of the ape-man, it is believable that he could yet have&#10;remained wide-eyed and rigid; but it did not. For a moment it&#10;loitered there close to the lower lid, then it rose and buzzed&#10;away.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Down toward Rabba Kega it buzzed and the black man heard it, saw&#10;it, struck at it, and was stung upon the cheek before he killed it.&#10;Then he rose with a howl of pain and anger, and as he turned up the&#10;trail toward the village of Mbonga, the chief, his broad, black&#10;back was exposed to the silent thing waiting above him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And as Rabba Kega turned, a lithe figure shot outward and&#10;downward from the tree above upon his broad shoulders. The impact&#10;of the springing creature carried Rabba Kega to the ground. He felt&#10;strong jaws close upon his neck, and when he tried to scream, steel&#10;fingers throttled his throat. The powerful black warrior struggled&#10;to free himself; but he was as a child in the grip of his&#10;adversary.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Presently Tarzan released his grip upon the other&#39;s throat; but&#10;each time that Rabba Kega essayed a scream, the cruel fingers&#10;choked him painfully. At last the warrior desisted. Then Tarzan&#10;half rose and kneeled upon his victim&#39;s back, and when Rabba Kega&#10;struggled to arise, the ape-man pushed his face down into the dirt&#10;of the trail. With a bit of the rope that had secured the kid,&#10;Tarzan made Rabba Kega&#39;s wrists secure behind his back, then he&#10;rose and jerked his prisoner to his feet, faced him back along the&#10;trail and pushed him on ahead.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Not until he came to his feet did Rabba Kega obtain a square&#10;look at his assailant. When he saw that it was the white devil-god&#10;his heart sank within him and his knees trembled; but as he walked&#10;along the trail ahead of his captor and was neither injured nor&#10;molested his spirits slowly rose, so that he took heart again.&#10;Possibly the devil-god did not intend to kill him after all. Had he&#10;not had little Tibo in his power for days without harming him, and&#10;had he not spared Momaya, Tibo&#39;s mother, when he easily might have&#10;slain her?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And then they came upon the cage which Rabba Kega, with the&#10;other black warriors of the village of Mbonga, the chief, had&#10;placed and baited for Numa. Rabba Kega saw that the bait was gone,&#10;though there was no lion within the cage, nor was the door dropped.&#10;He saw and he was filled with wonder not unmixed with apprehension.&#10;It entered his dull brain that in some way this combination of&#10;circumstances had a connection with his presence there as the&#10;prisoner of the white devil-god.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Nor was he wrong. Tarzan pushed him roughly into the cage, and&#10;in another moment Rabba Kega understood. Cold sweat broke from&#10;every pore of his body&#8212;he trembled as with ague&#8212;for the ape-man was&#10;binding him securely in the very spot the kid had previously&#10;occupied. The witch-doctor pleaded, first for his life, and then&#10;for a death less cruel; but he might as well have saved his pleas&#10;for Numa, since already they were directed toward a wild beast who&#10;understood no word of what he said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But his constant jabbering not only annoyed Tarzan, who worked&#10;in silence, but suggested that later the black might raise his&#10;voice in cries for succor, so he stepped out of the cage, gathered&#10;a handful of grass and a small stick and returning, jammed the&#10;grass into Rabba Kega&#39;s mouth, laid the stick crosswise between his&#10;teeth and fastened it there with the thong from Rabba Kega&#39;s loin&#10;cloth. Now could the witch-doctor but roll his eyes and sweat. Thus&#10;Tarzan left him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The ape-man went first to the spot where he had cached the body&#10;of the kid. Digging it up, he ascended into a tree and proceeded to&#10;satisfy his hunger. What remained he again buried; then he swung&#10;away through the trees to the water hole, and going to the spot&#10;where fresh, cold water bubbled from between two rocks, he drank&#10;deeply. The other beasts might wade in and drink stagnant water;&#10;but not Tarzan of the Apes. In such matters he was fastidious. From&#10;his hands he washed every trace of the repugnant scent of the&#10;Gomangani, and from his face the blood of the kid. Rising, he&#10;stretched himself not unlike some huge, lazy cat, climbed into a&#10;near-by tree and fell asleep.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When he awoke it was dark, though a faint luminosity still&#10;tinged the western heavens. A lion moaned and coughed as it strode&#10;through the jungle toward water. It was approaching the drinking&#10;hole. Tarzan grinned sleepily, changed his position and fell asleep&#10;again.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When the blacks of Mbonga, the chief, reached their village they&#10;discovered that Rabba Kega was not among them. When several hours&#10;had elapsed they decided that something had happened to him, and it&#10;was the hope of the majority of the tribe that whatever had&#10;happened to him might prove fatal. They did not love the&#10;witch-doctor. Love and fear seldom are playmates; but a warrior is&#10;a warrior, and so Mbonga organized a searching party. That his own&#10;grief was not unassuagable might have been gathered from the fact&#10;that he remained at home and went to sleep. The young warriors whom&#10;he sent out remained steadfast to their purpose for fully half an&#10;hour, when, unfortunately for Rabba Kega&#8212; upon so slight a thing&#10;may the fate of a man rest&#8212;a honey bird attracted the attention of&#10;the searchers and led them off for the delicious store it&#10;previously had marked down for betrayal, and Rabba Kega&#39;s doom was&#10;sealed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When the searchers returned empty handed, Mbonga was wroth; but&#10;when he saw the great store of honey they brought with them his&#10;rage subsided. Already Tubuto, young, agile and evil-minded, with&#10;face hideously painted, was practicing the black art upon a sick&#10;infant in the fond hope of succeeding to the office and perquisites&#10;of Rabba Kega. Tonight the women of the old witch-doctor would moan&#10;and howl. Tomorrow he would be forgotten. Such is life, such is&#10;fame, such is power&#8212;in the center of the world&#39;s highest&#10;civilization, or in the depths of the black, primeval jungle.&#10;Always, everywhere, man is man, nor has he altered greatly beneath&#10;his veneer since he scurried into a hole between two rocks to&#10;escape the tyrannosaurus six million years ago.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The morning following the disappearance of Rabba Kega, the&#10;warriors set out with Mbonga, the chief, to examine the trap they&#10;had set for Numa. Long before they reached the cage, they heard the&#10;roaring of a great lion and guessed that they had made a successful&#10;bag, so it was with shouts of joy that they approached the spot&#10;where they should find their captive.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Yes! There he was, a great, magnificent specimen&#8212;a huge,&#10;black-maned lion. The warriors were frantic with delight. They&#10;leaped into the air and uttered savage cries&#8212;hoarse victory cries,&#10;and then they came closer, and the cries died upon their lips, and&#10;their eyes went wide so that the whites showed all around their&#10;irises, and their pendulous lower lips drooped with their drooping&#10;jaws. They drew back in terror at the sight within the cage&#8212;the&#10;mauled and mutilated corpse of what had, yesterday, been Rabba&#10;Kega, the witch-doctor.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The captured lion had been too angry and frightened to feed upon&#10;the body of his kill; but he had vented upon it much of his rage,&#10;until it was a frightful thing to behold.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;From his perch in a near-by tree Tarzan of the Apes, Lord&#10;Greystoke, looked down upon the black warriors and grinned. Once&#10;again his self-pride in his ability as a practical joker asserted&#10;itself. It had lain dormant for some time following the painful&#10;mauling he had received that time he leaped among the apes of&#10;Kerchak clothed in the skin of Numa; but this joke was a decided&#10;success.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;After a few moments of terror, the blacks came closer to the&#10;cage, rage taking the place of fear&#8212;rage and curiosity. How had&#10;Rabba Kega happened to be in the cage? Where was the kid? There was&#10;no sign nor remnant of the original bait. They looked closely and&#10;they saw, to their horror, that the corpse of their erstwhile&#10;fellow was bound with the very cord with which they had secured the&#10;kid. Who could have done this thing? They looked at one&#10;another.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tubuto was the first to speak. He had come hopefully out with&#10;the expedition that morning. Somewhere he might find evidence of&#10;the death of Rabba Kega. Now he had found it, and he was the first&#10;to find an explanation.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The white devil-god,&#34; he whispered. &#34;It is the work of the&#10;white devil-god!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;No one contradicted Tubuto, for, indeed, who else could it have&#10;been but the great, hairless ape they all so feared? And so their&#10;hatred of Tarzan increased again with an increased fear of him. And&#10;Tarzan sat in his tree and hugged himself.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;No one there felt sorrow because of the death of Rabba Kega; but&#10;each of the blacks experienced a personal fear of the ingenious&#10;mind which might discover for any of them a death equally horrible&#10;to that which the witch-doctor had suffered. It was a subdued and&#10;thoughtful company which dragged the captive lion along the broad&#10;elephant path back to the village of Mbonga, the chief.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And it was with a sigh of relief that they finally rolled it&#10;into the village and closed the gates behind them. Each had&#10;experienced the sensation of being spied upon from the moment they&#10;left the spot where the trap had been set, though none had seen or&#10;heard aught to give tangible food to his fears.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At the sight of the body within the cage with the lion, the&#10;women and children of the village set up a most frightful&#10;lamentation, working themselves into a joyous hysteria which far&#10;transcended the happy misery derived by their more civilized&#10;prototypes who make a business of dividing their time between the&#10;movies and the neighborhood funerals of friends and&#10;strangers&#8212;especially strangers.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;From a tree overhanging the palisade, Tarzan watched all that&#10;passed within the village. He saw the frenzied women tantalizing&#10;the great lion with sticks and stones. The cruelty of the blacks&#10;toward a captive always induced in Tarzan a feeling of angry&#10;contempt for the Gomangani. Had he attempted to analyze this&#10;feeling he would have found it difficult, for during all his life&#10;he had been accustomed to sights of suffering and cruelty. He,&#10;himself, was cruel. All the beasts of the jungle were cruel; but&#10;the cruelty of the blacks was of a different order. It was the&#10;cruelty of wanton torture of the helpless, while the cruelty of&#10;Tarzan and the other beasts was the cruelty of necessity or of&#10;passion.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Perhaps, had he known it, he might have credited this feeling of&#10;repugnance at the sight of unnecessary suffering to heredity&#8212;to the&#10;germ of British love of fair play which had been bequeathed to him&#10;by his father and his mother; but, of course, he did not know,&#10;since he still believed that his mother had been Kala, the great&#10;ape.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And just in proportion as his anger rose against the Gomangani&#10;his savage sympathy went out to Numa, the lion, for, though Numa&#10;was his lifetime enemy, there was neither bitterness nor contempt&#10;in Tarzan&#39;s sentiments toward him. In the ape-man&#39;s mind,&#10;therefore, the determination formed to thwart the blacks and&#10;liberate the lion; but he must accomplish this in some way which&#10;would cause the Gomangani the greatest chagrin and&#10;discomfiture.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As he squatted there watching the proceeding beneath him, he saw&#10;the warriors seize upon the cage once more and drag it between two&#10;huts. Tarzan knew that it would remain there now until evening, and&#10;that the blacks were planning a feast and orgy in celebration of&#10;their capture. When he saw that two warriors were placed beside the&#10;cage, and that these drove off the women and children and young men&#10;who would have eventually tortured Numa to death, he knew that the&#10;lion would be safe until he was needed for the evening&#39;s&#10;entertainment, when he would be more cruelly and scientifically&#10;tortured for the edification of the entire tribe.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now Tarzan preferred to bait the blacks in as theatric a manner&#10;as his fertile imagination could evolve. He had some half-formed&#10;conception of their superstitious fears and of their especial dread&#10;of night, and so he decided to wait until darkness fell and the&#10;blacks partially worked to hysteria by their dancing and religious&#10;rites before he took any steps toward the freeing of Numa. In the&#10;meantime, he hoped, an idea adequate to the possibilities of the&#10;various factors at hand would occur to him. Nor was it long before&#10;one did.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He had swung off through the jungle to search for food when the&#10;plan came to him. At first it made him smile a little and then look&#10;dubious, for he still retained a vivid memory of the dire results&#10;that had followed the carrying out of a very wonderful idea along&#10;almost identical lines, yet he did not abandon his intention, and a&#10;moment later, food temporarily forgotten, he was swinging through&#10;the middle terraces in rapid flight toward the stamping ground of&#10;the tribe of Kerchak, the great ape.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As was his wont, he alighted in the midst of the little band&#10;without announcing his approach save by a hideous scream just as he&#10;sprang from a branch above them. Fortunate are the apes of Kerchak&#10;that their kind is not subject to heart failure, for the methods of&#10;Tarzan subjected them to one severe shock after another, nor could&#10;they ever accustom themselves to the ape-man&#39;s peculiar style of&#10;humor.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now, when they saw who it was they merely snarled and grumbled&#10;angrily for a moment and then resumed their feeding or their&#10;napping which he had interrupted, and he, having had his little&#10;joke, made his way to the hollow tree where he kept his treasures&#10;hid from the inquisitive eyes and fingers of his fellows and the&#10;mischievous little manus. Here he withdrew a closely rolled&#10;hide&#8212;the hide of Numa with the head on; a clever bit of primitive&#10;curing and mounting, which had once been the property of the&#10;witch-doctor, Rabba Kega, until Tarzan had stolen it from the&#10;village.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With this he made his way back through the jungle toward the&#10;village of the blacks, stopping to hunt and feed upon the way, and,&#10;in the afternoon, even napping for an hour, so that it was already&#10;dusk when he entered the great tree which overhung the palisade and&#10;gave him a view of the entire village. He saw that Numa was still&#10;alive and that the guards were even dozing beside the cage. A lion&#10;is no great novelty to a black man in the lion country, and the&#10;first keen edge of their desire to worry the brute having worn off,&#10;the villagers paid little or no attention to the great cat,&#10;preferring now to await the grand event of the night.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Nor was it long after dark before the festivities commenced. To&#10;the beating of tom-toms, a lone warrior, crouched half doubled,&#10;leaped into the firelight in the center of a great circle of other&#10;warriors, behind whom stood or squatted the women and the children.&#10;The dancer was painted and armed for the hunt and his movements and&#10;gestures suggested the search for the spoor of game. Bending low,&#10;sometimes resting for a moment on one knee, he searched the ground&#10;for signs of the quarry; again he poised, statuesque, listening.&#10;The warrior was young and lithe and graceful; he was full-muscled&#10;and arrow-straight. The firelight glistened upon his ebon body and&#10;brought out into bold relief the grotesque designs painted upon his&#10;face, breasts, and abdomen.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Presently he bent low to the earth, then leaped high in air.&#10;Every line of face and body showed that he had struck the scent.&#10;Immediately he leaped toward the circle of warriors about him,&#10;telling them of his find and summoning them to the hunt. It was all&#10;in pantomime; but so truly done that even Tarzan could follow it&#10;all to the least detail.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He saw the other warriors grasp their hunting spears and leap to&#10;their feet to join in the graceful, stealthy &#34;stalking dance.&#34; It&#10;was very interesting; but Tarzan realized that if he was to carry&#10;his design to a successful conclusion he must act quickly. He had&#10;seen these dances before and knew that after the stalk would come&#10;the game at bay and then the kill, during which Numa would be&#10;surrounded by warriors, and unapproachable.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With the lion&#39;s skin under one arm the ape-man dropped to the&#10;ground in the dense shadows beneath the tree and then circled&#10;behind the huts until he came out directly in the rear of the cage,&#10;in which Numa paced nervously to and fro. The cage was now&#10;unguarded, the two warriors having left it to take their places&#10;among the other dancers.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Behind the cage Tarzan adjusted the lion&#39;s skin about him, just&#10;as he had upon that memorable occasion when the apes of Kerchak,&#10;failing to pierce his disguise, had all but slain him. Then, on&#10;hands and knees, he crept forward, emerged from between the two&#10;huts and stood a few paces back of the dusky audience, whose whole&#10;attention was centered upon the dancers before them.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan saw that the blacks had now worked themselves to a proper&#10;pitch of nervous excitement to be ripe for the lion. In a moment&#10;the ring of spectators would break at a point nearest the caged&#10;lion and the victim would be rolled into the center of the circle.&#10;It was for this moment that Tarzan waited.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At last it came. A signal was given by Mbonga, the chief, at&#10;which the women and children immediately in front of Tarzan rose&#10;and moved to one side, leaving a broad path opening toward the&#10;caged lion. At the same instant Tarzan gave voice to the low,&#10;couching roar of an angry lion and slunk slowly forward through the&#10;open lane toward the frenzied dancers.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A woman saw him first and screamed. Instantly there was a panic&#10;in the immediate vicinity of the ape-man. The strong light from the&#10;fire fell full upon the lion head and the blacks leaped to the&#10;conclusion, as Tarzan had known they would, that their captive had&#10;escaped his cage.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With another roar, Tarzan moved forward. The dancing warriors&#10;paused but an instant. They had been hunting a lion securely housed&#10;within a strong cage, and now that he was at liberty among them, an&#10;entirely different aspect was placed upon the matter. Their nerves&#10;were not attuned to this emergency. The women and children already&#10;had fled to the questionable safety of the nearest huts, and the&#10;warriors were not long in following their example, so that&#10;presently Tarzan was left in sole possession of the village&#10;street.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But not for long. Nor did he wish to be left thus long alone. It&#10;would not comport with his scheme. Presently a head peered forth&#10;from a near-by hut, and then another and another until a score or&#10;more of warriors were looking out upon him, waiting for his next&#10;move&#8212;waiting for the lion to charge or to attempt to escape from&#10;the village.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Their spears were ready in their hands against either a charge&#10;or a bolt for freedom, and then the lion rose erect upon its hind&#10;legs, the tawny skin dropped from it and there stood revealed&#10;before them in the firelight the straight young figure of the white&#10;devil-god.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For an instant the blacks were too astonished to act. They&#10;feared this apparition fully as much as they did Numa, yet they&#10;would gladly have slain the thing could they quickly enough have&#10;gathered together their wits; but fear and superstition and a&#10;natural mental density held them paralyzed while the ape-man&#10;stooped and gathered up the lion skin. They saw him turn then and&#10;walk back into the shadows at the far end of the village. Not until&#10;then did they gain courage to pursue him, and when they had come in&#10;force, with brandished spears and loud war cries, the quarry was&#10;gone.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Not an instant did Tarzan pause in the tree. Throwing the skin&#10;over a branch he leaped again into the village upon the opposite&#10;side of the great bole, and diving into the shadow of a hut, ran&#10;quickly to where lay the caged lion. Springing to the top of the&#10;cage he pulled upon the cord which raised the door, and a moment&#10;later a great lion in the prime of his strength and vigor leaped&#10;out into the village.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The warriors, returning from a futile search for Tarzan, saw him&#10;step into the firelight. Ah! there was the devil-god again, up to&#10;his old trick. Did he think he could twice fool the men of Mbonga,&#10;the chief, the same way in so short a time? They would show him!&#10;For long they had waited for such an opportunity to rid themselves&#10;forever of this fearsome jungle demon. As one they rushed forward&#10;with raised spears.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The women and the children came from the huts to witness the&#10;slaying of the devil-god. The lion turned blazing eyes upon them&#10;and then swung about toward the advancing warriors.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With shouts of savage joy and triumph they came toward him,&#10;menacing him with their spears. The devil-god was theirs!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And then, with a frightful roar, Numa, the lion, charged.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The men of Mbonga, the chief, met Numa with ready spears and&#10;screams of raillery. In a solid mass of muscled ebony they waited&#10;the coming of the devil-god; yet beneath their brave exteriors&#10;lurked a haunting fear that all might not be quite well with&#10;them&#8212;that this strange creature could yet prove invulnerable to&#10;their weapons and inflict upon them full punishment for their&#10;effrontery. The charging lion was all too lifelike&#8212;they saw that in&#10;the brief instant of the charge; but beneath the tawny hide they&#10;knew was hid the soft flesh of the white man, and how could that&#10;withstand the assault of many war spears?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In their forefront stood a huge young warrior in the full&#10;arrogance of his might and his youth. Afraid? Not he! He laughed as&#10;Numa bore down upon him; he laughed and couched his spear, setting&#10;the point for the broad breast. And then the lion was upon him. A&#10;great paw swept away the heavy war spear, splintering it as the&#10;hand of man might splinter a dry twig.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Down went the black, his skull crushed by another blow. And then&#10;the lion was in the midst of the warriors, clawing and tearing to&#10;right and left. Not for long did they stand their ground; but a&#10;dozen men were mauled before the others made good their escape from&#10;those frightful talons and gleaming fangs.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In terror the villagers fled hither and thither. No hut seemed a&#10;sufficiently secure asylum with Numa ranging within the palisade.&#10;From one to another fled the frightened blacks, while in the center&#10;of the village Numa stood glaring and growling above his kills.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At last a tribesman flung wide the gates of the village and&#10;sought safety amid the branches of the forest trees beyond. Like&#10;sheep his fellows followed him, until the lion and his dead&#10;remained alone in the village.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;From the nearer trees the men of Mbonga saw the lion lower his&#10;great head and seize one of his victims by the shoulder and then&#10;with slow and stately tread move down the village street past the&#10;open gates and on into the jungle. They saw and shuddered, and from&#10;another tree Tarzan of the Apes saw and smiled.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A full hour elapsed after the lion had disappeared with his&#10;feast before the blacks ventured down from the trees and returned&#10;to their village. Wide eyes rolled from side to side, and naked&#10;flesh contracted more to the chill of fear than to the chill of the&#10;jungle night.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It was he all the time,&#34; murmured one. &#34;It was the&#10;devil-god.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;He changed himself from a lion to a man, and back again into a&#10;lion,&#34; whispered another.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And he dragged Mweeza into the forest and is eating him,&#34; said&#10;a third, shuddering.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;We are no longer safe here,&#34; wailed a fourth. &#34;Let us take our&#10;belongings and search for another village site far from the haunts&#10;of the wicked devil-god.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But with morning came renewed courage, so that the experiences&#10;of the preceding evening had little other effect than to increase&#10;their fear of Tarzan and strengthen their belief in his&#10;supernatural origin.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And thus waxed the fame and the power of the ape-man in the&#10;mysterious haunts of the savage jungle where he ranged, mightiest&#10;of beasts because of the man-mind which directed his giant muscles&#10;and his flawless courage.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 15, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/943')













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;Tarzan Rescues the Moon'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;THE MOON SHONE down out of a cloudless sky&#8212;a huge, swollen moon&#10;that seemed so close to earth that one might wonder that she did&#10;not brush the crooning tree tops. It was night, and Tarzan was&#10;abroad in the jungle&#8212;Tarzan, the ape-man; mighty fighter, mighty&#10;hunter. Why he swung through the dark shadows of the somber forest&#10;he could not have told you. It was not that he was hungry&#8212;he had&#10;fed well this day, and in a safe cache were the remains of his&#10;kill, ready against the coming of a new appetite. Perhaps it was&#10;the very joy of living that urged him from his arboreal couch to&#10;pit his muscles and his senses against the jungle night, and then,&#10;too, Tarzan always was goaded by an intense desire to know.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The jungle which is presided over by Kudu, the sun, is a very&#10;different jungle from that of Goro, the moon. The diurnal jungle&#10;has its own aspect&#8212;its own lights and shades, its own birds, its&#10;own blooms, its own beasts; its noises are the noises of the day.&#10;The lights and shades of the nocturnal jungle are as different as&#10;one might imagine the lights and shades of another world to differ&#10;from those of our world; its beasts, its blooms, and its birds are&#10;not those of the jungle of Kudu, the sun.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Because of these differences Tarzan loved to investigate the&#10;jungle by night. Not only was the life another life; but it was&#10;richer in numbers and in romance; it was richer in dangers, too,&#10;and to Tarzan of the Apes danger was the spice of life. And the&#10;noises of the jungle night&#8212;the roar of the lion, the scream of the&#10;leopard, the hideous laughter of Dango, the hyena, were music to&#10;the ears of the ape-man.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The soft padding of unseen feet, the rustling of leaves and&#10;grasses to the passage of fierce beasts, the sheen of opalesque&#10;eyes flaming through the dark, the million sounds which proclaimed&#10;the teeming life that one might hear and scent, though seldom see,&#10;constituted the appeal of the nocturnal jungle to Tarzan.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tonight he had swung a wide circle&#8212;toward the east first and&#10;then toward the south, and now he was rounding back again into the&#10;north. His eyes, his ears and his keen nostrils were ever on the&#10;alert. Mingled with the sounds he knew, there were strange&#10;sounds&#8212;weird sounds which he never heard until after Kudu had&#10;sought his lair below the far edge of the big water-sounds which&#10;belonged to Goro, the moon&#8212;and to the mysterious period of Goro&#39;s&#10;supremacy. These sounds often caused Tarzan profound speculation.&#10;They baffled him because he thought that he knew his jungle so well&#10;that there could be nothing within it unfamiliar to him. Sometimes&#10;he thought that as colors and forms appeared to differ by night&#10;from their familiar daylight aspects, so sounds altered with the&#10;passage of Kudu and the coming of Goro, and these thoughts roused&#10;within his brain a vague conjecture that perhaps Goro and Kudu&#10;influenced these changes. And what more natural that eventually he&#10;came to attribute to the sun and the moon personalities as real as&#10;his own? The sun was a living creature and ruled the day. The moon,&#10;endowed with brains and miraculous powers, ruled the night.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Thus functioned the untrained man-mind groping through the dark&#10;night of ignorance for an explanation of the things he could not&#10;touch or smell or hear and of the great, unknown powers of nature&#10;which he could not see.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As Tarzan swung north again upon his wide circle the scent of&#10;the Gomangani came to his nostrils, mixed with the acrid odor of&#10;wood smoke. The ape-man moved quickly in the direction from which&#10;the scent was borne down to him upon the gentle night wind.&#10;Presently the ruddy sheen of a great fire filtered through the&#10;foliage to him ahead, and when Tarzan came to a halt in the trees&#10;near it, he saw a party of half a dozen black warriors huddled&#10;close to the blaze. It was evidently a hunting party from the&#10;village of Mbonga, the chief, caught out in the jungle after dark.&#10;In a rude circle about them they had constructed a thorn boma&#10;which, with the aid of the fire, they apparently hoped would&#10;discourage the advances of the larger carnivora.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;That hope was not conviction was evidenced by the very palpable&#10;terror in which they crouched, wide-eyed and trembling, for already&#10;Numa and Sabor were moaning through the jungle toward them. There&#10;were other creatures, too, in the shadows beyond the firelight.&#10;Tarzan could see their yellow eyes flaming there. The blacks saw&#10;them and shivered. Then one arose and grasping a burning branch&#10;from the fire hurled it at the eyes, which immediately disappeared.&#10;The black sat down again. Tarzan watched and saw that it was&#10;several minutes before the eyes began to reappear in twos and&#10;fours.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then came Numa, the lion, and Sabor, his mate. The other eyes&#10;scattered to right and left before the menacing growls of the great&#10;cats, and then the huge orbs of the man-eaters flamed alone out of&#10;the darkness. Some of the blacks threw themselves upon their faces&#10;and moaned; but he who before had hurled the burning branch now&#10;hurled another straight at the faces of the hungry lions, and they,&#10;too, disappeared as had the lesser lights before them. Tarzan was&#10;much interested. He saw a new reason for the nightly fires&#10;maintained by the blacks&#8212;a reason in addition to those connected&#10;with warmth and light and cooking. The beasts of the jungle feared&#10;fire, and so fire was, in a measure, a protection from them. Tarzan&#10;himself knew a certain awe of fire. Once he had, in investigating&#10;an abandoned fire in the village of the blacks, picked up a live&#10;coal. Since then he had maintained a respectful distance from such&#10;fires as he had seen. One experience had sufficed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For a few minutes after the black hurled the firebrand no eyes&#10;appeared, though Tarzan could hear the soft padding of feet all&#10;about him. Then flashed once more the twin fire spots that marked&#10;the return of the lord of the jungle and a moment later, upon a&#10;slightly lower level, there appeared those of Sabor, his mate.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For some time they remained fixed and unwavering&#8212;a constellation&#10;of fierce stars in the jungle night&#8212;then the male lion advanced&#10;slowly toward the boma, where all but a single black still crouched&#10;in trembling terror. When this lone guardian saw that Numa was&#10;again approaching, he threw another firebrand, and, as before, Numa&#10;retreated and with him Sabor, the lioness; but not so far, this&#10;time, nor for so long. Almost instantly they turned and began&#10;circling the boma, their eyes turning constantly toward the&#10;firelight, while low, throaty growls evidenced their increasing&#10;displeasure. Beyond the lions glowed the flaming eyes of the lesser&#10;satellites, until the black jungle was shot all around the black&#10;men&#39;s camp with little spots of fire.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Again and again the black warrior hurled his puny brands at the&#10;two big cats; but Tarzan noticed that Numa paid little or no&#10;attention to them after the first few retreats. The ape-man knew by&#10;Numa&#39;s voice that the lion was hungry and surmised that he had made&#10;up his mind to feed upon a Gomangani; but would he dare a closer&#10;approach to the dreaded flames?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Even as the thought was passing in Tarzan&#39;s mind, Numa stopped&#10;his restless pacing and faced the boma. For a moment he stood&#10;motionless, except for the quick, nervous upcurving of his tail,&#10;then he walked deliberately forward, while Sabor moved restlessly&#10;to and fro where he had left her. The black man called to his&#10;comrades that the lion was coming, but they were too far gone in&#10;fear to do more than huddle closer together and moan more loudly&#10;than before.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Seizing a blazing branch the man cast it straight into the face&#10;of the lion. There was an angry roar, followed by a swift charge.&#10;With a single bound the savage beast cleared the boma wall as, with&#10;almost equal agility, the warrior cleared it upon the opposite side&#10;and, chancing the dangers lurking in the darkness, bolted for the&#10;nearest tree.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Numa was out of the boma almost as soon as he was inside it; but&#10;as he went back over the low thorn wall, he took a screaming negro&#10;with him. Dragging his victim along the ground he walked back&#10;toward Sabor, the lioness, who joined him, and the two continued&#10;into the blackness, their savage growls mingling with the piercing&#10;shrieks of the doomed and terrified man.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At a little distance from the blaze the lions halted, there&#10;ensued a short succession of unusually vicious growls and roars,&#10;during which the cries and moans of the black man&#10;ceased&#8212;forever.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Presently Numa reappeared in the firelight. He made a second&#10;trip into the boma and the former grisly tragedy was reenacted with&#10;another howling victim.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan rose and stretched lazily. The entertainment was&#10;beginning to bore him. He yawned and turned upon his way toward the&#10;clearing where the tribe would be sleeping in the encircling&#10;trees.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Yet even when he had found his familiar crotch and curled&#10;himself for slumber, he felt no desire to sleep. For a long time he&#10;lay awake thinking and dreaming. He looked up into the heavens and&#10;watched the moon and the stars. He wondered what they were and what&#10;power kept them from falling. His was an inquisitive mind. Always&#10;he had been full of questions concerning all that passed around&#10;him; but there never had been one to answer his questions. In&#10;childhood he had wanted to KNOW, and, denied almost all knowledge,&#10;he still, in manhood, was filled with the great, unsatisfied&#10;curiosity of a child.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He was never quite content merely to perceive that things&#10;happened&#8212;he desired to know WHY they happened. He wanted to know&#10;what made things go. The secret of life interested him immensely.&#10;The miracle of death he could not quite fathom. Upon innumerable&#10;occasions he had investigated the internal mechanism of his kills,&#10;and once or twice he had opened the chest cavity of victims in time&#10;to see the heart still pumping.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He had learned from experience that a knife thrust through this&#10;organ brought immediate death nine times out of ten, while he might&#10;stab an antagonist innumerable times in other places without even&#10;disabling him. And so he had come to think of the heart, or, as he&#10;called it, &#34;the red thing that breathes,&#34; as the seat and origin of&#10;life.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The brain and its functionings he did not comprehend at all.&#10;That his sense perceptions were transmitted to his brain and there&#10;translated, classified, and labeled was something quite beyond him.&#10;He thought that his fingers knew when they touched something, that&#10;his eyes knew when they saw, his ears when they heard, his nose&#10;when it scented.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He considered his throat, epidermis, and the hairs of his head&#10;as the three principal seats of emotion. When Kala had been slain a&#10;peculiar choking sensation had possessed his throat; contact with&#10;Histah, the snake, imparted an unpleasant sensation to the skin of&#10;his whole body; while the approach of an enemy made the hairs on&#10;his scalp stand erect.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Imagine, if you can, a child filled with the wonders of nature,&#10;bursting with queries and surrounded only by beasts of the jungle&#10;to whom his questionings were as strange as Sanskrit would have&#10;been. If he asked Gunto what made it rain, the big old ape would&#10;but gaze at him in dumb astonishment for an instant and then return&#10;to his interesting and edifying search for fleas; and when he&#10;questioned Mumga, who was very old and should have been very wise,&#10;but wasn&#39;t, as to the reason for the closing of certain flowers&#10;after Kudu had deserted the sky, and the opening of others during&#10;the night, he was surprised to discover that Mumga had never&#10;noticed these interesting facts, though she could tell to an inch&#10;just where the fattest grubworm should be hiding.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;To Tarzan these things were wonders. They appealed to his&#10;intellect and to his imagination. He saw the flowers close and&#10;open; he saw certain blooms which turned their faces always toward&#10;the sun; he saw leaves which moved when there was no breeze; he saw&#10;vines crawl like living things up the boles and over the branches&#10;of great trees; and to Tarzan of the Apes the flowers and the vines&#10;and the trees were living creatures. He often talked to them, as he&#10;talked to Goro, the moon, and Kudu, the sun, and always was he&#10;disappointed that they did not reply. He asked them questions; but&#10;they could not answer, though he knew that the whispering of the&#10;leaves was the language of the leaves&#8212;they talked with one&#10;another.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The wind he attributed to the trees and grasses. He thought that&#10;they swayed themselves to and fro, creating the wind. In no other&#10;way could he account for this phenomenon. The rain he finally&#10;attributed to the stars, the moon, and the sun; but his hypothesis&#10;was entirely unlovely and unpoetical.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tonight as Tarzan lay thinking, there sprang to his fertile&#10;imagination an explanation of the stars and the moon. He became&#10;quite excited about it. Taug was sleeping in a nearby crotch.&#10;Tarzan swung over beside him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Taug!&#34; he cried. Instantly the great bull was awake and&#10;bristling, sensing danger from the nocturnal summons. &#34;Look, Taug!&#34;&#10;exclaimed Tarzan, pointing toward the stars. &#34;See the eyes of Numa&#10;and Sabor, of Sheeta and Dango. They wait around Goro to leap in&#10;upon him for their kill. See the eyes and the nose and the mouth of&#10;Goro. And the light that shines upon his face is the light of the&#10;great fire he has built to frighten away Numa and Sabor and Dango&#10;and Sheeta.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;All about him are the eyes, Taug, you can see them! But they do&#10;not come very close to the fire&#8212;there are few eyes close to Goro.&#10;They fear the fire! It is the fire that saves Goro from Numa. Do&#10;you see them, Taug? Some night Numa will be very hungry and very&#10;angry&#8212;then he will leap over the thorn bushes which encircle Goro&#10;and we will have no more light after Kudu seeks his lair&#8212;the night&#10;will be black with the blackness that comes when Goro is lazy and&#10;sleeps late into the night, or when he wanders through the skies by&#10;day, forgetting the jungle and its people.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Taug looked stupidly at the heavens and then at Tarzan. A meteor&#10;fell, blazing a flaming way through the sky.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Look!&#34; cried Tarzan. &#34;Goro has thrown a burning branch at&#10;Numa.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Taug grumbled. &#34;Numa is down below,&#34; he said. &#34;Numa does not&#10;hunt above the trees.&#34; But he looked curiously and a little&#10;fearfully at the bright stars above him, as though he saw them for&#10;the first time, and doubtless it was the first time that Taug ever&#10;had seen the stars, though they had been in the sky above him every&#10;night of his life. To Taug they were as the gorgeous jungle&#10;blooms&#8212;he could not eat them and so he ignored them.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Taug fidgeted and was nervous. For a long time he lay sleepless,&#10;watching the stars&#8212;the flaming eyes of the beasts of prey&#10;surrounding Goro, the moon&#8212;Goro, by whose light the apes danced to&#10;the beating of their earthen drums. If Goro should be eaten by Numa&#10;there could be no more Dum-Dums. Taug was overwhelmed by the&#10;thought. He glanced at Tarzan half fearfully. Why was his friend so&#10;different from the others of the tribe? No one else whom Taug ever&#10;had known had had such queer thoughts as Tarzan. The ape scratched&#10;his head and wondered, dimly, if Tarzan was a safe companion, and&#10;then he recalled slowly, and by a laborious mental process, that&#10;Tarzan had served him better than any other of the apes, even the&#10;strong and wise bulls of the tribe.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan it was who had freed him from the blacks at the very time&#10;that Taug had thought Tarzan wanted Teeka. It was Tarzan who had&#10;saved Taug&#39;s little balu from death. It was Tarzan who had&#10;conceived and carried out the plan to pursue Teeka&#39;s abductor and&#10;rescue the stolen one. Tarzan had fought and bled in Taug&#39;s service&#10;so many times that Taug, although only a brutal ape, had had&#10;impressed upon his mind a fierce loyalty which nothing now could&#10;swerve&#8212;his friendship for Tarzan had become a habit, a tradition&#10;almost, which would endure while Taug endured. He never showed any&#10;outward demonstration of affection&#8212;he growled at Tarzan as he&#10;growled at the other bulls who came too close while he was&#10;feeding&#8212;but he would have died for Tarzan. He knew it and Tarzan&#10;knew it; but of such things apes do not speak&#8212;their vocabulary, for&#10;the finer instincts, consisting more of actions than words. But now&#10;Taug was worried, and he fell asleep again still thinking of the&#10;strange words of his fellow.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The following day he thought of them again, and without any&#10;intention of disloyalty he mentioned to Gunto what Tarzan had&#10;suggested about the eyes surrounding Goro, and the possibility that&#10;sooner or later Numa would charge the moon and devour him. To the&#10;apes all large things in nature are male, and so Goro, being the&#10;largest creature in the heavens by night, was, to them, a bull.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Gunto bit a sliver from a horny finger and recalled the fact&#10;that Tarzan had once said that the trees talked to one another, and&#10;Gozan recounted having seen the ape-man dancing alone in the&#10;moonlight with Sheeta, the panther. They did not know that Tarzan&#10;had roped the savage beast and tied him to a tree before he came to&#10;earth and leaped about before the rearing cat, to tantalize&#10;him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Others told of seeing Tarzan ride upon the back of Tantor, the&#10;elephant; of his bringing the black boy, Tibo, to the tribe, and of&#10;mysterious things with which he communed in the strange lair by the&#10;sea. They had never understood his books, and after he had shown&#10;them to one or two of the tribe and discovered that even the&#10;pictures carried no impression to their brains, he had&#10;desisted.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Tarzan is not an ape,&#34; said Gunto. &#34;He will bring Numa to eat&#10;us, as he is bringing him to eat Goro. We should kill him.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Immediately Taug bristled. Kill Tarzan! &#34;First you will kill&#10;Taug,&#34; he said, and lumbered away to search for food.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But others joined the plotters. They thought of many things&#10;which Tarzan had done&#8212;things which apes did not do and could not&#10;understand. Again Gunto voiced the opinion that the Tarmangani, the&#10;white ape, should be slain, and the others, filled with terror&#10;about the stories they had heard, and thinking Tarzan was planning&#10;to slay Goro, greeted the proposal with growls of accord.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Among them was Teeka, listening with all her ears; but her voice&#10;was not raised in furtherance of the plan. Instead she bristled,&#10;showing her fangs, and afterward she went away in search of Tarzan;&#10;but she could not find him, as he was roaming far afield in search&#10;of meat. She found Taug, though, and told him what the others were&#10;planning, and the great bull stamped upon the ground and roared.&#10;His bloodshot eyes blazed with wrath, his upper lip curled up to&#10;expose his fighting fangs, and the hair upon his spine stood erect,&#10;and then a rodent scurried across the open and Taug sprang to seize&#10;it. In an instant he seemed to have forgotten his rage against the&#10;enemies of his friend; but such is the mind of an ape.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Several miles away Tarzan of the Apes lolled upon the broad head&#10;of Tantor, the elephant. He scratched beneath the great ears with&#10;the point of a sharp stick, and he talked to the huge pachyderm of&#10;everything which filled his black-thatched head. Little, or&#10;nothing, of what he said did Tantor understand; but Tantor is a&#10;good listener. Swaying from side to side he stood there enjoying&#10;the companionship of his friend, the friend he loved, and absorbing&#10;the delicious sensations of the scratching.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Numa, the lion, caught the scent of man, and warily stalked it&#10;until he came within sight of his prey upon the head of the mighty&#10;tusker; then he turned, growling and muttering, away in search of&#10;more propitious hunting grounds.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The elephant caught the scent of the lion, borne to him by an&#10;eddying breeze, and lifting his trunk trumpeted loudly. Tarzan&#10;stretched back luxuriously, lying supine at full length along the&#10;rough hide. Flies swarmed about his face; but with a leafy branch&#10;torn from a tree he lazily brushed them away.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Tantor,&#34; he said, &#34;it is good to be alive. It is good to lie in&#10;the cool shadows. It is good to look upon the green trees and the&#10;bright colors of the flowers&#8212;upon everything which Bulamutumumo has&#10;put here for us. He is very good to us, Tantor; He has given you&#10;tender leaves and bark, and rich grasses to eat; to me He has given&#10;Bara and Horta and Pisah, the fruits and the nuts and the roots. He&#10;provides for each the food that each likes best. All that He asks&#10;is that we be strong enough or cunning enough to go forth and take&#10;it. Yes, Tantor, it is good to live. I should hate to die.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tantor made a little sound in his throat and curled his trunk&#10;upward that he might caress the ape-man&#39;s cheek with the finger at&#10;its tip.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Tantor,&#34; said Tarzan presently, &#34;turn and feed in the direction&#10;of the tribe of Kerchak, the great ape, that Tarzan may ride home&#10;upon your head without walking.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The tusker turned and moved slowly off along a broad,&#10;tree-arched trail, pausing occasionally to pluck a tender branch,&#10;or strip the edible bark from an adjacent tree. Tarzan sprawled&#10;face downward upon the beast&#39;s head and back, his legs hanging on&#10;either side, his head supported by his open palms, his elbows&#10;resting on the broad cranium. And thus they made their leisurely&#10;way toward the gathering place of the tribe.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Just before they arrived at the clearing from the north there&#10;reached it from the south another figure&#8212;that of a well-knit black&#10;warrior, who stepped cautiously through the jungle, every sense&#10;upon the alert against the many dangers which might lurk anywhere&#10;along the way. Yet he passed beneath the southernmost sentry that&#10;was posted in a great tree commanding the trail from the south. The&#10;ape permitted the Gomangani to pass unmolested, for he saw that he&#10;was alone; but the moment that the warrior had entered the clearing&#10;a loud &#34;Kreeg-ah!&#34; rang out from behind him, immediately followed&#10;by a chorus of replies from different directions, as the great&#10;bulls crashed through the trees in answer to the summons of their&#10;fellow.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The black man halted at the first cry and looked about him. He&#10;could see nothing, but he knew the voice of the hairy tree men whom&#10;he and his kind feared, not alone because of the strength and&#10;ferocity of the savage beings, but as well through a superstitious&#10;terror engendered by the manlike appearance of the apes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But Bulabantu was no coward. He heard the apes all about him; he&#10;knew that escape was probably impossible, so he stood his ground,&#10;his spear ready in his hand and a war cry trembling on his lips. He&#10;would sell his life dearly, would Bulabantu, under-chief of the&#10;village of Mbonga, the chief.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan and Tantor were but a short distance away when the first&#10;cry of the sentry rang out through the quiet jungle. Like a flash&#10;the ape-man leaped from the elephant&#39;s back to a near-by tree and&#10;was swinging rapidly in the direction of the clearing before the&#10;echoes of the first &#34;Kreeg-ah&#34; had died away. When he arrived he&#10;saw a dozen bulls circling a single Gomangani. With a&#10;blood-curdling scream Tarzan sprang to the attack. He hated the&#10;blacks even more than did the apes, and here was an opportunity for&#10;a kill in the open. What had the Gomangani done? Had he slain one&#10;of the tribe?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan asked the nearest ape. No, the Gomangani had harmed none.&#10;Gozan, being on watch, had seen him coming through the forest and&#10;had warned the tribe&#8212;that was all. The ape-man pushed through the&#10;circle of bulls, none of which as yet had worked himself into&#10;sufficient frenzy for a charge, and came where he had a full and&#10;close view of the black. He recognized the man instantly. Only the&#10;night before he had seen him facing the eyes in the dark, while his&#10;fellows groveled in the dirt at his feet, too terrified even to&#10;defend themselves. Here was a brave man, and Tarzan had deep&#10;admiration for bravery. Even his hatred of the blacks was not so&#10;strong a passion as his love of courage. He would have joyed in&#10;battling with a black warrior at almost any time; but this one he&#10;did not wish to kill&#8212;he felt, vaguely, that the man had earned his&#10;life by his brave defense of it on the preceding night, nor did he&#10;fancy the odds that were pitted against the lone warrior.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He turned to the apes. &#34;Go back to your feeding,&#34; he said, &#34;and&#10;let this Gomangani go his way in peace. He has not harmed us, and&#10;last night I saw him fighting Numa and Sabor with fire, alone in&#10;the jungle. He is brave. Why should we kill one who is brave and&#10;who has not attacked us? Let him go.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The apes growled. They were displeased. &#34;Kill the Gomangani!&#34;&#10;cried one.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes.&#34; roared another, &#34;kill the Gomangani and the Tarmangani as&#10;well.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Kill the white ape!&#34; screamed Gozan, &#34;he is no ape at all; but&#10;a Gomangani with his skin off.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Kill Tarzan!&#34; bellowed Gunto. &#34;Kill! Kill! Kill!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The bulls were now indeed working themselves into the frenzy of&#10;slaughter; but against Tarzan rather than the black man. A shaggy&#10;form charged through them, hurling those it came in contact with to&#10;one side as a strong man might scatter children. It was Taug&#8212;great,&#10;savage Taug.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Who says &#39;kill Tarzan&#39;?&#34; he demanded. &#34;Who kills Tarzan must&#10;kill Taug, too. Who can kill Taug? Taug will tear your insides from&#10;you and feed them to Dango.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;We can kill you all,&#34; replied Gunto. &#34;There are many of us and&#10;few of you,&#34; and he was right. Tarzan knew that he was right. Taug&#10;knew it; but neither would admit such a possibility. It is not the&#10;way of bull apes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I am Tarzan,&#34; cried the ape-man. &#34;I am Tarzan. Mighty hunter;&#10;mighty fighter. In all the jungle none so great as Tarzan.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then, one by one, the opposing bulls recounted their virtues and&#10;their prowess. And all the time the combatants came closer and&#10;closer to one another. Thus do the bulls work themselves to the&#10;proper pitch before engaging in battle.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Gunto came, stiff-legged, close to Tarzan and sniffed at him,&#10;with bared fangs. Tarzan rumbled forth a low, menacing growl. They&#10;might repeat these tactics a dozen times; but sooner or later one&#10;bull would close with another and then the whole hideous pack would&#10;be tearing and rending at their prey.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Bulabantu, the black man, had stood wide-eyed in wonder from the&#10;moment he had seen Tarzan approaching through the apes. He had&#10;heard much of this devil-god who ran with the hairy tree people;&#10;but never before had he seen him in full daylight. He knew him well&#10;enough from the description of those who had seen him and from the&#10;glimpses he had had of the marauder upon several occasions when the&#10;ape-man had entered the village of Mbonga, the chief, by night, in&#10;the perpetration of one of his numerous ghastly jokes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Bulabantu could not, of course, understand anything which passed&#10;between Tarzan and the apes; but he saw that the ape-man and one of&#10;the larger bulls were in argument with the others. He saw that&#10;these two were standing with their back toward him and between him&#10;and the balance of the tribe, and he guessed, though it seemed&#10;improbable, that they might be defending him. He knew that Tarzan&#10;had once spared the life of Mbonga, the chief, and that he had&#10;succored Tibo, and Tibo&#39;s mother, Momaya. So it was not impossible&#10;that he would help Bulabantu; but how he could accomplish it&#10;Bulabantu could not guess; nor as a matter of fact could Tarzan,&#10;for the odds against him were too great.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Gunto and the others were slowly forcing Tarzan and Taug back&#10;toward Bulabantu. The ape-man thought of his words with Tantor just&#10;a short time before: &#34;Yes, Tantor, it is good to live. I should&#10;hate to die.&#34; And now he knew that he was about to die, for the&#10;temper of the great bulls was mounting rapidly against him. Always&#10;had many of them hated him, and all were suspicious of him. They&#10;knew he was different. Tarzan knew it too; but he was glad that he&#10;was&#8212;he was a MAN; that he had learned from his picture-books, and&#10;he was very proud of the distinction. Presently, though, he would&#10;be a dead man.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Gunto was preparing to charge. Tarzan knew the signs. He knew&#10;that the balance of the bulls would charge with Gunto. Then it&#10;would soon be over. Something moved among the verdure at the&#10;opposite side of the clearing. Tarzan saw it just as Gunto, with&#10;the terrifying cry of a challenging ape, sprang forward. Tarzan&#10;voiced a peculiar call and then crouched to meet the assault. Taug&#10;crouched, too, and Bulabantu, assured now that these two were&#10;fighting upon his side, couched his spear and sprang between them&#10;to receive the first charge of the enemy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Simultaneously a huge bulk broke into the clearing from the&#10;jungle behind the charging bulls. The trumpeting of a mad tusker&#10;rose shrill above the cries of the anthropoids, as Tantor, the&#10;elephant, dashed swiftly across the clearing to the aid of his&#10;friend.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Gunto never closed upon the ape-man, nor did a fang enter flesh&#10;upon either side. The terrific reverberation of Tantor&#39;s challenge&#10;sent the bulls scurrying to the trees, jabbering and scolding. Taug&#10;raced off with them. Only Tarzan and Bulabantu remained. The latter&#10;stood his ground because he saw that the devil-god did not run, and&#10;because the black had the courage to face a certain and horrible&#10;death beside one who had quite evidently dared death for him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But it was a surprised Gomangani who saw the mighty elephant&#10;come to a sudden halt in front of the ape-man and caress him with&#10;his long, sinuous trunk.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Tarzan turned toward the black man. &#34;Go!&#34; he said in the&#10;language of the apes, and pointed in the direction of the village&#10;of Mbonga. Bulabantu understood the gesture, if not the word, nor&#10;did he lose time in obeying. Tarzan stood watching him until he had&#10;disappeared. He knew that the apes would not follow. Then he said&#10;to the elephant: &#34;Pick me up!&#34; and the tusker swung him lightly to&#10;his head.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Tarzan goes to his lair by the big water,&#34; shouted the ape-man&#10;to the apes in the trees. &#34;All of you are more foolish than Manu,&#10;except Taug and Teeka. Taug and Teeka may come to see Tarzan; but&#10;the others must keep away. Tarzan is done with the tribe of&#10;Kerchak.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He prodded Tantor with a calloused toe and the big beast swung&#10;off across the clearing, the apes watching them until they were&#10;swallowed up by the jungle.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Before the night fell Taug killed Gunto, picking a quarrel with&#10;him over his attack upon Tarzan.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For a moon the tribe saw nothing of Tarzan of the Apes. Many of&#10;them probably never gave him a thought; but there were those who&#10;missed him more than Tarzan imagined. Taug and Teeka often wished&#10;that he was back, and Taug determined a dozen times to go and visit&#10;Tarzan in his seaside lair; but first one thing and then another&#10;interfered.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;One night when Taug lay sleepless looking up at the starry&#10;heavens he recalled the strange things that Tarzan once had&#10;suggested to him&#8212;that the bright spots were the eyes of the&#10;meat-eaters waiting in the dark of the jungle sky to leap upon&#10;Goro, the moon, and devour him. The more he thought about this&#10;matter the more perturbed he became.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And then a strange thing happened. Even as Taug looked at Goro,&#10;he saw a portion of one edge disappear, precisely as though&#10;something was gnawing upon it. Larger and larger became the hole in&#10;the side of Goro. With a scream, Taug leaped to his feet. His&#10;frenzied &#34;Kreeg-ahs!&#34; brought the terrified tribe screaming and&#10;chattering toward him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Look!&#34; cried Taug, pointing at the moon. &#34;Look! It is as Tarzan&#10;said. Numa has sprung through the fires and is devouring Goro. You&#10;called Tarzan names and drove him from the tribe; now see how wise&#10;he was. Let one of you who hated Tarzan go to Goro&#39;s aid. See the&#10;eyes in the dark jungle all about Goro. He is in danger and none&#10;can help him&#8212;none except Tarzan. Soon Goro will be devoured by Numa&#10;and we shall have no more light after Kudu seeks his lair. How&#10;shall we dance the Dum-Dum without the light of Goro?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The apes trembled and whimpered. Any manifestation of the powers&#10;of nature always filled them with terror, for they could not&#10;understand.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Go and bring Tarzan,&#34; cried one, and then they all took up the&#10;cry of &#34;Tarzan!&#34; &#34;Bring Tarzan!&#34; &#34;He will save Goro.&#34; But who was&#10;to travel the dark jungle by night to fetch him?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I will go,&#34; volunteered Taug, and an instant later he was off&#10;through the Stygian gloom toward the little land-locked harbor by&#10;the sea.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And as the tribe waited they watched the slow devouring of the&#10;moon. Already Numa had eaten out a great semicircular piece. At&#10;that rate Goro would be entirely gone before Kudu came again. The&#10;apes trembled at the thought of perpetual darkness by night. They&#10;could not sleep. Restlessly they moved here and there among the&#10;branches of trees, watching Numa of the skies at his deadly feast,&#10;and listening for the coming of Taug with Tarzan.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Goro was nearly gone when the apes heard the sounds of the&#10;approach through the trees of the two they awaited, and presently&#10;Tarzan, followed by Taug, swung into a nearby tree.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The ape-man wasted no time in idle words. In his hand was his&#10;long bow and at his back hung a quiver full of arrows, poisoned&#10;arrows that he had stolen from the village of the blacks; just as&#10;he had stolen the bow. Up into a great tree he clambered, higher&#10;and higher until he stood swaying upon a small limb which bent low&#10;beneath his weight. Here he had a clear and unobstructed view of&#10;the heavens. He saw Goro and the inroads which the hungry Numa had&#10;made into his shining surface.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Raising his face to the moon, Tarzan shrilled forth his hideous&#10;challenge. Faintly and from afar came the roar of an answering&#10;lion. The apes shivered. Numa of the skies had answered Tarzan.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then the ape-man fitted an arrow to his bow, and drawing the&#10;shaft far back, aimed its point at the heart of Numa where he lay&#10;in the heavens devouring Goro. There was a loud twang as the&#10;released bolt shot into the dark heavens. Again and again did&#10;Tarzan of the Apes launch his arrows at Numa, and all the while the&#10;apes of the tribe of Kerchak huddled together in terror.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At last came a cry from Taug. &#34;Look! Look!&#34; he screamed. &#34;Numa&#10;is killed. Tarzan has killed Numa. See! Goro is emerging from the&#10;belly of Numa,&#34; and, sure enough, the moon was gradually emerging&#10;from whatever had devoured her, whether it was Numa, the lion, or&#10;the shadow of the earth; but were you to try to convince an ape of&#10;the tribe of Kerchak that it was aught but Numa who so nearly&#10;devoured Goro that night, or that another than Tarzan preserved the&#10;brilliant god of their savage and mysterious rites from a frightful&#10;death, you would have difficulty&#8212;and a fight on your hands.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And so Tarzan of the Apes came back to the tribe of Kerchak, and&#10;in his coming he took a long stride toward the kingship, which he&#10;ultimately won, for now the apes looked up to him as a superior&#10;being.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In all the tribe there was but one who was at all skeptical&#10;about the plausibility of Tarzan&#39;s remarkable rescue of Goro, and&#10;that one, strange as it may seem, was Tarzan of the Apes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 15, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/943')
