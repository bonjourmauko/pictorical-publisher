I confess&#10;at once that I am a plain, simple man, with no pretensions to&#10;literary style. Still, I do flatter myself that I can tell a story&#10;without exaggerating, and I have therefore decided to give an&#10;unbiased account of the extraordinary events of eight years&#10;ago.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Ravello is a delightful place with a delightful little hotel in&#10;which we met some charming people. There were the two Miss&#10;Robinsons, who had been there for six weeks with Eustace, their&#10;nephew, then a boy of about fourteen. Mr. Sandbach had also been&#10;there some time. He had held a curacy in the north of England,&#10;which he had been compelled to resign on account of ill-health, and&#10;while he was recruiting at Ravello he had taken in hand Eustace&#8217;s&#10;education &#8211; which was then sadly deficient &#8211; and was endeavoring to&#10;fit him for one of our great public schools. Then there was Mr.&#10;Leyland, a would-be artist, and, finally, there was the nice&#10;landlady, Signora Scafetti, and the nice English-speaking waiter,&#10;Emmanuele &#8211; though at the time of which I am speaking Emmanuele was&#10;away, visiting a sick father.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;To this little circle, I, my wife, and my two daughters made, I&#10;venture to think, a not unwelcome addition. But though I liked most&#10;of the company well enough, there were two of them to whom I did&#10;not take at all. They were the artist, Leyland, and the Miss&#10;Robinsons&#8217; nephew, Eustace.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Leyland was simply conceited and odious, and, as those qualities&#10;will be amply illustrated in my narrative, I need not enlarge upon&#10;them here. But Eustace was something besides: he was indescribably&#10;repellent.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I am fond of boys as a rule, and was quite disposed to be&#10;friendly. I and my daughters offered to take him out &#8211; &#8216;No, walking&#10;was such a fag.&#8217; Then I asked him to come and bathe &#8211; &#8216;No, he could&#10;not swim.&#8217;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Every English boy should be able to swim,&#8221; I said, &#8220;I will&#10;teach you myself.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;There, Eustace dear,&#8221; said Miss Robinson; &#8220;here is a chance for&#10;you.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But he said he was afraid of the water! &#8211; a boy afraid! &#8211; and of&#10;course I said no more.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I would not have minded so much if he had been a really studious&#10;boy, but he neither played hard nor worked hard. His favorite&#10;occupations were lounging on the terrace in an easy chair and&#10;loafing along the high road, with his feet shuffling up the dust&#10;and his shoulders stooping forward. Naturally enough, his features&#10;were pale, his chest contracted, and his muscles undeveloped. His&#10;aunts thought him delicate; what he really needed was&#10;discipline.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;That memorable day we all arranged to go for a picnic up in the&#10;chestnut woods &#8211; all, that is, except Janet, who stopped behind to&#10;finish her watercolor of the Cathedral &#8211; not a very successful&#10;attempt, I am afraid.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I wander off into these irrelevant details, because in my mind I&#10;cannot separate them from an account of the day; and it is the same&#10;with the conversation during the picnic: all is imprinted on my&#10;brain together. After a couple of hours&#8217; ascent, we left the&#10;donkeys that had carried the Miss Robinsons and my wife, and all&#10;proceeded on foot to the head of the valley &#8211; Vallone Fontana&#10;Caroso is its proper name, I find.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I have visited a good deal of fine scenery before and since, but&#10;have found little that has pleased me more. The valley ended in a&#10;vast hollow, shaped like a cup, into which radiated ravines from&#10;the precipitous hills around. Both the valley and the ravines and&#10;the ribs of hill that divided the ravines were covered with leafy&#10;chestnut, so that the general appearance was that of a&#10;many-fingered green hand, palm upwards, which was clutching&#10;convulsively to keep us in its grasp. Far down the valley we could&#10;see Ravello and the sea, but that was the only sign of another&#10;world.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Oh, what a perfectly lovely place,&#8221; said my daughter Rose.&#10;&#8220;What a picture it would make!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Mr. Sandbach. &#8220;Many a famous European gallery would&#10;be proud to have a landscape a tithe as beautiful as this upon its&#10;walls.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;On the contrary,&#8221; said Leyland, &#8220;it would make a very poor&#10;picture. Indeed, it is not paintable at all.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;And why is that?&#8221; said Rose, with far more deference than he&#10;deserved.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Look, in the first place,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;how intolerably&#10;straight against the sky is the line of the hill. It would need&#10;breaking up and diversifying. And where we are standing the whole&#10;thing is out of perspective. Besides, all the coloring is&#10;monotonous and crude.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I do not know anything about pictures,&#8221; I put in, &#8220;and I do not&#10;pretend to know: but I know what is beautiful when I see it, and I&#10;am thoroughly content with this.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Indeed, who could help being contented!&#8221; said the elder Miss&#10;Robinson; and Mr. Sandbach said the same.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said Leyland, &#8220;you all confuse the artistic view of Nature&#10;with the photographic.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Poor Rose had brought her camera with her, so I thought this&#10;positively rude. I did not wish any unpleasantness: so I merely&#10;turned away and assisted my wife and Miss Mary Robinson to put out&#10;the lunch &#8211; not a very nice lunch.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Eustace, dear,&#8221; said his aunt, &#8220;come and help us here.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He was in a particularly bad temper that morning. He had, as&#10;usual, not wanted to come, and his aunts had nearly allowed him to&#10;stop at the hotel to vex Janet. But I, with their permission, spoke&#10;to him rather sharply on the subject of exercise; and the result&#10;was that he had come, but was even more taciturn and moody than&#10;usual.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Obedience was not his strong point. He invariably questioned&#10;every command, and only executed it grumbling. I should always&#10;insist on prompt and cheerful obedience, if I had a son.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I&#8217;m &#8211; coming &#8211; Aunt &#8211; Mary,&#8221; he at last replied, and dawdled to&#10;cut a piece of wood to make a whistle, taking care not to arrive&#10;till we had finished.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Well, well, sir!&#8221; said I, &#8220;you stroll in at the end and profit&#10;by our labors.&#8221; He sighed, for he could not endure being chaffed.&#10;Miss Mary, very unwisely, insisted on giving him the wing of the&#10;chicken, in spite of all my attempts to prevent her. I remember&#10;that I had a moment&#8217;s vexation when I thought that, instead of&#10;enjoying the sun, and the air, and the woods, we were all engaged&#10;in wrangling over the diet of a spoilt boy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But, after lunch, he was a little less in evidence. He withdrew&#10;to a tree trunk, and began to loosen the bark from his whistle. I&#10;was thankful to see him employed, for once in a way. We reclined,&#10;and took a dolce far niente.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Those sweet chestnuts of the South are puny striplings compared&#10;with our robust Northerners. But they clothed the contours of the&#10;hills and valleys in a most pleasing way, their veil being only&#10;broken by two clearings, in one which we were sitting.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And because these few trees were cut down, Leyland burst into a&#10;petty indictment of the proprietor.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;All the poetry is going from Nature,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;her lakes and&#10;marshes are drained, her seas banked up, her forests cut down.&#10;Everywhere we see the vulgarity of desolation spreading.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I have had some experience of estates, and answered that cutting&#10;was very necessary for the health of the larger trees. Besides, it&#10;was unreasonable to expect the proprietor to derive no income from&#10;his lands.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;If you take the commercial side of landscape, you may feel&#10;pleasure in the owner&#8217;s activity. But to me the mere thought that a&#10;tree is convertible into cash is disgusting.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I see no reason,&#8221; I observed politely, &#8220;to despise the gifts of&#10;Nature because they are of value.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It did not stop him. &#8220;It is no matter,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;we are all&#10;hopelessly steeped in vulgarity. I do not except myself. It is&#10;through us, and to our shame, that the Nereids have left the waters&#10;and the Oreads the mountains, that the woods no longer give shelter&#10;to Pan.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Pan!&#8221; cried Mr. Sandbach, his mellow voice filling the valley&#10;as if it had been a great green church, &#8220;Pan is dead. That is why&#10;the woods do not shelter him.&#8221; And he began to tell the striking&#10;story of the mariners who were sailing near the coast at the time&#10;of the birth of Christ, and three times heard a loud voice saying:&#10;&#8220;The great God Pan is dead.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Yes. The great God Pan is dead,&#8221; said Leyland. And he abandoned&#10;himself to that mock misery in which artistic people are so fond of&#10;indulging. His cigar went out, and he had to ask me for a&#10;match.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;How very interesting,&#8221; said Rose. &#8220;I do wish I knew some&#10;ancient history.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;It is not worth your notice,&#8221; said Mr. Sandbach. &#8220;Eh,&#10;Eustace?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Eustace was finishing his whistle. He looked up, with the&#10;irritable frown in which his aunts allowed him to indulge, and made&#10;no reply.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The conversation turned to various topics and then died out. It&#10;was a cloudless afternoon in May, and the pale green of the young&#10;chestnut leaves made a pretty contrast with the dark blue of the&#10;sky. We were all sitting at the edge of the small clearing for the&#10;sake of the view, and the shade of the chestnut saplings behind us&#10;was manifestly insufficient. All sounds died away &#8211; at least that&#10;is my account: Miss Robinson says that the clamor of the birds was&#10;the first sign of uneasiness that she discerned. All sounds died&#10;away, except that, far in the distance, I could hear two boughs of&#10;a great chestnut grinding together as the tree swayed. The grinds&#10;grew shorter and shorter, and finally that sound stopped also. As I&#10;looked over the green fingers of the valley, everything was&#10;absolutely motionless and still; and that feeling of suspense which&#10;one so often experiences when Nature is in repose, began to steal&#10;over me.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Suddenly, we were all electrified by the excruciating noise of&#10;Eustace&#8217;s whistle. I never heard any instrument give forth so&#10;ear-splitting and discordant a sound.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Eustace, dear,&#8221; said Miss Mary Robinson, &#8220;you might have&#10;thought of your poor Aunt Julia&#8217;s head.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Leyland, who had apparently been asleep, sat up.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;It is astonishing how blind a boy is to anything that is&#10;elevating or beautiful,&#8221; he observed. &#8220;I should not have thought he&#10;could have found the wherewithal out here to spoil our pleasure&#10;like this.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then the terrible silence fell upon us again. I was now standing&#10;up and watching a catspaw of wind that was running down one of the&#10;ridges opposite, turning the light green to dark as it traveled. A&#10;fanciful feeling of foreboding came over me; so I turned away, to&#10;find to my amazement, that all the others were also on their feet,&#10;watching it too.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It is not possible to describe coherently what happened next:&#10;but I, for one, am not ashamed to confess that, though the fair&#10;blue sky was above me, and the green spring woods beneath me, and&#10;the kindest of friends around me, yet I became terribly frightened,&#10;more frightened than I ever wish to become again, frightened in a&#10;way I never have known either before or after. And in the eyes of&#10;the others, too, I saw blank, expressionless fear, while their&#10;mouths strove in vain to speak and their hands to gesticulate. Yet,&#10;all around us were prosperity, beauty, and peace, and all was&#10;motionless, save the catspaw of wind, now traveling up the ridge on&#10;which we stood.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Who moved first has never been settled. It is enough to say that&#10;in one second we were tearing away along the hillside. Leyland was&#10;in front, then Mr. Sandbach, then my wife. But I only saw for a&#10;brief moment; for I ran across the little clearing and through the&#10;woods and over the undergrowth and the rocks and down the dry&#10;torrent beds into the valley below. The sky might have been black&#10;as I ran, and the trees short grass, and the hillside a level road;&#10;for I saw nothing and heard nothing and felt nothing, since all the&#10;channels of sense and reason were blocked. It was not the spiritual&#10;fear that one has known at other times, but brutal overmastering&#10;physical fear, stopping up the ears, and dropping clouds before the&#10;eyes, and filling the mouth with foul tastes. And it was no&#10;ordinary humiliation that survived; for I had been afraid, not a&#10;man, but as a beast.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;II.&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I cannot describe our finish any better than our start; for our&#10;fear passed away as it had come, without cause. Suddenly I was able&#10;to see, and hear, and cough, and clear my mouth. Looking back, I&#10;saw that the others were stopping too; and, in a short time, we&#10;were all together, though it was long before we could speak, and&#10;longer before we dared to.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;No one was seriously injured. My poor wife had sprained her&#10;ankle, Leyland had torn one of his nails on a tree trunk, and I&#10;myself had scraped and damaged my ear. I never noticed it till I&#10;had stopped.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;We were all silent, searching one another&#8217;s faces. Suddenly Miss&#10;Mary Robinson gave a terrible shriek. &#8220;Oh, merciful heavens! where&#10;is Eustace?&#8221; And then she would have fallen, if Mr. Sandbach had&#10;not caught her.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;We must go back, we must go back at once,&#8221; said my Rose, who&#10;was quite the most collected of the party. &#8220;But I hope &#8211; I feel he&#10;is safe.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Such was the cowardice of Leyland, that he objected. But,&#10;finding himself in a minority, and being afraid of being left&#10;alone, he gave in. Rose and I supported my poor wife, Mr. Sandbach&#10;and Miss Robinson helped Miss Mary, and we returned slowly and&#10;silently, taking forty minutes to ascend the path that we had&#10;descended in ten.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Our conversation was naturally disjointed, as no one wished to&#10;offer an opinion on what had happened. Rose was the most talkative:&#10;she startled us all by saying that she had very nearly stopped&#10;where she was.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Do you mean to say that you weren&#8217;t &#8211; that you didn&#8217;t feel&#10;compelled to go?&#8221; said Mr. Sandbach.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Oh, of course, I did feel frightened&#8221; &#8211; she was the first to&#10;use the word &#8211; &#8220;but I somehow felt that if I could stop on it would&#10;be quite different, that I shouldn&#8217;t be frightened at all, so to&#10;speak.&#8221; Rose never did express herself clearly: still, it is&#10;greatly to her credit that she, the youngest of us, should have&#10;held on so long at that terrible time.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I should have stopped, I do believe,&#8221; she continued, &#8220;if I had&#10;not seen mamma go.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Rose&#8217;s experience comforted us a little about Eustace. But a&#10;feeling of terrible foreboding was on us all, as we painfully&#10;climbed the chestnut-covered slopes and neared the little clearing.&#10;When we reached it our tongues broke loose. There, at the further&#10;side, were the remains of our lunch, and close to them, lying&#10;motionless on his back, was Eustace.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With some presence of mind I at once cried out: &#8220;Hey, you young&#10;monkey! jump up!&#8221; But he made no reply, nor did he answer when his&#10;poor aunts spoke to him. And, to my unspeakable horror, I saw one&#10;of those green lizards dart out from under his shirt-cuff as we&#10;approached.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;We stood watching him as he lay there so silently, and my ears&#10;began to tingle in expectation of the outbursts of lamentations and&#10;tears.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Miss Mary fell on her knees beside him and touched his hand,&#10;which was convulsively entwined in the long grass.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As she did so, he opened his eyes and smiled.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I have often seen that peculiar smile since, both on the&#10;possessor&#8217;s face and on the photographs of him that are beginning&#10;to get into the illustrated papers. But, till then, Eustace had&#10;always worn a peevish, discontented frown; and we were all unused&#10;to this disquieting smile, which always seemed to be without&#10;adequate reason.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;His aunts showered kisses on him, which he did not reciprocate,&#10;and then there was an awkward pause. Eustace seemed so natural and&#10;undisturbed; yet, it he had not had astonishing experiences&#10;himself, he ought to have been all the more astonished at our&#10;extraordinary behavior. My wife, with ready tact, endeavored to&#10;behave as it nothing had happened.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Well, Mr. Eustace,&#8221; she said, sitting down as she spoke, to&#10;ease her foot, &#8220;how have you been amusing yourself since we have&#10;been away?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Thank you, Mrs. Tytler, I have been very happy.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;And where have you been?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Here.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;And lying down all the time, you idle boy?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;No, no! all the time.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;What were you doing before?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Oh; standing or sitting.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Stood and sat doing nothing! Don&#8217;t you know the poem &#8216;Satan&#10;finds some mischief still for &#8211; &#8216;&#8220;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Oh, my dear madam, hush! hush!&#8221; Mr. Sandbach&#8217;s voice broke in;&#10;and my wife, naturally mortified by the interruption, said no more&#10;and moved away. I was surprised to see Rose immediately take her&#10;place, and, with more freedom than she generally displayed, run her&#10;fingers through the boy&#8217;s tousled hair.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Eustace! Eustace!&#8221; she said, hurriedly, &#8220;tell me everything &#8211;&#10;every single thing.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Slowly he sat up &#8211; till then he had lain on his back.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Oh Rose,&#8221; he whispered, and, my curiosity being aroused, I&#10;moved nearer to hear what he was going to say. As I did so, I&#10;caught sight of some goats&#8217; footmarks in the moist earth beneath&#10;the trees.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Apparently you have had a visit from some goats,&#8221; I observed.&#10;&#8220;I had no idea they fed up here.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Eustace laboriously got on to his feet and came to see; and when&#10;he saw the footmarks he lay down and rolled on them, as a dog rolls&#10;in dirt.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;After that there was a grave silence, broken at length by the&#10;solemn speech of Mr. Sandbach.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;My dear friends,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it is best to confess the truth&#10;bravely. I know that what I am going to say now is what you are all&#10;now feeling. The Evil One has been very near us in bodily form.&#10;Time may yet discover some injury that he has wrought among us.&#10;But, at present, for myself at all events, I wish to offer up&#10;thanks for a merciful deliverance.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With that he knelt down, and, as the others knelt, I knelt too,&#10;though I do not believe in the Devil being allowed to assail us in&#10;visible form, as I told Mr. Sandbach afterwards. Eustace came too,&#10;and knelt quietly enough between his aunts after they had beckoned&#10;to him. But when it was over he at once got up, and began hunting&#10;for something.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Why! Someone has cut my whistle in two,&#8221; he said. (I had seen&#10;Leyland with an open knife in his hand &#8211; a superstitious act which&#10;I could hardly approve.)&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Well, it doesn&#8217;t matter,&#8221; he continued.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;And why doesn&#8217;t it matter?&#8221; said Mr. Sandbach, who has ever&#10;since tried to entrap Eustace into an account of that mysterious&#10;hour.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Because I don&#8217;t want it any more.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Why?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At that he smiled; and, as no one seemed to have anything more&#10;to say, I set off as fast as I could through the wood, and hauled&#10;up a donkey to carry my poor wife home. Nothing occurred in my&#10;absence, except that Rose had asked Eustace to tell her what had&#10;happened; and he, this time, had turned away his head, and had not&#10;answered her a single word.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As soon as I returned, we all set off. Eustace walked with&#10;difficulty, almost with pain, so that, when we reached the other&#10;donkeys, his aunts wished him to mount one of them and ride all the&#10;way home. I make it a rule never to interfere between relatives,&#10;but I put my foot down at this. As it turned out, I was perfectly&#10;right, for the healthy exercise, I suppose, began to thaw Eustace&#8217;s&#10;sluggish blood and loosen his stiffened muscles. He stepped out&#10;manfully, for the first time in his life, holding his head up and&#10;taking deep drafts of air into his chest. I observed with&#10;satisfaction to Miss Mary Robinson, that Eustace was at last taking&#10;some pride in his personal appearance.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Sandbach sighed, and said that Eustace must be carefully&#10;watched, for we none of us understood him yet. Miss Mary Robinson&#10;being very much &#8211; over much, I think &#8211; guided by him, sighed&#10;too.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Come, come, Miss Robinson,&#8221; I said, &#8220;there&#8217;s nothing wrong with&#10;Eustace. Our&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;experiences are mysterious, not his. He was astonished at our&#10;sudden departure, that&#8217;s why he was so strange when we returned.&#10;He&#8217;s right enough &#8211; improved, if anything.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;And is the worship of athletics, the cult of insensate&#10;activity, to be counted as an improvement?&#8221; put in Leyland, fixing&#10;a large, sorrowful eye on Eustace, who had stopped to scramble on&#10;to a rock to pick some cyclamen. &#8220;The passionate desire to rend&#10;from Nature the few beauties that have been still left her &#8211; that&#10;is to be counted as an improvement too?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It is mere waste of time to reply to such remarks, especially&#10;when they come from an unsuccessful artist, suffering from a&#10;damaged finger. I changed the conversation by asking what we should&#10;say at the hotel. After some discussion, it was agreed that we&#10;should say nothing, either there or in our letters home.&#10;Importunate truthtelling, which brings only bewilderment and&#10;discomfort to the hearers, is, in my opinion, a mistake; and, after&#10;a long discussion, I managed make Mr. Sandbach acquiesce in my&#10;view.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Eustace did not share in our conversation. He was racing about,&#10;like a real boy, in the wood to the right. A strange feeling of&#10;shame prevented us from openly mentioning our fright to him.&#10;Indeed, it seemed almost reasonable to conclude that it had made&#10;but little impression on him. So it disconcerted us when he bounded&#10;back with an armful of flowering acanthus, calling out:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Do you suppose Gennaro&#8217;ll be there when we get back?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Gennaro was the stop-gap waiter, a clumsy, impertinent&#10;fisher-lad, who had been had up from Minori in the absence of the&#10;nice English-speaking Emmanuele. It was to him that we owed our&#10;scrappy lunch; and I could not conceive why Eustace desired to see&#10;him, unless it was to make mock with him of our behavior.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Yes, of course he will be there,&#8221; said Miss Robinson. &#8220;Why do&#10;you ask, dear?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Oh, I thought I&#8217;d like to see him.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;And why?&#8221; snapped Mr. Sandbach.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Because, because I do, I do; because, because I do.&#8221; He danced&#10;away into the darkening wood to the rhythm of his words.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;This is very extraordinary,&#8221; said Mr. Sandbach. &#8220;Did he like&#10;Gennaro before?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Gennaro has only been here two days,&#8221; said Rose, &#8220;and I know&#10;that they haven&#8217;t spoken to each other a dozen times.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Each time Eustace returned from the wood his spirits were&#10;higher. Once he came whooping down on us as a wild Indian, and&#10;another time he made believe to be a dog . The last time he came&#10;back with a poor dazed hare, too frightened to move, sitting on his&#10;arm. He was getting too uproarious, I thought; and we were all glad&#10;to leave the wood, and start upon the steep staircase path that&#10;leads down into Ravello. It was late and turning dark; and we made&#10;all the speed we could, Eustace scurrying in front of us like a&#10;goat.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Just where the staircase path debouches on the white high road,&#10;the next extraordinary incident of this extraordinary day occurred.&#10;Three old women were standing by the wayside. They, like ourselves,&#10;had come down from the woods, and they were resting their heavy&#10;bundles of fuel on the low parapet of the road. Eustace stopped in&#10;front of them, and, after a moment&#8217;s deliberation, stepped forward&#10;and &#8211; kissed the left-hand one on the cheek!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;My good fellow!&#8221; exclaimed Mr. Sandbach, &#8220;are you quite&#10;crazy?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Eustace said nothing, but offered the old woman some of his&#10;flowers, and then hurried on. I looked back; and the old woman&#8217;s&#10;companions seemed as much astonished at the proceeding as we were.&#10;But she herself had put the flowers in her bosom, and was murmuring&#10;blessings.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;This salutation of the old lady was the first example of&#10;Eustace&#8217;s strange behavior, and we were both surprised and alarmed.&#10;It was useless talking to him, for he either made silly replies, or&#10;else bounded away without replying at all.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He made no reference on the way home to Gennaro, and I hoped&#10;that that was forgotten. But, when we came to the Piazza, in front&#10;of the Cathedral, he screamed out: &#8220;Gennaro! Gennaro!&#8221; at the top&#10;of his voice, and began running up the little alley that led to the&#10;hotel. Sure enough, there was Gennaro at the end of it, with his&#10;arms and legs sticking out of the nice little English-speaking&#10;waiter&#8217;s dress suit, and a dirty fisherman&#8217;s cap on his head &#8211; for,&#10;as the poor landlady truly said, however much she superintended his&#10;toilette, he always managed to introduce something incongruous into&#10;it before he had done.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Eustace sprang to meet him, and leapt right up into his arms,&#10;and put his own arms round his neck. And this in the presence, not&#10;only of us, but also of the landlady, the chambermaid, the&#10;facchino, and of two American ladies who were coming for a few&#10;days&#8217; visit to the little hotel.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I always make a point of behaving pleasantly to Italians,&#10;however little they may deserve it; but this habit of promiscuous&#10;intimacy was perfectly intolerable, and could only lead to&#10;familiarity and mortification for all. Taking Miss Robinson aside,&#10;I asked her permission to speak seriously to Eustace on the subject&#10;of intercourse with social inferiors. She granted it; but I&#10;determined to wait till the absurd boy had calmed down a little&#10;from the excitement of the day. Meanwhile, Gennaro, instead of&#10;attending to the wants of the two new ladies, carried Eustace into&#10;the house, as if it was the most natural thing in the world.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Ho capito,&#8221; I heard him say as he passed me. &#8216;Ho capito&#8217; is the&#10;Italian for &#8216; I have understood&#8217;; but, as Eustace had not spoken to&#10;him, I could not see the force of the remark. It served to increase&#10;our bewilderment, and, by the time we sat down at the dinner table,&#10;our imaginations and our tongues were alike exhausted.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I omit from this account the various comments that were made, as&#10;few of them seem worthy of being recorded. But, for three or four&#10;hours, seven of us were pouring forth our bewilderment in a stream&#10;of appropriate and inappropriate exclamations. Some traced a&#10;connection between our behavior in the afternoon and the behavior&#10;of Eustace now. Others saw no connection at all. Mr. Sandbach still&#10;held to the possibility of infernal influences, and also said that&#10;he ought to have a doctor. Leyland only saw the development of&#10;&#8220;that unspeakable Philistine, the boy.&#8221; Rose maintained, to my&#10;surprise, that everything was excusable; while I began to see that&#10;the young gentleman wanted a sound thrashing. The poor Miss&#10;Robinsons swayed helplessly about between these diverse opinions;&#10;inclining now to careful supervision, now to acquiescence, now to&#10;corporal chastisement, now to Eno&#8217;s Fruit Salt.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Dinner passed off fairly well, though Eustace was terribly&#10;fidgety, Gennaro as usual dropping the knives and spoons, and&#10;hawking and clearing his throat. He only knew a few words of&#10;English, and we were all reduced to Italian for making known our&#10;wants. Eustace, who had picked up a little somehow, asked for some&#10;oranges. To my annoyance, Gennaro, in his answer made use of the&#10;second person singular &#8211; a form only used when addressing those who&#10;are both intimates and equals. Eustace had brought it on himself;&#10;but an impertinence of this kind was an affront to all, and I was&#10;determined to speak, and to speak at once.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When I heard him clearing the table I went in, and, summoning up&#10;my Italian, or rather Neapolitan &#8211; the Southern dialect- are&#10;execrable &#8211; I said, &#8220;Gennaro! I heard you address Signor Eustace&#10;with &#8216;Tu.&#8217;&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;It is true.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;You are not right. You must use &#8216;Lei&#8217; or &#8216;Voi&#8217; &#8211; more polite&#10;forms. And remember that, though Signor Eustace is sometimes silly&#10;and foolish &#8211; this afternoon for example &#8211; yet you must always&#10;behave respectfully to him; for he is a young English gentleman,&#10;and you are a poor Italian fisherboy.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I know that speech sounds terribly snobbish, but in Italian one&#10;can say things that one would never dream of saying in English.&#10;Besides, it is no speaking delicately to persons of that class.&#10;Unless you put things plainly, they take a vicious pleasure in&#10;misunderstanding you.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;An honest English fisherman would have landed me one in the eye&#10;in a minute for such a remark, but the wretched down-trodden&#10;Italians have no pride. Gennaro only sighed, and said: &#8220;It is&#10;true.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Quite so,&#8221; I said, and turned to go. To my indignation I heard&#10;him add: &#8220;But sometimes it is not important.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; I shouted.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He came close up to me with horrid gesticulating fingers.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Signor Tytler, I wish to say this. If Eustazio asks me to call&#10;him &#8216;Voi,&#8217; I will call&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;him &#8216;Voi.&#8217; Otherwise, no.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With that he seized up a tray of dinner things, and fled from&#10;the room with them; and I heard two more wine-glasses go on the&#10;courtyard floor.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I was now fairly angry, and strode out to interview Eustace. But&#10;he had gone to bed, and the landlady, to whom I also wished to&#10;speak, was engaged. After more vague wonderings, obscurely&#10;expressed owing to the presence of Janet and the two American&#10;ladies, we all went to bed, too, after a harassing and most&#10;extraordinary day.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;III.&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But the day was nothing to the night.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I suppose I had slept for about four hours, when I woke suddenly&#10;thinking I heard a noise in the garden. And immediately, before my&#10;eyes were open, cold terrible fear seized me &#8211; not fear of&#10;something that was happening, like the fear in the wood, but fear&#10;of something that might happen.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Our room was on the first floor, looking out on to the garden &#8211;&#10;or terrace, it was rather: a wedge-shaped block of ground covered&#10;with roses and vines, and intersected with little asphalt paths. It&#10;was bounded on the small side by the house; round the two long&#10;sides ran a wall, only three feet above the terrace level, but with&#10;a good twenty feet drop over it into the olive yards, for the&#10;ground fell very precipitously away.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Trembling all over I stole to the window. There, pattering up&#10;and down the asphalt paths, was something white. I was too much&#10;alarmed to see clearly; and in the uncertain light of the stars the&#10;thing took all manner of curious shape. Now it was a great dog, now&#10;an enormous white bat, now a mass of quickly traveling cloud. It&#10;would bounce like a ball, or take short flights like a bird, or&#10;glide slowly like a wraith. It gave no sound save the pattering&#10;sound of what, after all, must be human feet. And at last the&#10;obvious explanation forced itself upon my disordered mind; and I&#10;realized that Eustace had got out of bed, and that we were in for&#10;something more.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I hastily dressed myself, and went down into the dining-room&#10;which opened upon the terrace. The door was already unfastened. My&#10;terror had almost entirely passed away, but for quite five minutes&#10;I struggled with a curious cowardly feeling, which bade me not&#10;interfere with the poor strange boy, but leave him to his ghostly&#10;patterings, and merely watch him from the window, to see he took no&#10;harm.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But better impulses prevailed and, opening the door, I called&#10;out: &#8220;Eustace! what on earth are you doing? Come in at once.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He stopped his antics, and said: &#8220;I hate my bedroom. I could not&#10;stop in it, it is too small.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Come! come! I&#8217;m tired of affectation. You&#8217;ve never complained&#10;of it before.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Besides I can&#8217;t see anything &#8211; no flowers, no leaves, no sky:&#10;only a stone wall.&#8221; The outlook of Eustace&#8217;s room certainly was&#10;limited; but, as I told him, he had never complained of it&#10;before.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Eustace, you talk like a child. Come in! Prompt obedience, if&#10;you please.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He did not move.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Very well: I shall carry you in by force,&#8221; I added, and made a&#10;few steps towards him. But I was soon convinced of the futility of&#10;pursuing a boy through a tangle of asphalt paths and went in&#10;instead, to call Mr. Sandbach and Leyland to my aid.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When I returned with them he was worse than ever. He would not&#10;even answer us when we spoke, but began singing and chattering to&#10;himself in a most alarming way.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;It&#8217;s a case for the doctor now,&#8221; said Mr. Sandbach, gravely&#10;tapping his forehead.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He had stopped his running and was singing, first low, then loud&#10;&#8211; singing five-finger exercises, scales, hymn tunes, scraps of&#10;Wagner &#8211; anything that came into his head. His voice &#8211; a very&#10;untuneful voice &#8211; grew stronger and stronger, and he ended with a&#10;tremendous shout which boomed like a gun among the mountains, and&#10;awoke everyone who was still sleeping in the hotel. My poor wife&#10;and the two girls appeared at their respective windows, and the&#10;American ladies were heard violently ringing their bell.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Eustace,&#8221; we all cried, &#8220;stop! stop, dear boy, and come into&#10;the house.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He shook his head, and started off again &#8211; talking this time.&#10;Never have I listened to such an extraordinary speech. At any other&#10;time it would have been ludicrous, for here was a boy, with no&#10;sense of beauty and a puerile command of words, attempting to&#10;tackle themes which the greatest poets have found almost beyond&#10;their power. Eustace Robinson, aged fourteen, was standing in his&#10;nightshirt saluting, praising, and blessing, the great forces and&#10;manifestations of Nature.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He spoke first of night and the stars and planets above his&#10;head, of the swarms of fireflies below him, of the invisible sea&#10;below the fireflies, of the great rocks covered with anemones and&#10;shells that were slumbering in the invisible sea. He spoke of the&#10;rivers and waterfalls, of the ripening bunches of grapes, of the&#10;smoking cone of Vesuvius and the hidden fire-channels that made the&#10;smoke, of the myriads of lizards who were lying curled up in the&#10;crannies of the sultry earth, of the showers of white rose-leaves&#10;that were tangled in his hair. And then he spoke of the rain and&#10;the wind by which all things are changed, of the air through which&#10;all things live, and of the woods in which all things can be&#10;hidden.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Of course, it was all absurdly high-faluting: yet I could have&#10;kicked Leyland for audibly observing that it was &#8216;a diabolical&#10;caricature of all that was most holy and beautiful in life.&#8217;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;And then,&#8221; &#8211; Eustace was going on in the pitiable&#10;conversational doggerel which was his only mode of expression &#8211;&#10;&#8220;and then there are men, but I can&#8217;t make them out so well.&#8221; He&#10;knelt down by the parapet, and rested his head on his arms.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Now&#8217;s the time,&#8221; whispered Leyland. I hate stealth, hut we&#10;darted forward and endeavored to catch hold of him from behind. He&#10;was away in a twinkling, but turned round at once to look at us. As&#10;far as I could see in the starlight, he was crying. Leyland rushed&#10;at him again, and we tried to corner him among the asphalt paths,&#10;hut without the slightest approach to success.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;We returned, breathless and discomfited, leaving him to his&#10;madness in the further&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;corner of the terrace. But my Rose had an inspiration.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Papa,&#8221; she called from the window, &#8220;if you get Gennaro, he&#10;might he able to catch him for you.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I had no wish to ask a favor of Gennaro, but, as the landlady&#10;had by now appeared on the scene, I begged her to summon him from&#10;the charcoal-bin in which he slept, and make him try what he could&#10;do.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She soon returned, and was shortly followed by Gennaro, attired&#10;in a dress coat, without either waistcoat, shirt, or vest, and a&#10;ragged pair of what had been trousers, cut short above the knees&#10;for purposes of wading. The landlady, who had quite picked up&#10;English ways, rebuked him for the incongruous and even indecent&#10;appearance which he presented.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I have a coat and I have trousers. What more do you&#10;desire?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Never mind, Signora Scafetti,&#8221; I put in. &#8220;As there are no&#10;ladies here, it is not of the slightest consequence.&#8221; Then, turning&#10;to Gennaro, I said: &#8220;The aunts of Signor&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Eustace wish you to fetch him into the house.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He did not answer.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Do you hear me? He is not well. I order you to fetch him into&#10;the house.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Fetch! fetch!&#8221; said Signora Scafetti, and shook him roughly by&#10;the arm.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Eustazio is well where he is.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Fetch! fetch!&#8221; Signora Scafetti screamed, and let loose a flood&#10;of Italian, most of which, I am glad to say, I could not follow. I&#10;glanced up nervously at the girls&#8217; window, but they hardly know as&#10;much as I do, and I am thankful to say that none of us caught one&#10;word of Gennaro&#8217;s answer.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The two yelled and shouted at each other for quite ten minutes,&#10;at the end of which Gennaro rushed hack to his charcoal-bin and&#10;Signora Scafetti burst into tears, as well she might, for she&#10;greatly valued her English guests .&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;He says,&#8221; she sobbed, &#8220;that Signor Eustace is well where he is,&#10;and that he will not fetch him. I can do no more.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But I could, for, in my stupid British way, I have got some&#10;insight into the Italian character. I followed Mr. Gennaro to his&#10;place of repose, and found him wriggling down on a dirty sack.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I wish you to fetch Signor Eustace to me,&#8221; I began.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He hurled at me an unintelligible reply.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;If you fetch him, I will give you this.&#8221; And out of my pocket I&#10;took a new ten lira note.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;This time he did not answer.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;This note is equal to ten lire in silver,&#8221; I continued, for I&#10;knew that the poor-class Italian is unable to conceive of a single&#10;large sum.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I know it.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;That is, two hundred soldi.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I do not desire them. Eustazio is my friend.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I put the note into my pocket.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Besides, you would not give it me.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I am an Englishman. The English always do what they&#10;promise.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;That is true.&#8221; It is astonishing how the most dishonest of&#10;nations trust us. Indeed they often trust us more than we trust one&#10;another. Gennaro knelt up on his sack. It was too dark to see his&#10;face, but I could feel his warm garlicky breath coming out in&#10;gasps, and I knew that the eternal avarice of the South had laid&#10;hold upon him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I could not fetch Eustazio to the house. He might die&#10;there.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;You need not do that,&#8221; I replied patiently. &#8220;You need only&#10;bring him to me; and I will stand outside in the garden.&#8221; And to&#10;this, as if it were something quite different, the pitiable youth&#10;consented.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;But give me first the ten lire.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;No &#8220; &#8211; for I knew the kind of person with which I had to deal.&#10;Once faithless, always faithless.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;We returned to the terrace, and Gennaro, without a single word,&#10;pattered off towards the pattering that could be heard at the&#10;remoter end. Mr. Sandbach, Leyland, and myself moved away a little&#10;from the house, and stood in the shadow of the white climbing&#10;roses, practically invisible.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;We heard &#8220;Eustazio&#8221; called, followed by absurd cries of pleasure&#10;from the poor boy. The pattering ceased, and we heard them talking.&#10;Their voices got nearer, and presently I could discern them through&#10;the creep the grotesque figure of the young man, and the slim&#10;little white-robed boy. Gennaro had his arm round Eustace&#8217;s neck,&#10;and Eustace was talking away in his fluent, slipshod Italian.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I understand almost everything,&#8221; I heard him say. &#8220;The trees,&#10;hills, stars, water, I can see all. But isn&#8217;t it odd! I can&#8217;t make&#10;out men a bit. Do you know what I mean?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Ho capito,&#8221; said Gennaro gravely, and took his arm off&#10;Eustace&#8217;s shoulder. But I&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;made the new note crackle in my pocket; and he heard it. He&#10;stuck his hand out with a jerk; and the unsuspecting Eustace&#10;gripped it in his own.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;It is odd!&#8221; Eustace went on &#8211; they were quite close now &#8211; &#8220;It&#10;almost seems as if &#8211; as if &#8211;&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I darted out and caught hold of his arm, and Leyland got hold of&#10;the other arm, and Mr. Sandbach hung on to his feet. He gave shrill&#10;heart-piercing screams; and the white roses, which were falling&#10;early that year, descended in showers on him as we dragged him into&#10;the house.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As soon as we entered the house he stopped shrieking; but floods&#10;of tears silently burst forth, and spread over his upturned&#10;face.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Not to my room,&#8221; he pleaded. &#8220;It is so small.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;His infinitely dolorous look filled me with strange pity, but&#10;what could I do? Besides, his window was the only one that had bars&#10;to it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Never mind, dear boy,&#8221; said kind Mr. Sandbach. &#8220;I will bear you&#10;company till the morning.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At this his convulsive struggles began again. &#8220;Oh, please, not&#10;that. Anything but that. I will promise to lie still and not to cry&#10;more than I can help, if I am left alone.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So we laid him on the bed, and drew the sheets over him, and&#10;left him sobbing bitterly, and saying: &#8220;I nearly saw everything,&#10;and now I can see nothing at all.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;We informed the Miss Robinsons of all that had happened, and&#10;returned to the dining-room, where we found Signora Scafetti and&#10;Gennaro whispering together. Mr. Sandbach got pen and paper, and&#10;began writing to the English doctor at Naples. I at once drew out&#10;the note, and flung it down on the table to Gennaro.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Here is your pay,&#8221; I said sternly, for I was thinking of the&#10;Thirty Pieces of Silver.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Thank you very much, sir,&#8221; said Gennaro, and grabbed it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He was going off, when Leyland, whose interest and indifference&#10;were always equally misplaced, asked him what Eustace had meant by&#10;saying &#8216;he could not make out men a bit.&#8217;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I cannot say. Signor Eustazio&#8221; (I was glad to observe a little&#10;deference at last) &#8220;has a subtle brain. He understands many&#10;things.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;But I heard you say you understood,&#8221; Leyland persisted.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I understand, but I cannot explain. I am a poor Italian&#10;fisher-lad. Yet, listen: I will try.&#8221; I saw to my alarm that his&#10;manner was changing, and tried to stop him. But he sat down on the&#10;edge of the table and started off, with some absolutely incoherent&#10;remarks.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;It is sad,&#8221; he observed at last. &#8220;What has happened is very&#10;sad. But what can I do? I am poor. It is not I.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I turned away in contempt. Leyland went on asking questions. He&#10;wanted to know who it was that Eustace had in his mind when he&#10;spoke.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;That is easy to say,&#8221; Gennaro gravely answered. &#8220;It is you, it&#10;is I. It is all in this house, and many outside it. If he wishes&#10;for mirth, we discomfort him. If he asks to be alone, we disturb&#10;him. He longed for a friend, and found none for fifteen years. Then&#10;he found me, and the first night I &#8211; I who have been in the woods&#10;and understood things too &#8211; betray him to you, and send him in to&#10;die. But what could I do?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Gently, gently,&#8221; said I.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Oh, assuredly he will die. He will lie in the small room all&#10;night, and in the morning he will be dead. That I know for&#10;certain.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;There, that will do,&#8221; said Mr. Sandbach. &#8220;I shall be sitting&#10;with him.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Filomena Giusti sat all night with Caterina, but Caterina was&#10;dead in the morning. They would not let her out, though I begged,&#10;and prayed, and cursed, and beat the door, and climbed the wall.&#10;They were ignorant fools, and thought I wished to carry her away.&#10;And in the morning she was dead.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;What is all this?&#8221; I asked Signora Scafetti.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;All kinds of stories will get about,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;and he,&#10;least of anyone, has reason to repeat them.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;And I am alive now,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;because I had neither parents&#10;nor relatives nor&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;friends, so that, when the first night came, I could run through&#10;the woods, and climb the rocks, and plunge into the water, until I&#10;had accomplished my desire!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;We heard a cry from Eustace&#8217;s room &#8211; a faint but steady sound,&#10;like the sound of wind in a distant wood heard by one standing in&#10;tranquility.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;That,&#8221; said Gennaro, &#8220;was the last noise of Caterina. I was&#10;hanging on to her window then, and it blew out past me.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And, lilting up his hand, in which my ten lira note was safely&#10;packed, he solemnly cursed Mr. Sandbach, and Leyland, and myself,&#10;and Fate, because Eustace was dying in the upstairs room. Such is&#10;the working of the Southern mind; and I verily believe that he&#10;would not have moved even then, had not Leyland, that unspeakable&#10;idiot, upset the lamp with his elbow. It was a patent&#10;self-extinguishing lamp, bought by Signora Scafetti, at my special&#10;request, to replace the dangerous thing that she was using. The&#10;result was, that it went out; and the mere physical change from&#10;light to darkness had more power over the ignorant animal nature of&#10;Gennaro than the most obvious dictates of logic and reason. I felt,&#10;rather than saw, that he had left the room and shouted out to Mr.&#10;Sandbach: &#8220;Have you got the key of Eustace&#8217;s room in your pocket?&#8221;&#10;But Mr. Sandbach and Leyland were both on the floor, having&#10;mistaken each other for Gennaro, and some more precious time was&#10;wasted in finding a match. Mr. Sandbach had only just time to say&#10;that he had left the key in the door, in case the Miss Robinsons&#10;wished to pay Eustace a visit, when we heard a noise on the stairs,&#10;and there was Gennaro, carrying Eustace down.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;We rushed out and blocked up the passage, and they lost heart&#10;and retreated to the upper landing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Now they are caught,&#8221; cried Signora Scafetti. &#8220;There is no&#10;other way out.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;We were cautiously ascending the staircase, when there was a&#10;terrific scream from my wife&#8217;s room, followed by a heavy thud on&#10;the asphalt path. They had leapt out of her window.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I reached the terrace just in time to see Eustace jumping over&#10;the parapet of the garden wall. This time I knew for certain he&#10;would be killed. But he alighted in an olive tree, looking like a&#10;great white moth, and from the tree he slid on to the earth. And as&#10;soon as his bare feet touched the clods of earth he uttered a&#10;strange loud cry, such as I should not have thought the human voice&#10;could have produced, and disappeared among the trees below.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;He has understood and he is saved,&#8221; cried Gennaro, who was&#10;still sitting on the asphalt path. &#8220;Now, instead of dying he will&#10;live!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;And you, instead of keeping the ten lire, will give them up.&#8221; I&#10;retorted, for at this&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;theatrical remark I could contain myself no longer.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;The ten lire are mine,&#8221; he hissed back, in a scarcely audible&#10;voice. He clasped his hand over his breast to protect his&#10;ill-gotten gains, and, as he did so, he swayed forward and fell&#10;upon his face on the path. He had not broken any limbs, and a leap&#10;like that would never have killed an Englishman, for the drop was&#10;not great. But those miserable Italians have no stamina. Something&#10;had gone wrong inside him, and he was dead.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The morning was still far off, but the morning breeze had begun,&#10;and more rose leaves fell on us as we carried him in. Signora&#10;Scafetti burst into screams at the sight of the dead body, and, far&#10;down the valley towards the sea, there still resounded the shouts&#10;and the laughter of the escaping boy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 17, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4045', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('The Other Side of the Hedge'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;My pedometer told me that I was twenty-five; and, though it is a&#10;shocking thing to stop walking, I was so tired that I sat down on a&#10;milestone to rest. People outstripped me, jeering as they did so,&#10;but I was too apathetic to feel resentful, and even when Miss Eliza&#10;Dimbleby, the great educationist, swept past, exhorting me to&#10;persevere, I only smiled and raised my hat.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;At first I thought I was going to be like my brother, whom&#10;I had had to leave by the roadside a year or two round the corner.&#10;He had wasted his breath on singing, and his strength on helping&#10;others. But I had traveled more wisely, and now it was only the&#10;monotony of the highway that oppressed me &#8211; dust under foot and&#10;brown crackling hedges on either side, ever since I could&#10;remember.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;And I had already dropped several things &#8211; indeed, the&#10;road behind was strewn with the things we all had dropped; and the&#10;white dust was settling down on them, so that already they looked&#10;no better than stones. My muscles were so weary that I could not&#10;even bear the weight of those things I still carried. I slid off&#10;the milestone into the road, and lay there prostrate, with my face&#10;to the great parched hedge, praying that I might give up.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;A little puff of air revived me. It seemed to come from&#10;the hedge; and, when I opened my eyes, there was a glint of light&#10;through the tangle of boughs and dead leaves. The hedge could not&#10;be as thick as usual. In my weak, morbid state, I longed to force&#10;my way in, and see what was on the other side. No one was in sight,&#10;or I should not have dared to try. For we of the road do not admit&#10;in conversation that there is another side at all.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;I yielded to the temptation, saying to myself that I would&#10;come back in a minute. The thorns scratched my face, and I had to&#10;use my arms as a shield, depending on my feet alone to push me&#10;forward. Halfway through I would have gone back, for in the passage&#10;all the things I was carrying were scraped off me, and my clothes&#10;were torn. But I was so wedged that return was impossible, and I&#10;had to wriggle blindly forward, expecting every moment that my&#10;strength would fail me, and that I should perish in the&#10;undergrowth.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;Suddenly cold water closed round my head, and I seemed&#10;sinking down forever. I had fallen out of the hedge into a deep&#10;pool. I rose to the surface at last, crying for help, and I heard&#10;someone on the opposite bank laugh and say: &#8220;Another!&#8221; And then I&#10;was twitched out and laid panting on the dry ground.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;Even when the water was out of my eyes, I was still dazed,&#10;for I had never been in so large a space, nor seen such grass and&#10;sunshine. The blue sky was no longer a strip, and beneath it the&#10;earth had risen grandly into hills &#8211; clean, bare buttresses, with&#10;beech trees in their folds, and meadows and clear pools at their&#10;feet. But the hills were not high, and there was in the landscape a&#10;sense of human occupation &#8211; so that one might have called it a&#10;park, or garden, if the words did not imply a certain triviality&#10;and constraint.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;As soon as I got my breath, I turned to my rescuer and&#10;said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;Where does this place lead to?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;Nowhere, thank the Lord!&#8221; said he, and laughed. He was a&#10;man of fifty or sixty &#8211; just the kind of age we mistrust on the&#10;road &#8211; but there was no anxiety in his manner, and his voice was&#10;that of a boy of eighteen.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;But it must lead somewhere!&#8221; I cried, too much surprised&#10;at his answer to thank him for saving my life.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;He wants to know where it leads!&#8221; he shouted to some men&#10;on the hillside, and they laughed back, and waved their caps.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;I noticed then that the pool into which I had fallen was&#10;really a moat which bent round to the left and to the right, and&#10;that the hedge followed it continually. The hedge was green on this&#10;side &#8211; its roots showed through the clear water, and fish swam&#10;about in them &#8211; and it was wreathed over with dog-roses and&#10;traveler&#8217;s joy. But it was a barrier, and in a moment I lost all&#10;pleasure in the grass, the sky, the trees, the happy men and women,&#10;and realized that the place was but a prison, for all its beauty&#10;and extent.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;We moved away from the boundary, and then followed a path&#10;almost parallel to it, across the meadows. I found it difficult&#10;walking, for I was always trying to out-distance my companion, and&#10;there was no advantage in doing this if the place led nowhere. I&#10;had never kept step with anyone since I left my brother.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;I amused him by stopping suddenly and saying&#10;disconsolately, &#8220;This is perfectly terrible. One cannot advance:&#10;one cannot progress. Now we of the road &#8211;&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;Yes. I know.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;I was going to say, we advance continually.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;I know.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;We are always learning, expanding, developing. Why, even&#10;in my short life I have seen a great deal of advance &#8211; the&#10;Transvaal War, the Fiscal Question, Christian Science, Radium. Here&#10;for example &#8211;&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;I took out my pedometer, but it still marked twenty-five,&#10;not a degree more.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s stopped! I meant to show you. It should have&#10;registered all the time I was walking with you. But it makes me&#10;only twenty-five.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;Many things don&#8217;t work in here,&#8221; he said. &#8220;One day a man&#10;brought in a Lee-Metford, and that wouldn&#8217;t work.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;The laws of science are universal in their application.&#10;It must be the water in the moat that has injured the machinery. In&#10;normal conditions everything works. Science and the spirit of&#10;emulation &#8211; those are the forces that have made us what we&#10;are.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;I had to break off and acknowledge the pleasant greetings&#10;of people whom we passed. Some of them were singing, some talking,&#10;some engaged in gardening, hay-making, or other rudimentary&#10;industries. They all seemed happy; and I might have been happy too,&#10;if I could have forgotten that the place led nowhere.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;I was startled by a young man who came sprinting across&#10;our path, took a little fence in fine style, and went tearing over&#10;a plowed field till he plunged into a lake, across which he began&#10;to swim. Here was true energy, and I exclaimed: &#8220;A cross-country&#10;race! Where are the others?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;There are no others,&#8221; my companion replied; and, later&#10;on, when we passed some long grass from which came the voice of a&#10;girl singing exquisitely to herself, he said again: &#8220;There are no&#10;others.&#8221; I was bewildered at the waste in production, and murmured&#10;to myself, &#8220;What does it all mean?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;He said: &#8220;It means nothing but itself&#8221; &#8211; and he repeated&#10;the words slowly, as if I were a child.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;I understand,&#8221; I said quietly, &#8220;but I do not agree. Every&#10;achievement is worthless unless it is a link in the chain of&#10;development. And I must not trespass on your kindness any longer. I&#10;must get back somehow to the road, and have my pedometer&#10;mended.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;First, you must see the gates,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;for we have&#10;gates, though we never use them.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;I yielded politely, and before long we reached the moat&#10;again, at a point where it was spanned by a bridge. Over the bridge&#10;was a big gate, as white as ivory, which was fitted into a gap in&#10;the boundary hedge. The gate opened outwards, and I exclaimed in&#10;amazement, for from it ran a road &#8211; just such a road as I had left&#10;&#8211; dusty under foot, with brown crackling hedges on either side as&#10;far as the eye could reach.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;That&#8217;s my road!&#8221; I cried.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;He shut the gate and said: &#8220;But not your part of the road.&#10;It is through this gate that humanity went out countless ages ago,&#10;when it was first seized with the desire to walk.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;I denied this, observing that the part of the road I&#10;myself had left was not more than two miles off. But with the&#10;obstinacy of his years he repeated: &#8220;It is the same road. This is&#10;the beginning, and though it seems to run straight away from us, it&#10;doubles so often, that it is never far from our boundary and&#10;sometimes touches it.&#8221; He stooped down by the moat, and traced on&#10;its moist margin an absurd figure like a maze. As we walked back&#10;through the meadows, I tried to convince him of his mistake.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;The road sometimes doubles, to be sure, but that is part&#10;of our discipline. Who can doubt that its general tendency is&#10;onward? To what goal we know not &#8211; it may be to some mountain where&#10;we shall touch the sky, it may be over precipices into the sea. But&#10;that it goes forward &#8211; who can doubt that? It is the thought of&#10;that that makes us strive to excel, each in his own way, and gives&#10;us an impetus which is lacking with you. Now that man who passed us&#10;&#8211; it&#8217;s true that he ran well, and jumped well, and swam well; but&#10;we have men who can run better, and men who can jump better, and&#10;who can swim better. Specialization has produced results which&#10;would surprise you. Similarly, that girl &#8211;&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;Here I interrupted myself to exclaim: &#8220;Good gracious me! I&#10;could have sworn it was Miss Eliza Dimbleby over there, with her&#10;feet in the fountain!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;He believed that it was.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;Impossible! I left her on the road, and she is due to&#10;lecture this evening at Tunbridge Wells. Why, her train leaves&#10;Cannon Street in &#8211; of course my watch has stopped like everything&#10;else. She is the last person to be here.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;People always are astonished at meeting each other. All&#10;kinds come through the hedge, and come at all times &#8211; when they are&#10;drawing ahead in the race, when they are lagging behind, when they&#10;are left for dead. I often stand near the boundary listening to the&#10;sounds of the road &#8211; you know what they are &#8211; and wonder if anyone&#10;will turn aside. It is my great happiness to help someone out of&#10;the moat, as I helped you. For our country fills up slowly, though&#10;it was meant for all mankind.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;Mankind have other aims,&#8221; I said gently, for I thought&#10;him well-meaning; &#8220;and I must join them.&#8221; I bade him good evening,&#10;for the sun was declining, and I wished to be on the road by&#10;nightfall. To my alarm, he caught hold of me, crying: &#8220;You are not&#10;to go yet!&#8221; I tried to shake him off, for we had no interests in&#10;common, and his civility was becoming irksome to me. But for all my&#10;struggles the tiresome old man would not let go; and, as wrestling&#10;is not my specialty, I was obliged to follow him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;It was true that I could have never found alone the place&#10;where I came in, and I hoped that, when I had seen the other sights&#10;about which he was worrying, he would take me back to it. But I was&#10;determined not to sleep in the country, for I mistrusted it, and&#10;the people too, for all their friendliness. Hungry though I was, I&#10;would not join them in their evening meals of milk and fruit, and,&#10;when they gave me flowers, I flung them away as soon as I could do&#10;so unobserved. Already they were lying down for the night like&#10;cattle &#8211; some out on the bare hillside, others in groups under the&#10;beeches. In the light of an orange sunset I hurried on with my&#10;unwelcome guide, dead tired, faint for want of food, but murmuring&#10;indomitably: &#8220;Give me life, with its struggles and victories, with&#10;its failures and hatreds, with its deep moral meaning and its&#10;unknown goal!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;At last we came to a place where the encircling moat was&#10;spanned by another bridge, and where another gate interrupted the&#10;line of the boundary hedge. It was different from the first gate;&#10;for it was half transparent like horn, and opened inwards. But&#10;through it, in the waning light, I saw again just such a road as I&#10;had left &#8211; monotonous, dusty, with brown crackling hedges on either&#10;side, as far as the eye could reach.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;I was strangely disquieted at the sight, which seemed to&#10;deprive me of all self-control. A man was passing us, returning for&#10;the night to the hills, with a scythe over his shoulder and a can&#10;of some liquid in his hand. I forgot the destiny of our race. I&#10;forgot the road that lay before my eyes, and I sprang at him,&#10;wrenched the can out of his hand, and began to drink.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;It was nothing stronger than beer, but in my exhausted&#10;state it overcame me in a moment. As in a dream, I saw the old man&#10;shut the gate, and heard him say: &#8220;This is where your road ends,&#10;and through this gate humanity &#8211; all that is left of it &#8211; will come&#10;in to us.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;Though my senses were sinking into oblivion, they seemed&#10;to expand ere they reached it. They perceived the magic song of&#10;nightingales, and the odor of invisible hay, and stars piercing the&#10;fading sky. The man whose beer I had stolen lowered me down gently&#10;to sleep off its effects, and, as he did so, I saw that he was my&#10;brother.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 17, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4045', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('The Celestial Omnibus'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;The boy who resided at Agathox Lodge, 28, Buckingham Park Road,&#10;Surbiton, had often been puzzled by the old signpost that stood&#10;almost opposite. He asked his mother about it, and she replied that&#10;it was a joke, and not a very nice one, which had been made many&#10;years back by some naughty young men, and that the police ought to&#10;remove it. For there were two strange things about this signpost:&#10;firstly, it pointed up a blank alley, and, secondly, it had painted&#10;on it, in faded characters, the words, &#8220;To Heaven.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;What kind of young men were they?&#8221; he asked.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I think your father told me that one of them wrote verses, and&#10;was expelled from the University, and came to grief in other ways.&#10;Still, it was a long time ago. You must ask your father about it.&#10;He will say the same as I do, that it was put up as a joke.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;So it doesn&#8217;t mean anything at all?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;She sent him upstairs to put on his best things, for the&#10;Bonses were coming to tea, and he was to hand the cake-stand.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;It struck him, as he wrenched on his tightening trousers,&#10;that he might do worse than ask Mr. Bons about the signpost. His&#10;father, though very kind, always laughed at him &#8211; shrieked with&#10;laughter whenever he or any other child asked a question or spoke.&#10;But Mr. Bons was serious as well as kind. He had a beautiful house&#10;and lent one books, he was a churchwarden, and a candidate for the&#10;County Council; he had donated to the Free Library enormously, he&#10;presided over the Literary Society, and had Members of Parliament&#10;to stop with him &#8211; in short, he was probably the wisest person&#10;alive.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;Yet even Mr. Bons could only say that the signpost was a&#10;joke &#8211; the joke of a person named Shelley.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;Of course!&#8221; cried the mother: &#8220;I told you so, dear. That&#10;was the name.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;Had you never heard of Shelley?&#8221; asked Mr. Bons.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;No,&#8221; said the boy, and hung his head,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;But is there no Shelley in the house?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;Why, yes!&#8221; exclaimed the lady, in much agitation. &#8220;Dear&#10;Mr. Bons, we aren&#8217;t such Philistines as that. Two at the least. One&#10;a wedding present, and the other, smaller print, in one of the&#10;spare rooms.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;I believe we have seven Shelleys,&#8221; said Mr. Bons, with a&#10;slow smile. Then he brushed the cake crumbs off his stomach &#8211; and,&#10;together with his daughter, rose to go.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;The boy, obeying a wink from his mother, saw them all the&#10;way to the warden gate, and when they had gone he did not at once&#10;return to the house, but gazed for a little up and down Buckingham&#10;Park Road.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;His parents lived at the right end of it. After No. 39 the&#10;quality of the houses dropped very suddenly, and 64 had not even a&#10;separate servants&#8217; entrance. But at the present moment the whole&#10;road looked rather pretty, for the sun had just set in splendor,&#10;and the inequalities of rent were drowned in a saffron afterglow.&#10;Small birds twittered, and the breadwinners&#8217; train shrieked&#10;musically down through the cutting &#8211; that wonderful cutting which&#10;has drawn to itself the whole beauty out of Surbiton. and clad&#10;itself, like any Alpine valley, with the glory of the fir and the&#10;silver birch and the primrose. It was this cutting that had first&#10;stirred desires within the boy &#8211; desires for something just a&#10;little different, he knew not what, desires that would return&#10;whenever things were sunlit as they were this evening, running up&#10;and down inside him, up and down, up and down. till he would feel&#10;quite unusual all over, and as likely as not would want to cry.&#10;This evening he was even sillier, for he slipped across the road&#10;towards the signpost and began to run up the blank alley.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;The alley runs between high walls &#8211; the walls of the&#10;gardens of &#8220;Ivanhoe&#8221; and &#8220;Bella Vista&#8221; respectively. It smells a&#10;little all the way, and is scarcely twenty yards long. including&#10;the turn at the end. So not unnaturally the boy soon came to a&#10;standstill. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to kick that Shelley,&#8221; he exclaimed, and&#10;glanced idly at a piece of paper which was pasted on the wall.&#10;Rather an odd piece of paper, and he read it carefully before he&#10;turned back. This is what he read:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;S. and C.R.C.C.&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Alteration in Service&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;em&#62;Owing to lack of patronage the Company are regretfully&#10;compelled to suspend the hourly service, and to retain only&#10;the&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Sunrise and Sunset Omnibuses,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;which will run as usual. It is to be hoped that the public&#10;will patronize an arrangement which is intended for their&#10;convenience. As an extra inducement the Company will, for the first&#10;time, now issue&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Return Tickets!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;(available one day only), which may be obtained of the&#10;driver. Passengers are again reminded that no tickets are issued at&#10;the other end, and that no complaints in this connection will&#10;receive consideration from the Company. Nor will the Company be&#10;responsible for any negligence or stupidity on the part of&#10;Passengers, nor for Hailstorms, Lightning, Loss of Tickets, nor for&#10;any act of God.&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For the Direction.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;Now he had never seen this notice before, nor could he&#10;imagine where the omnibus went to. S, of course was for Surbiton,&#10;and R.C.C. meant Road Car Company. But what was the meaning of the&#10;other C.? Coombe and Maiden, perhaps, or possibly &#8220;City.&#8221; Yet it&#10;could not hope to compete with the South-Western. The whole thing,&#10;the boy reflected, was run on hopelessly unbusiness-like lines. Why&#10;not tickets from the other end? And what an hour to start! Then he&#10;realized that unless the notice was a hoax. an omnibus must have&#10;been starting just as he was wishing the Bonses good-bye. He peered&#10;at the ground through the gathering dusk, and there he saw what&#10;might or might not be the marks of wheels. Yet nothing had come out&#10;of the alley. And he had never seen an omnibus at any time in the&#10;Buckingham Park Road. No, it must be a hoax, like the signposts &#8211;&#10;like the fairy tales, like the dreams upon which he would wake&#10;suddenly in the night. And with a sigh he stepped from the alley &#8211;&#10;right into the arms of his father.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;Oh, how his father laughed! &#8220;Poor, poor Popsey!&#8221; he cried.&#10;&#8220;Diddums! Diddums! Diddums think he&#8217;d walky-palky up to Ewink!&#8221; And&#10;his mother, also convulsed with laughter, appeared on the steps of&#10;Agathox Lodge. &#8220;Don&#8217;t, Bob!&#8221; she gasped. &#8220;Don&#8217;t be so naughty! Oh,&#10;you&#8217;ll kill me! Oh, leave the boy alone!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;But all that evening the joke was kept up. The father&#10;implored to be taken too. Was it a very tiring walk? Need one wipe&#10;one&#8217;s shoes on the doormat? And the boy went to bed feeling faint&#10;and sore, and thankful for only one thing &#8211; that he had not said a&#10;word about the omnibus. It was a hoax, yet through his dreams it&#10;grew more and more real, and the streets of Surbiton, through which&#10;he saw it driving, seemed instead to become hoaxes and shadows. And&#10;very early in the morning he woke with a cry, for he had had a&#10;glimpse of its destination.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;He struck a match, and its light fell not only on his&#10;watch but also on his calendar, so that he knew it to be half an&#10;hour to sunrise. It was pitch dark, for the fog had come down from&#10;London in the night, and all Surbiton was wrapped in its embrace.&#10;Yet he sprang out and dressed himself, for he was determined to&#10;settle once for all which was real: the omnibus or the streets. &#8220;I&#10;shall be a fool one way or the other,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;Until I know.&#8221;&#10;Soon he was shivering in the road under the gas lamp that guarded&#10;the entrance to the alley.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;To enter the alley itself required some courage. Not only&#10;was it horribly dark, but he now realized that it was an impossible&#10;terminus for an omnibus. If it had not been for a policeman, whom&#10;he heard approaching through the fog, he would never have made the&#10;attempt. The next moment he had made the attempt and failed.&#10;Nothing. Nothing but a blank alley and a very silly boy gaping at&#10;its dirty floor. It was a hoax. &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell papa and mamma,&#8221; he&#10;decided. &#8220;I deserve it. I deserve that they should know. I am too&#10;silly to be alive.&#8221; And he went back to the gate of Agathox Lodge.&#10;There he remembered that his watch was fast. The sun was not risen:&#10;it would not rise for two minutes. &#8220;Give the bus every chance,&#8221; he&#10;thought cynically, and returned into the alley.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;But the omnibus was there.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;It had two horses, whose sides were still smoking from&#10;their journey, and its two great lamps shone through the fog&#10;against the alley&#8217;s walls, changing their cobwebs and moss into&#10;tissues of fairyland. The driver was huddled up in a cape. He faced&#10;the blank wall, and how he had managed to drive in so neatly and so&#10;silently was one of the many things that the boy never discovered.&#10;Nor could he imagine how ever he would drive out.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;Please,&#8221; his voice quavered through the foul brown air.&#10;&#8220;Please, is that an omnibus?&#8221; &#8220;Omnibus est,&#8221; said the driver,&#10;without turning round. There was a moments silence. The policeman&#10;passed, coughing, by the entrance of the alley. The boy crouched in&#10;the shadow, for he did not want to be found out. He was pretty&#10;sure, too, that it was a Pirate; nothing else, he reasoned, would&#10;go from such odd places and at such odd hours.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;About when do you start?&#8221; He tried to sound&#10;nonchalant.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;At sunrise.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;How far do you go?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;The whole way.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;And can I have a return ticket which will bring me all&#10;the way back?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;You can.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;Do you know. I half think I&#8217;ll come.&#8221; The driver made no&#10;answer. The sun must have risen, for he unhitched the brake. And&#10;scarcely had the boy jumped in before the omnibus was off.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;How? Did it turn? There was no room. Did it go forward?&#10;There was a blank wall. Yet it was moving &#8211; moving at a stately&#10;pace through the fog, which had turned from brown to yellow. The&#10;thought of warm bed and warmer breakfast made the boy feel faint.&#10;He wished he had not come.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;His parents would not have approved. He would have gone&#10;back to them if the weather had not made it impossible, The&#10;solitude was terrible; he was the only passenger. And the omnibus,&#10;though well-built, was cold and somewhat musty. He drew his coat&#10;round him, and in so doing chanced to feel his pocket. It was&#10;empty. He had forgotten his purse.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;Stop!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;Stop!&#8221; And then, being of a polite&#10;disposition, he glanced up at the painted notice-board so that he&#10;might call the driver by name. &#8220;Mr. Browne! stop; oh, do please&#10;stop!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;Mr. Browne did not stop, but he opened a little window and&#10;looked in at the boy. His face was a surprise &#8211; so kind it was and&#10;modest.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;Mr. Browne &#8211; I&#8217;ve left my purse behind. I&#8217;ve not got a&#10;penny. I can&#8217;t pay for the ticket. Will you take my watch &#8211; please?&#10;I am in the most awful hole.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;Tickets on this line,&#8221; said the driver, &#8220;whether single&#10;or return, can be purchased by coinage from no terrene mint. And a&#10;chronometer, though it had solaced the vigils of Charlemagne, or&#10;measured the slumbers of Laura, can acquire by no mutation the&#10;double-cake that charms the fangless Cerberus of Heaven!&#8221; So&#10;saying, he handed in the necessary ticket, and, while the boy said&#10;&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; continued: &#8220;Titular pretensions. I know it well, are&#10;vanity. Yet they merit no censure when uttered on a laughing lip,&#10;and in an homonymous world are in some sort useful, since they do&#10;serve to distinguish one Jack from his fellow. Remember me.&#10;Therefore &#8211; as Sir Thomas Browne.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;Are you a Sir? Oh, sorry!&#8221; He had heard of these&#10;gentlemen drivers. &#8220;It is good of you about the ticket. But if you&#10;go on at this rate, however does your bus pay?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;It does not pay. It was not intended to pay. Many are the&#10;faults of my equipage; it is compounded too curiously of foreign&#10;woods; its cushions tickle erudition rather than promote repose;&#10;and my horses are nourished not on the evergreen pastures of the&#10;moment, but on the dried bents and clovers of Latinity. But that it&#10;pays! &#8211; that error at all events was never intended and never&#10;attained.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;Sorry again &#8211;&#8221; said the boy rather hopelessly. Sir Thomas&#10;looked sad, fearing that, even for a moment, he had been the cause&#10;of sadness. He invited the boy to come up and sit beside him on the&#10;box, and together they journeyed on through the fog, which was now&#10;changing from yellow to white. There were no houses by the road; so&#10;it must be either Putney Heath or Wimbledon Common.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;Have you been a driver always?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;I was a physician once.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;But why did you stop? Weren&#8217;t you good?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;As a healer of bodies I had scant success, and several&#10;score of my patients preceded me. But as a healer of the spirit I&#10;have succeeded beyond my hopes and my deserts. For though my drafts&#10;were not better nor subtler than those of other men, yet, by reason&#10;of the cunning goblets wherein I offered them, the queasy soul was&#10;ofttimes tempted to sip and be refreshed.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;The queasy soul&#8221; he murmured; &#8220;if the sun sets with trees&#10;in front of it, and you suddenly come strange all over, is that a&#10;queasy soul?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;Have you felt that?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;Why yes.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;After a pause he told the boy a little, a very little,&#10;about the journey&#8217;s end. But they did not chatter much, for the&#10;boy, when he liked a person, would as soon sit silent in his&#10;company as speak, and this, he discovered, was also the mind of Sir&#10;Thomas Browne and of many others with whom he was to be acquainted.&#10;He heard, however, about the young man Shelley, who was now quite a&#10;famous person, with a carriage of his own, and about some of the&#10;other drivers who are in the service of the Company. Meanwhile the&#10;light grew stronger, though the fog did not disperse. It was now&#10;more like mist than fog, and at times would travel quickly across&#10;them, as if it was part of a cloud. They had been ascending, too,&#10;in a most puzzling way; for over two hours the horses had been&#10;pulling against the collar, and even if it were Richmond Hill they&#10;ought to have been at the top long ago. Perhaps it was Epsom, or&#10;even the North Downs; yet the air seemed keener than that which&#10;blows on either. And as to the name of their destination. Sir&#10;Thomas Browne was silent.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;Crash!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;Thunder, by Jove!&#8221; said the boy, &#8220;and not so far off&#10;either. Listen to the echoes! It&#8217;s more like mountains.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;He thought, not very vividly, of his father and mother. He&#10;saw them sitting down to sausages and listening to the storm. He&#10;saw his own empty place. Then there would be questions, alarms,&#10;theories, jokes, consolations. They would expect him back at lunch.&#10;To lunch he would not come, nor to tea, but he would be in for&#10;dinner, and so his day&#8217;s truancy would be over. If he had had his&#10;purse he would have bought them presents &#8211; not that he should have&#10;known what to get them.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;Crash!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;The peal and the lightning came together. The cloud&#10;quivered as if it were alive; and torn streamers of mist rushed&#10;past. &#8220;Are you afraid?&#8221; asked Sir Thomas Browne.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;What is there to be afraid of? Is it much farther?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;The horses of the omnibus stopped just as a ball of fire&#10;burst up and exploded with a ringing noise that was deafening but&#10;clear, like the noise of a blacksmith&#8217;s forge. All the cloud was&#10;shattered.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;Oh, listen, Sir Thomas Browne! No, I mean look; we shall&#10;get a view at last. No, I mean listen; that sounds like a&#10;rainbow!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;The noise had died into the faintest murmur, beneath which&#10;another murmur grew, spreading stealthily, steadily &#8211; in a curve&#10;that widened but did not vary. And in widening curves a rainbow was&#10;spreading from the horses&#8217; feet into the dissolving mists.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;But how beautiful! What colors! Where will it stop? It is&#10;more like the rainbows you can tread on. More like dreams.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;The color and the sound grew together. The rainbow spanned&#10;an enormous gulf. Clouds rushed under it and were pierced by it,&#10;and still it grew, reaching forward, conquering the darkness, until&#10;it touched something that seemed more solid than a cloud.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;The boy stood up. &#8220;What is that out there?&#8221; he called.&#10;&#8220;What does it rest on, out at that other end?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;In the morning sunshine a precipice shone forth beyond the&#10;gulf. A precipice &#8211; or was it a castle? The horses moved. They set&#10;their feet upon the rainbow.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;Oh, look!&#8221; the boy shouted. &#8220;Oh &#8211; listen! Those caves &#8211;&#10;or are they gateways? Oh, look between those cliffs at those&#10;ledges. I see people! I see trees!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;Look also below,&#8221; whispered Sir Thomas. &#8220;Neglect not the&#10;diviner Acheron.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;The boy looked below, past the flames of the rainbow that&#10;licked against their wheels. The gulf also had cleared, and in its&#10;depths there flowed an everlasting river. One sunbeam entered and&#10;struck a green pool. and as they passed over he saw three maidens&#10;rise to the surface of the pool, singing, and playing with&#10;something that glistened like a ring.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;You down in the water &#8211;&#8221; he called.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;They answered, &#8220;You up on the bridge &#8211;&#8221; There was a burst&#10;of music. &#8220;You up on the bridge, good luck to you. Truth in the&#10;depth &#8211; truth on the height.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;You down in the water, what are you doing?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;Sir Thomas Browne replied: &#8220;They sport in the mancipiary&#10;possession of their gold&#8221;; and the omnibus arrived.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;The boy was in disgrace. He sat locked up in the nursery&#10;of Agathox Lodge, learning poetry for a punishment. His father had&#10;said, &#8220;My boy! I can pardon anything but untruthfulness,&#8221; and had&#10;caned him, saying at each stroke, &#8220;There is no onmibus, no driver,&#10;no bridge, no mountain; you are a truant, a guttersnipe, a liar.&#8221;&#10;His father could be very stern at times. His mother had begged him&#10;to say he was sorry. But he could not say that. It was the greatest&#10;day of his life, in spite of the caning and the poetry at the end&#10;or it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;He had returned punctually at sunset &#8211; driven not by Sir&#10;Thomas Browne, but by a maiden lady who was full of quiet fun. They&#10;had talked of omnibuses and also of barouche landaus. How far away&#10;her gentle voice seemed now! Yet it was scarcely three hours since&#10;he had left her up the alley.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;His mother called through the door. &#8220;Dear, you are to come&#10;down and to bring your poetry with you.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;He came down, and found that Mr. Bons was in the&#10;smoking-room with his father. It had been a dinner party.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;Here is the great traveler!&#8221; said his father grimly.&#10;&#8220;Here is the young gentleman who drives in an onmibus over&#10;rainbows, while young ladies sing to him.&#8221; Pleased with his wit, he&#10;laughed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;After all &#8211;&#8221; said Mr. Bons, smiling, &#8220;there is something&#10;a little like it in Wagner. It is odd how, in quite illiterate&#10;minds, you will find glimmers of Artistic Truth. The case interests&#10;me. Let me plead for the culprit. We have all romanced in our time,&#10;haven&#8217;t we?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;Hear how kind Mr. Bons is,&#8221; said his mother, while his&#10;father said. &#8220;Very well. Let him say his poem &#8211; and that will do.&#10;He is going away to my sister on Tuesday, and she will cure him of&#10;this alley-slopering.&#8221; (Laughter.) &#8220;Say your poem.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;The boy began. &#8220;Standing aloof in giant ignorance.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;His father laughed again &#8211; roared. &#8220;One for you, my son!&#10;&#8216;Standing aloof in giant ignorance!&#8217; I never knew these poets&#10;talked sense. Just describes you. Here, Bons, you go in for poetry.&#10;Put him through it, will you, while I fetch up the whisky?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;Yes, give me the Keats,&#8221; said Mr. Bons. &#8220;Let him say his&#10;Keats to me.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;So for a few moments the wise man and the ignorant boy&#10;were left alone in the smoking-room.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;&#8216;Standing aloof in giant ignorance, of thee I dream and&#10;of the Cyclades, as one who sits ashore and longs perchance to&#10;visit &#8211;&#8217;&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;Quite right. To visit what?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;&#8216;To visit dolphin coral in deep seas,&#8217;&#8221; said the boy, and&#10;burst into tears.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;Come, come! why do you cry?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;Because &#8211; because all these words that only rhymed before&#10;&#8211; now that I&#8217;ve come back they&#8217;re me.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;Mr. Bons laid the Keats down. The case was more&#10;interesting than he had expected. &#8220;You!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;This sonnet&#10;you?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;Yes &#8211; and look further on: &#8216;Aye, on the shores of&#10;darkness there is light, and precipices show untrodden green.&#8217; It&#10;is so, sir. All these things are true.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;I never doubted it,&#8221; said Mr. Bons, with closed eyes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;You &#8211; then you believe me? You believe in the omnibus and&#10;the driver and the storm and that return ticket I got for nothing&#10;and &#8211;&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;Tut, tut! No more of your yarns &#8211; my boy. I meant that I&#10;never doubted the essential truth of poetry. Some day, when you&#10;have read more, you will understand what I mean.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;But Mr. Bons, it is so. There is light upon the shores of&#10;darkness. I have seen it coming. Light and a wind.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;Nonsense &#8211;&#8221; said Mr. Bons.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;If I had stopped! They tempted me. They told me to give&#10;up my ticket &#8211; for you cannot come back if you lose your ticket.&#10;They called from the river for it, and indeed I was tempted, for I&#10;have never been so happy as among those precipices. But I thought&#10;of my mother and father, and that I must fetch them. Yet they will&#10;not come, though the road starts opposite our house. It has all&#10;happened as the people up there warned me, and Mr. Bons has&#10;disbelieved me like every one else. I have been caned. I shall&#10;never see that mountain again.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;What&#8217;s that about me?&#8221; said Mr. Bons &#8211; sitting up in his&#10;chair very suddenly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;I told them about you, and how clever you were, and how&#10;many books you had &#8211; and they said, &#8220;Mr. Bons will certainly&#10;disbelieve you.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;Stuff and nonsense, my young friend. You grow&#10;impertinent. I &#8211; well &#8211; I will settle the matter. Not a word to&#10;your father. I will cure you. Tomorrow evening I will myself call&#10;here to take you for a walk, and at sunset we will go up this alley&#10;opposite and hunt for your onmibus, you silly little boy.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;His face grew serious, for the boy was not disconcerted,&#10;but leapt about the room singing, &#8220;Joy! joy! I told them you would&#10;believe me. We will drive together over the rainbow. I told them&#10;that you would come.&#8221; After all &#8211; could there be anything in the&#10;story? Wagner? Keats? Shelley? Sir Thomas Browne? Certainly the&#10;case was interesting.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;And on the morrow evening, though it was pouring with&#10;rain, Mr. Bons did not omit to call at Agathox Lodge.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;The boy was ready, bubbling with excitement, and skipping&#10;about in a way that rather vexed the President of the Literary&#10;Society. They took a turn down Buckingham Park Road, and then &#8211;&#10;having seen that no one was watching them &#8211; slipped up the alley.&#10;Naturally enough (for the sun was setting) they ran straight&#10;against the omnibus.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;Good heavens!&#8221; exclaimed Mr. Bons. &#8220;Good gracious&#10;heavens!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;It was not the omnibus in which the boy had driven first,&#10;nor yet that in which he had returned.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;There were three horses &#8211; black- gray, and white, the gray&#10;being the finest. The driver, who turned round at the mention of&#10;goodness and of heaven, was a sallow man with terrifying jaws and&#10;sunken eyes. Mr. Bons, on seeing him, gave a cry as if of&#10;recognition, and began to tremble violently.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;The boy jumped in.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;Is it possible?&#8221; cried Mr. Bons. &#8220;Is the impossible&#10;possible?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;Sir; come in, sir. It is such a fine omnibus. Oh, here is&#10;his name &#8211; Dan someone.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;Mr. Bons sprang in too. A blast of wind immediately&#10;slammed the omnibus door, and the shock jerked down all the omnibus&#10;blinds, which were very weak on their springs.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;Dan&#38;#160;&#8230; Show me. Good gracious heavens! we&#8217;re&#10;moving.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;Hooray!&#8221; said the boy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;Mr. Bons became flustered. He had not intended to be&#10;kidnapped. He could not find the door handle, nor push up the&#10;blinds. The omnibus was quite dark, and by the time he had struck a&#10;match, night had come on outside also. They were moving&#10;rapidly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;A strange, a memorable adventure,&#8221; he said, surveying the&#10;interior of the omnibus, which was large, roomy, and constructed&#10;with extreme regularity, every part exactly answering to every&#10;other part. Over the door (the handle of which was outside) was&#10;written. &#60;em&#62;Lasciate ogni baldanza voi che entrate&#60;/em&#62; &#8211; at&#10;least, that was what was written, but Mr. Bons said that it was&#10;Lashy arty something &#8211; and that baldanza was a mistake for&#10;speranza. His voice sounded as if he was in church. Meanwhile, the&#10;boy called to the cadaverous driver for two return tickets. They&#10;were handed in without a word. Mr. Bons covered his face with his&#10;hand and again trembled. &#8220;Do you know who that is!&#8221; he whispered,&#10;when the little window had shut upon them. &#8220;It is the&#10;impossible.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t like him as much as Sir Thomas Browne,&#10;though I shouldn&#8217;t be surprised if he had even more in him.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;More in him?&#8221; He stamped irritably. &#8220;By accident you have&#10;made the greatest discovery of the century, and all you can say is&#10;that there is more in this man. Do you remember those vellum books&#10;in my library &#8211; stamped with red lilies? This &#8211; sit still. I bring&#10;you stupendous news! &#8211; this is the man who wrote them.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;The boy sat quite still. &#8220;I wonder if we shall see Mrs.&#10;Gamp?&#8221; he asked &#8211; after a civil pause.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;Mrs. &#8211;?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;Mrs. Gamp and Mrs. Harris. I like Mrs. Harris. I came&#10;upon them quite suddenly. Mrs. Gamp&#8217;s bandboxes have moved over the&#10;rainbow so badly. All the bottoms have fallen out, and two of the&#10;pippins off her bedstead tumbled into the stream.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;Out there sits the man who wrote my vellum books,&#8221;&#10;thundered Mr. Bons &#8211; &#8220;and you talk to me of Dickens and of Mrs.&#10;Gamp?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;I know Mrs. Gamp so well,&#8221; he apologized. &#8220;I could not&#10;help being glad to see her. I recognized her voice. She was telling&#10;Mrs. Harris about Mrs. Prig.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;Did you spend the whole day in her elevating&#10;company?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;Oh &#8211; no. I raced. I met a man who took me out beyond to a&#10;racecourse. You run, and there are dolphins out at sea.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;Indeed. Do you remember the man&#8217;s name?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;Achilles. No; he was later. Tom Jones.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;Mr. Bons sighed heavily. &#8220;Well, my lad, you have made a&#10;miserable mess of it. Think of a cultured person with your&#10;opportunities! A cultured person would have known all these&#10;characters and known what to have said to each. He would not have&#10;wasted his time with a Mrs. Gamp or a Tom Jones. The creations of&#10;Homer, of Shakespeare, and of Him who drives us now, would alone&#10;have contented him. He would not have raced. He would have asked&#10;intelligent questions.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;But, Mr. Bons.&#8221; said the boy humbly, &#8220;you will be a&#10;cultured person. I told them so.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;True, true, and I beg you not to disgrace me when we&#10;arrive. No gossiping. No running. Keep close to my side, and never&#10;speak to these Immortals unless they speak to you. Yes, and give me&#10;the return tickets. You will be losing them.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;The boy surrendered the tickets, but felt a little sore.&#10;After all, he had found the way to this place. It was hard first to&#10;be disbelieved and then to be lectured. Meanwhile, the rain had&#10;stopped, and moonlight crept into the onmibus through the cracks in&#10;the blinds.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;But how is there to be a rainbow?&#8221; cried the boy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;You distract me,&#8221; snapped Mr. Bons. &#8220;I wish to meditate&#10;on beauty. I wish to goodness I was with a reverent and sympathetic&#10;person.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;The lad bit his lip. He made a hundred good resolutions.&#10;He would imitate Mr. Bons all the visit. He would not laugh, or&#10;run, or sing, or do any of the vulgar things that must have&#10;disgusted his new friends last time. He would be very careful to&#10;pronounce their names properly, and to remember who knew whom.&#10;Achilles did not know Tom Jones &#8211; at least, so Mr. Bons said. The&#10;Duchess of Malfi was older than Mrs. Gamp &#8211; at least, so Mr. Bons&#10;said. He would be self-conscious, reticent, and prim. He would&#10;never say he liked anyone. Yet, when the blind flew up at a chance&#10;touch of his head, all these good resolutions went to the winds,&#10;for the omnibus had reached the summit of a moonlit hill, and there&#10;was the chasm, and there, across it &#8211; stood the old precipices,&#10;dreaming, with their feet in the everlasting river. He exclaimed.&#10;&#8220;The mountains! Listen to the new time in the water! Look at the&#10;camp fires in the ravines,&#8221; and Mr. Bons after a hasty glance&#10;retorted. &#8220;Water? Camp fires? Ridiculous rubbish. Hold your tongue.&#10;There is nothing at all.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;Yet, under his eyes, a rainbow formed, compounded not of&#10;sunlight and storm, but of moonlight and the spray of the river.&#10;The three horses put their feet upon it. He thought it the finest&#10;rainbow he had seen, but did not dare to say so, since Mr. Bons&#10;said that nothing was there. He leant out &#8211; the window had opened &#8211;&#10;and sang the tune that rose from the sleeping waters.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;The prelude to Rhinegold,&#8221; said Mr. Bons suddenly. &#8220;Who&#10;taught you these leit motifs.&#8221; He, too, looked out of the window.&#10;Then he behaved very oddly. He gave a choking cry, and fell back on&#10;to the onmibus floor. He writhed and kicked. His face was&#10;green.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;Does the bridge make you dizzy?&#8221; the boy asked.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;Dizzy,&#8221; gasped Mr. Bons. &#8220;I want to go back. Tell the&#10;driver.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;But the driver shook his head.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;We are nearly there,&#8221; said the boy. &#8220;They are asleep.&#10;Shall I call? They will be so pleased to see you, for I have&#10;prepared them.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;Mr. Bons moaned. They moved over the lunar rainbows which&#10;ever and ever broke away behind their wheels. How still the night&#10;was! Who would be sentry at the Gate?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;I am coming,&#8221; he shouted, again forgetting the hundred&#10;resolutions. &#8220;I am returning &#8211; I, the boy.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;The boy is returning.&#8221; cried a voice to other voices &#8211;&#10;who repeated, &#8220;The boy is returning.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;I am bringing Mr. Bons with me.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;Silence.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;I should have said Mr. Bons is bringing me with him.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;Profound silence.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;Who stands sentry?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;Achilles.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;And on the rocky causeway &#8211; close to the springing of the&#10;rainbow bridge, he saw a young man who carried a wonderful&#10;shield.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;Mr. Bons, it is Achilles, armed.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;I want to go back,&#8221; said Mr. Bons.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;The last fragment of the rainbow melted, the wheels sang&#10;upon the living rock, the door of the omnibus burst open. Out leapt&#10;the boy &#8211; he could not resist &#8211; and sprang to meet the warrior,&#10;who, stooping suddenly &#8211; caught him on his shield.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;Achilles!&#8221; he cried &#8211; &#8220;let me get down. for I am ignorant&#10;and vulgar &#8211; and I must wait for that Mr. Bons of whom I told you&#10;yesterday.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;But Achilles raised him aloft. He crouched on the&#10;wonderful shield, on heroes and burning cities, on vineyards graven&#10;in gold, on every dear passion, every joy, on the entire image of&#10;the Mountain that he had discovered, encircled, like it, with an&#10;everlasting stream. &#8220;No, no&#8221; he protested. &#8220;I am not worthy. It is&#10;Mr. Bons who must be up here.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;But Mr. Bons was whimpering, and Achilles trumpeted and&#10;cried, &#8220;Stand upright upon my shield!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;Sir, I did not mean to stand! something made me stand.&#10;Sir, why do you delay? Here is only the great Achilles, whom you&#10;knew.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;Mr. Bons screamed, &#8220;I see no one. I see nothing. I want to&#10;go back.&#8221; Then he cried to the driver. &#8220;Save me! Let me stop in&#10;your chariot. I have honored you. I have quoted you. I have bound&#10;you in vellum. Take me back to my world.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;The driver replied. &#8220;I am the means and not the end. I am&#10;the food and not the life. Stand by yourself, as that boy has&#10;stood. I cannot save you. For poetry is a spirit; and they that&#10;would worship it must worship in spirit and in truth.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;Mr. Bons &#8211; he could not resist &#8211; crawled out of the&#10;beautiful omnibus. His face appeared, gaping horribly. His hands&#10;followed, one gripping the step. the other beating the air. Now his&#10;shoulders emerged, his chest, his stomach. With a shriek of &#8220;I see&#10;London.&#8221; he fell &#8211; fell against the hard, moonlit rock, fell into&#10;it as if it were water, fell through it, vanished, and was seen by&#10;the boy no more.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;Where have you fallen to, Mr. Bons? Here is a procession&#10;arriving to honor you with music and torches. Here come the men and&#10;women whose names you know.&#8221; The mountain is awake, the river is&#10;awake, over the race course the sea is awaking those dolphins, and&#10;it is all for you. They want you &#8211;&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;There was the touch of fresh leaves on his forehead.&#10;Someone had crowned him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#932; &#917; &#923; &#927; &#931;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;From the Kingston Gazette, Surbiton Times, and Raynes Park&#10;Observer&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;The body of Mr. Septimus Bons has been found in a shockingly&#10;mutilated condition in the vicinity of the Bermondsey gas works.&#10;The deceased&#8217;s pockets contained a sovereign-purse, a silver&#10;cigar-case, a bijou pronouncing dictionary, and a couple of omnibus&#10;tickets. The unfortunate gentleman had apparently been hurled from&#10;a considerable height. Foul play is suspected, and a thorough&#10;investigation is pending by the authorities.&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 17, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4045', :deleted => 0)

Yes.&#10;&#60;em&#62;Demens&#60;/em&#62;, of course, is &#60;em&#62;de&#8211;mens&#60;/em&#62;. Ah, witless&#10;fellow! Gods, I say, even gods have dwelt in the woods ere&#10;now.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;But I thought gods always lived in the sky,&#8221; said Mrs. Worters,&#10;interrupting our lesson for I think the third-and-twentieth&#10;time.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Not always,&#8221; answered Miss Beaumont. As she spoke, she inserted&#10;&#8220;witless fellow&#8221; as an alternative to &#8220;silly ass.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I always thought they lived in the sky.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Oh, no, Mrs. Worters,&#8221; the girl repeated. &#8220;Not always.&#8221; And&#10;finding her place in the notebook she read as follows: &#8220;Gods.&#10;Where. Chief deities &#8211; Mount Olympus. Pan &#8211; most places, as name&#10;implies. Oreads &#8211; mountains, Sirens, Tritons, Nereids &#8211; water&#10;(salt). Naiads &#8211; water (fresh). Satyrs, Fauns, etc. &#8211; woods. Dryads&#10;&#8211; trees.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Well, dear, you have learnt a lot. And will you tell me what&#10;good it has done you?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;It has helped me &#8211;&#8221; faltered Miss Beaumont. She was very&#10;earnest over her classics. She wished she could have said what good&#10;they had done her.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Ford came to her rescue. &#8220;Of course it&#8217;s helped you. The&#10;classics are full of tips. They teach you how to dodge things.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I begged my young friend not to dodge his Virgil lesson.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;But they do!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Suppose that long-haired brute Apollo&#10;wants to give you a music lesson. Well, out you pop into the&#10;laurels. Or Universal Nature comes along. You aren&#8217;t feeling&#10;particularly keen on Universal Nature, so you turn into a&#10;reed.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Is Jack mad?&#8221; asked Mrs. Worters.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But Miss Beaumont had caught the allusions &#8211; which were quite&#10;ingenious I must admit. &#8220;And Croesus?&#8221; she inquired. &#8220;What was it&#10;one turned into to get away from Croesus?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I hastened to tidy up her mythology. &#8220;Midas, Miss Beaumont, not&#10;Croesus. And he turns you &#8211; you don&#8217;t turn yourself: he turns you&#10;into gold.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;There&#8217;s no dodging Midas,&#8221; said Ford.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Surely &#8211;&#8221; said Miss Beaumont. She had been learning Latin not&#10;quite a fortnight, but she would have corrected the Regius&#10;Professor.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He began to tease her. &#8220;Oh, there&#8217;s no dodging Midas! He just&#10;comes, he touches you, and you pay him several thousand percent, at&#10;once. You&#8217;re gold &#8211; a young golden lady &#8211; if he touches you.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I won&#8217;t be touched!&#8221; she cried, relapsing into her habitual&#10;frivolity.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Oh, but he&#8217;ll touch you.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;He shan&#8217;t!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;He will.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;He shan&#8217;t!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;He will.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Miss Beaumont took up her Virgil and smacked Ford over the head&#10;with it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Evelyn! Evelyn!&#8221; said Mrs. Worters. &#8220;Now you are forgetting&#10;yourself. And you also forget my question. What good has Latin done&#10;you?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Mr. Inksip &#8211; what good has Latin done us?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So I was let in for the classical controversy. The arguments for&#10;the study of Latin are perfectly sound, but they are difficult to&#10;remember, and the afternoon sun was hot, and I needed my tea. But I&#10;had to justify my existence as a coach, so I took off my&#10;eye-glasses and breathed on them and said, &#8220;My dear Ford, what a&#10;question!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;It&#8217;s all right for Jack,&#8221; said Mrs. Worters, &#8220;Jack has to pass&#10;his entrance examination. But what&#8217;s the good of it for Evelyn?&#10;None at all.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;No, Mrs. Worters,&#8221; I persisted, pointing my eye-glasses at her.&#10;&#8220;I cannot agree. Miss Beaumont is &#8211; in a sense &#8211; new to our&#10;civilization. She is entering it, and Latin is one of the subjects&#10;in her entrance examination also. No one can grasp modern life&#10;without some knowledge of its origins.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;But why should she grasp modern life?&#8221; said the tiresome&#10;woman.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Well, there you are!&#8221; I retorted, and shut up my eye-glasses&#10;with a snap.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Mr. Inskip, I am not there. Kindly tell me what&#8217;s the good of&#10;it all. Oh, I&#8217;ve been&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;through it myself: Jupiter, Venus, Juno, I know the lot of them.&#10;And many of the stories not at all proper.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Classical education,&#8221; I said dryly, &#8220;is not entirely confined&#10;to classical mythology. Though even the mythology has its value.&#10;Dreams if you like, but there is value in dreams.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I too have dreams,&#8221; said Mrs. Worters, &#8220;but I am not so foolish&#10;as to mention them afterwards.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mercifully we were interrupted. A rich virile voice close behind&#10;us said, &#8220;Cherish your dreams!&#8221; We had been joined by our host,&#10;Harcourt Worters &#8211; Mrs. Worter&#8217;s son,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Miss Beaumont&#8217;s fianc&#233;, Ford&#8217;s guardian, my employer: I must&#10;speak of him as Mr. Worters.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Let us cherish our dreams!&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;All day I&#8217;ve been&#10;fighting, haggling, bargaining. And to come out on to this lawn and&#10;see you all learning Latin, so happy, so passionless, so Arcadian&#10;&#8211;&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He did not finish the sentence, but sank into the chair next to&#10;Miss Beaumont, and possessed himself of her hand. As he did so she&#10;sang: &#8220;Ah you silly ass, gods live in woods!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;What have we here?&#8221; said Mr. Worters with a slight frown.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With the other hand she pointed to me.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Virgil &#8211;&#8221; I stammered. &#8220;Colloquial translation &#8211;&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Oh, I see; a colloquial translation of poetry.&#8221; Then his smile&#10;returned. &#8220;Perhaps if gods live in woods, that is why woods are so&#10;dear. I have just bought Other Kingdom Copse!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Loud exclamations of joy. Indeed, the beeches in that copse are&#10;fine as any in Hertfordshire. Moreover, it, and the meadow by which&#10;it is approached, have always made an ugly notch in the rounded&#10;contours of the estate. So we were all very glad that&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Worters had purchased Other Kingdom. Only Ford kept silent,&#10;stroking his head where the Virgil had hit it, and smiling a little&#10;to himself as he did so.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Judging from the price I paid, I should say there was a god in&#10;every tree. But price, this time there was no object.&#8221; He glanced&#10;at Miss Beaumont. &#8220;You admire beeches, Evelyn, do you not?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I forget always which they are. Like this?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She flung her arms up above her head, close together, so that&#10;she looked like a slender column. Then her body swayed and her&#10;delicate green dress quivered over it with the suggestion of&#10;countless leaves.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;My dear child!&#8221; exclaimed her lover.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;No: that is a silver birch,&#8221; said Ford.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Oh, of course. Like this, then.&#8221; And she twitched up her skirts&#10;so that for a moment they spread out in great horizontal layers,&#10;like the layers of a beech.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;We glanced at the house, but none of the servants were looking.&#10;So we laughed, and said she ought to go on the variety stage.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Ah, this is the kind I like!&#8221; she cried, and practiced the&#10;beech-tree again.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I thought so,&#8221; said Mr. Worters. &#8220;I thought so. Other Kingdom&#10;Copse is yours.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Mine?&#8221; She had never had such a present in her life. She could&#10;not realize it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;The purchase will be drawn up in your name. You will sign the&#10;deed. Receive the wood, with my love. It is a second engagement&#10;ring.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;But is it &#8211; is it mine? Can I &#8211; do what I like there?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;You can,&#8221; said Mr. Worters, smiling.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She rushed at him and kissed him. She kissed Mrs. Worters. She&#10;would have kissed myself and Ford if we had not extruded elbows.&#10;The joy of possession had turned her head.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;It&#8217;s mine! I can walk there, work there, live there. A wood of&#10;my own! Mine for ever.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Yours, at all events, for ninety-nine years.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Ninety-nine years?&#8221; I regret to say there was a tinge of&#10;disappointment in her voice.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;My dear child! Do you expect to live longer?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#8220;I suppose I can&#8217;t,&#8221; she replied, and flushed a little. &#8220;I&#10;don&#8217;t know.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Ninety-nine seems long enough to most people. I have got this&#10;house, and the very lawn you are standing on, on a lease of&#10;ninety-nine years. Yet I call them my own, and I think I am&#10;justified. Am I not?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Oh, yes.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Ninety-nine years is practically for ever. Isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Oh, It must be.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Ford possesses a most inflammatory notebook. Outside it is&#10;labeled &#8220;Private,&#8221; inside it is headed &#8220;Practically a book.&#8221; I saw&#10;him make an entry in it now, &#8220;Eternity: practically ninety-nine&#10;years.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Worters, as if speaking to himself, now observed: &#8220;My&#10;goodness! My goodness! How land has risen! Perfectly&#10;astounding.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I saw that he was in need of a Boswell, so I said: &#8220;Has it,&#10;indeed?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;My dear Inskip. Guess what I could have got that wood for ten&#10;years ago! But I refused. Guess why.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;We could not guess why.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Because the transaction would not have been straight.&#8221; A most&#10;becoming blush spread over his face as he uttered the noble word.&#10;&#8220;Not straight. Straight legally. But not morally straight. We were&#10;to force the hands of the man who owned it. I refused. The others &#8211;&#10;decent fellows in their way &#8211; told me I was squeamish. I said,&#10;&#8216;Yes. Perhaps I am. My name is plain Harcourt Worters &#8211; not a&#10;well-known name if you go outside the City and my own country, but&#10;a name which, where it is known, carries, I flatter myself, some&#10;weight. And I will not sign my name to this. That is all. Call me&#10;squeamish if you like. But I will not sign. It is just a fad of&#10;mine. Let us call it a fad.&#8217;&#8221; He blushed again. Ford believes that&#10;his guardian blushes all over &#8211; that if you could strip him and&#10;make him talk nobly he would look like a boiled lobster. There is a&#10;picture of him in this condition in the notebook.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;So the man who owned it then didn&#8217;t own it now?&#8221; said Miss&#10;Beaumont, who had followed the narrative with some interest.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; said Mr. Worters.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Why no!&#8221; said Mrs. Worters absently, as she hunted in the grass&#10;for her knitting- needle. &#8220;Of course not. It belongs to the&#10;widow.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Tea!&#8221; cried her son, springing vivaciously to his feet. &#8220;I see&#10;tea and I want it. Come along, Evelyn. I can tell you it&#8217;s no joke,&#10;a hard day in the battle of life. For life is practically a battle.&#10;To all intents and purposes a battle. Except for a few lucky&#10;fellows who can read books, and so avoid the realities. But I&#10;&#8211;&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;His voice died away as he escorted the two ladies over the&#10;smooth lawn and up the stone steps to the terrace, on which the&#10;footman was placing tables and little chairs and a silver&#10;kettle-stand. More ladies came out of the house. We could just hear&#10;their shouts of excitement as they also were told of the purchase&#10;of Other Kingdom.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I like Ford. The boy has the makings of a scholar and &#8211; though&#10;for some reason he objects to the word &#8211; of a gentleman. It amused&#10;me now to see his lip curl with the vague cynicism of youth. He&#10;cannot understand the footman and the solid silver kettle-stand.&#10;They make him cross. For he has dreams &#8211; not exactly spiritual&#10;dreams: Mr. Worters is the man for those &#8211; but dreams of the&#10;tangible and the actual: robust dreams, which take him, not to&#10;heaven, but to another earth. There are no footmen in this other&#10;earth, and the kettle-stands, I suppose, will not be made of&#10;silver, and I know that everything is to be itself, and not&#10;practically something else. But what this means, and, if it means&#10;anything, what the good of it is, I am not prepared to say. For&#10;though I have just said &#8220;there is value in dreams,&#8221; I only said it&#10;to silence old Mrs. Worters.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Go ahead, man! We can&#8217;t have tea till we&#8217;ve got through&#10;something.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He turned his chair away from the terrace, so that he could sit&#10;looking at the meadows and at the stream that runs through the&#10;meadows, and at the beech-trees of Other Kingdom that rise beyond&#10;the stream. Then, most gravely and admirably, he began to construe&#10;the Eclogues of Virgil.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;II.&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Other Kingdom Copse is like any other beech copse, and I am then&#10;spared the fatigue of describing it. And the stream in front of it,&#10;like many other streams, is not crossed by a bridge in the right&#10;place, and you must either walk round a mile or else you must&#10;paddle. Miss Beaumont suggested that we should paddle.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Worters accepted the suggestion tumultuously. It only became&#10;evident gradually that he was not going to adopt it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;What fun! what fun! We will paddle to your kingdom. If only &#8211;&#10;if only it wasn&#8217;t for the tea-things.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;But you can carry the tea-things on your back.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Why yes! so I can. Or the servants could.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Harcourt &#8211; no servants. This is my picnic, and my wood. I&#8217;m&#10;going to settle everything. I didn&#8217;t tell you: I&#8217;ve got all the&#10;food. I&#8217;ve been in the village with Mr. Ford.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;In the village?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Yes. We got biscuits and oranges and half a pound of tea.&#10;That&#8217;s all you&#8217;ll have. He carried them up. And he&#8217;ll carry them&#10;over the stream. I want you just to lend me some tea-things &#8211; not&#10;the best ones. I&#8217;ll take care of them. That&#8217;s all.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Dear creature&#38;#160;&#8230; &#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Evelyn,&#8221; said Mrs. Worters, &#8220;how much did you and Jack pay for&#10;that tea?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;For the half-pound, ten pence.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mrs. Worters received the announcement in gloomy silence.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Mother!&#8221; cried Mr. Worters. &#8220;Why, I forgot! How could we go&#10;paddling with mother?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Oh, but, Mrs. Worters, we could carry you over.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Thank you, dearest child. I am sure you could.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Alas! alas! Evelyn. Mother is laughing at us. She would sooner&#10;die than be carried. And alas! there are my sisters, and Mrs.&#10;Osgood: she has a cold, tiresome woman. No: we shall have to go&#10;round by the bridge.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;But some of us &#8220; began Ford. His guardian cut him short with a&#10;quick look.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So we went round &#8211; a procession of eight. Miss Beaumont led us.&#10;She was full of fun &#8211; at least I thought at the time, but when I&#10;reviewed her speeches afterwards I could not find in them anything&#10;amusing. It was all this kind of thing: &#8220;Single file! Pretend&#10;you&#8217;re in church and don&#8217;t talk. Mr. Ford, turn out your toes.&#10;Harcourt &#8211; at the bridge throw to the Naiad a pinch of tea. She has&#10;a headache. She has had a headache for nineteen hundred years.&#8221; All&#10;that she said was quite stupid. I cannot think why I liked it at&#10;the time.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As we approached the copse she said, &#8220;Mr. Inskip, sing , and&#10;we&#8217;ll sing after you: Ah you silly ass gods live in woods.&#8221; I&#10;cleared my throat and gave out the abominable phrase, and we all&#10;chanted it as if it were a litany. There was something attractive&#10;about Miss Beaumont. I was not surprised that Harcourt had picked&#10;her out of &#8220;Ireland&#8221; and had brought her home, without money,&#10;without connections, almost without antecedents, to be his bride.&#10;It was daring of him, but he knew himself to be a daring fellow.&#10;She brought him nothing; but that he could afford, he had so vast a&#10;surplus of spiritual and commercial goods. &#8220;In time,&#8221; I heard him&#10;tell his mother, &#8220;in time Evelyn will repay me a thousandfold.&#8221;&#10;Meanwhile there was something attractive about her. If it were my&#10;place to like people, I could have liked her very much.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Stop singing!&#8221; she cried. We had entered the wood. &#8220;Welcome,&#10;all of you.&#8221; We bowed. Ford, who had not been laughing, bowed down&#10;to the ground. &#8220;And now be seated. Mrs. Worters &#8211; will you sit&#10;there &#8211; against that tree with a green trunk? It will show up your&#10;beautiful dress.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Very well, dear, I will,&#8221; said Mrs. Worters.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Anna &#8211; there. Mr. Inskip next to her. Then Ruth and Mrs.&#10;Osgood. Oh, Harcourt &#8211; do sit a little forward, so that you&#8217;ll hide&#10;the house. I don&#8217;t want to see the house at all.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I won&#8217;t!&#8221; laughed her lover, &#8220;I want my back against a tree,&#10;too.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Miss Beaumont,&#8221; asked Ford, &#8220;where shall I sit?&#8221; He was&#10;standing at attention, like a soldier.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Oh, look at all these Worters!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;and one little Ford&#10;in the middle of them!&#8221; For she was at that state of civilization&#10;which appreciates a pun.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Shall I stand, Miss Beaumont? Shall I hide the house from you&#10;if I stand?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Sit down, Jack, you baby!&#8221; cried his guardian, breaking in with&#10;needless asperity. &#8220;Sit down!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;He may just as well stand if he will,&#8221; said she. &#8220;Just pull&#10;back your soft hat, Mr. Ford. Like a halo. Now you hide even the&#10;smoke from the chimneys. And it makes you beautiful.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Evelyn! Evelyn! You are too hard on the boys. You&#8217;ll tire him.&#10;He&#8217;s one of those bookworms. He&#8217;s not strong. Let him sit&#10;down.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you strong?&#8221; she asked.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I am strong!&#8221; he cried. It is quite true. Ford has no right to&#10;be strong, but he is. He never did his dumb-bells or played in his&#10;school fifteen. But the muscles came. He thinks they came while he&#10;was reading Pindar.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Then you may just as well stand, if you will.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Evelyn! Evelyn! childish, selfish maiden! If poor Jack gets&#10;tired I will take his place. Why don&#8217;t you want to see the house!&#10;Eh?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mrs. Worter and the Miss Worters moved uneasily. They saw that&#10;their Harcourt was not quite pleased. Theirs not to question why.&#10;It was for Evelyn to remove his displeasure, and they glanced at&#10;her.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Well, why don&#8217;t you want to see your future home? I must say &#8211;&#10;though I practically planned the house myself &#8211; that it looks very&#10;well from here. I like the gables. Miss! Answer me!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I felt for Miss Beaumont. A home-made gable is an awful thing,&#10;and Harcourt&#8217;s mansion looked like a cottage with the dropsy. But&#10;what would she say?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She said nothing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Well?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was as if he had never spoken. She was as merry, as smiling,&#10;as pretty as ever, and she said nothing. She had not realized that&#10;a question requires an answer.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For us the situation was intolerable. I had to save it by making&#10;a tactful reference to the view, which, I said, reminded me a&#10;little of the country near Veii. It did not &#8211; indeed it could not,&#10;for I have never been near Veii. But it is part of my system to&#10;make classical allusions. And at all events I saved the&#10;situation.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Miss Beaumont was serious and rational at once. She asked me the&#10;date of Veii. I made a suitable answer.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I do like the classics,&#8221; she informed us. &#8220;They are so natural.&#10;Just writing down things.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Ye&#8211;es, said I. &#8220;But the classics have their poetry as well as&#10;their prose. They&#8217;re more than a record of facts.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Just writing down things,&#8221; said Miss Beaumont, and smiled as if&#10;the silly definition pleased her.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Harcourt had recovered himself. &#8220;A very just criticism,&#8221; said&#10;he. &#8220;It is what I always feel about the ancient world. It takes us&#10;but a very little way. It only writes things down.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; asked Evelyn.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I mean this &#8211; though it is presumptuous to speak in the&#10;presence of Mr. Inskip. This is what I mean. The classics are not&#10;everything. We owe them an enormous debt; I am the last to&#10;undervalue it; I, too, went through them at school. They are full&#10;of elegance and beauty. But they are not everything. They were&#10;written before men began to really feel.&#8221; He colored crimson.&#10;&#8220;Hence, the chilliness of classical art &#8211; its lack of&#8211; of a&#10;something. Whereas later things &#8211; Dante &#8211; a Madonna of Raphael &#8211;&#10;some bars of Mendelssohn &#8211;&#8221; His voice tailed reverently away. We&#10;sat with our eyes on the ground, not liking to 1ook at Miss&#10;Beaumont. It is a fairly open secret that she also lacks a&#10;something. She has not yet developed her soul.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The silence was broken by the still small voice of Mrs. Worters&#10;saying that she was faint with hunger.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The young hostess sprang up. She would let none of us help her:&#10;it was her party. She undid the basket and emptied out the biscuits&#10;and oranges from their bags, and boiled the kettle and poured out&#10;the tea, which was horrible. But we laughed and talked with the&#10;frivolity that suits the open air, and even Mrs. Worters&#10;expectorated her flies with a smile. Over us all there stood the&#10;silent, chivalrous figure of Ford, drinking tea carefully lest it&#10;should disturb his outline. His guardian, who is a wag, chaffed him&#10;and tickled his ankles and calves.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Well, this is nice!&#8221; said Miss Beaumont. &#8220;I am happy.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Your wood, Evelyn!&#8221; said the ladies.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Her wood for ever!&#8221; cried Mr. Worters. &#8220;It is an unsatisfactory&#10;arrangement, a ninety-nine years&#8217; lease. There is no feeling of&#10;permanency. I reopened negotiations. I have bought her the wood for&#10;ever &#8211; all right, dear, all right: don&#8217;t make a fuss.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;But I must!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;For everything&#8217;s perfect! Everyone&#8217;s&#10;so kind &#8211; and I didn&#8217;t know most of you a year ago. Oh, it is so&#10;wonderful &#8211; and now a wood &#8211; a wood of my own &#8211; a wood for ever.&#10;All of you coming to tea with me here! Dear Harcourt &#8211; dear people&#10;&#8211; and just where the house would come and spoil things, there is&#10;Mr. Ford!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Ha! ha!&#8221; laughed Mr. Worters, and slipped his hand up round the&#10;boy&#8217;s ankle. What happened I did not know, but Ford collapsed on to&#10;the ground with a sharp cry. To an outsider it might have sounded&#10;like a cry of anger or pain. We, who knew better, laughed&#10;uproariously.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Down he goes! Down he goes!&#8221; And they struggled playfully,&#10;kicking up the mould and the dry leaves.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Don&#8217;t hurt my wood!&#8221; cried Miss Beaumont.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Ford gave another sharp cry. Mr. Worters withdrew his hand.&#10;&#8220;Victory!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Evelyn! behold the family seat!&#8221; But Miss&#10;Beaumont, in her butterfly fashion, had left us, and was strolling&#10;away into her wood.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;We packed up the tea-things and then split into groups. Ford&#10;went with the ladies. Mr. Worters did me the honor to stop by&#10;me.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Well!&#8221; he said, in accordance with his usual formula, &#8220;and how&#10;go the classics?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Fairly well.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Does Miss Beaumont show any ability?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I should say that she does. At all events she has&#10;enthusiasm.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;You do not think it is the enthusiasm of a child? I will be&#10;frank with you, Mr. Inskip. In many ways Miss Beaumont&#8217;s&#10;practically a child. She has everything to learn: she acknowledges&#10;as much herself. Her new life is so different &#8211; so strange. Our&#10;habits &#8211; our thoughts &#8211; she has to be initiated into them all.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I saw what he was driving at, but I am not a fool, and I&#10;replied: &#8220;And how can she be initiated better than through the&#10;classics?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Exactly, exactly,&#8221; said Mr. Worters. In the distance we heard&#10;her voice. She was&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;counting the beech-trees. &#8220;The only question is &#8211; this Latin and&#10;Greek &#8211; what will she do with it? Can she make anything of it? Can&#10;she &#8211; well, it&#8217;s not as if she will ever have to teach it to&#10;others.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;That is true.&#8221; And my features might have been observed to&#10;become undecided.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Whether, since she knows so little &#8211; I grant you she has&#10;enthusiasm, but ought one to divert her enthusiasm &#8211; say to English&#10;literature? She scarcely knows her Tennyson at all. Last night in&#10;the observatory I read her that wonderful scene between Arthur&#10;and&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Guinevere. Greek and Latin are all very well, but I sometimes&#10;feel we ought to begin at the beginning.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;You feel,&#8221; said I, &#8220;that for Miss Beaumont the classics are&#10;something of a luxury.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;A luxury. That is the exact word, Mr. Inskip. A luxury. A whim.&#10;It is all very well for Jack Ford. And here we come to another&#10;point. Surely she keeps Jack back?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Her knowledge must be elementary.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Well, her knowledge is elementary: and I must say that it&#8217;s&#10;difficult to teach them together. Jack has read a good deal, one&#10;way and another, whereas Miss Beaumont, though diligent and&#10;enthusiastic &#8211;&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;So I have been feeling. The arrangement is scarcely fair on&#10;Jack?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Well, I must admit &#8211;&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Quite. I ought never to have suggested it. It must come to an&#10;end. Of course, Mr.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Inskip, it shall make no difference to you, this withdrawal of a&#10;pupil.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;The lessons shall cease at once, Mr. Worters.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Here she came up to us. &#8220;Harcourt, there are seventy-eight&#10;trees. I have had such a&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;count.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He smiled down at her. Let me remember to say that he is tall&#10;and handsome, with a strong chin and liquid brown eyes, and a high&#10;forehead and hair not at all gray. Few things are more striking&#10;than a photograph of Mr. Harcourt Worters.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Seventy-eight trees?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Seventy-eight.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Are you pleased?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Oh, Harcourt &#8211;!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I began to pack up the tea-things. They both saw and heard me.&#10;It was their own fault if they did not go further.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I&#8217;m looking forward to the bridge,&#8221; said he. &#8220;A rustic bridge&#10;at the bottom, and then, perhaps, an asphalt path from the house&#10;over the meadow, so that in all weathers we can walk here dry-shod.&#10;The boys come into the wood &#8211; look at all these initials &#8211; and I&#10;thought of putting a simple fence, to prevent anyone but ourselves&#8211;&#10;&#8220;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Harcourt!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;A simple fence,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;just like what I have put round&#10;my garden and the fields. Then at the other side of the copse, away&#10;from the house, I would put a gate, and have keys &#8211; two keys, I&#10;think &#8211; one for me and one for you &#8211; not more; and I would bring&#10;the asphalt path&#8211;&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;But Harcourt &#8211;&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;But Evelyn!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I &#8211; I &#8211; I &#8211;&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;You &#8211; you &#8211; you?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I &#8211; I don&#8217;t want an asphalt path.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;No? Perhaps you are right. Cinders perhaps. Yes. Or even&#10;gravel.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;But Harcourt &#8211; I don&#8217;t want a path at all. I &#8211; I &#8211; can&#8217;t afford&#10;a path.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He gave a roar of triumphant laughter. &#8220;Dearest! As if you were&#10;going to be bothered! The path&#8217;s part of my present.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;The wood is your present,&#8221; said Miss Beaumont. &#8220;Do you know &#8211; I&#10;don&#8217;t care for the path. I&#8217;d rather always come as we came today.&#10;And I don&#8217;t want a bridge. No &#8211;nor a fence either. I don&#8217;t mind the&#10;boys and their initials. They and the girls have always come up to&#10;Other Kingdom and cut their names together in the bark. It&#8217;s called&#10;the Fourth Time of Asking. I don&#8217;t want it to stop.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Ugh!&#8221; He pointed to a large heart transfixed by an arrow. &#8220;Ugh!&#10;Ugh!&#8221; I suspect that he was gaining time.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;They cut their names and go away, and when the first child is&#10;born they come again and deepen the cuts. So for each child. That&#8217;s&#10;how you know: the initials that go right through to the wood are&#10;the fathers and mothers of large families, and the scratches in the&#10;bark that soon close up are boys and girls who were never married&#10;at all.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;You wonderful person! I&#8217;ve lived here all my life and never&#10;heard a word of this. Fancy folklore in Hertfordshire! I must tell&#10;the Archdeacon: he will be delighted &#8211;&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;And Harcourt, I don&#8217;t want this to stop.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;My dear girl, the villagers will find other trees! There&#8217;s&#10;nothing particular in Other Kingdom.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;But &#8211;&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Other Kingdom shall be for us. You and I alone. Our initials&#10;only.&#8221; His voice sank to a whisper.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I don&#8217;t want it fenced in.&#8221; Her face was turned to me; I saw&#10;that it was puzzled and frightened. &#8220;I hate fences. And bridges.&#10;And all paths. It is my wood. Please: you gave me the wood.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Why, yes!&#8221; he replied, soothing her. But I could see that he&#10;was angry. &#8220;Of course. But aha! Evelyn, the meadow&#8217;s mine; I have a&#10;right to fence there &#8211; between my domain and yours!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Oh, fence me out if you like! Fence me out as much as you like!&#10;But never in. Oh, Harcourt, never in. I must be on the outside, I&#10;must be where anyone can reach me. Year by year &#8211; while the&#10;initials deepen &#8211; the only thing worth feeling &#8211; and at last they&#10;close up &#8211; but one has felt them.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Our initials!&#8221; he murmured, seizing upon the one word which he&#10;had understood and which was useful to him. &#8220;Let us carve our&#10;initials now. You and I &#8211; a heart if you like it, and an arrow and&#10;everything. H.W.&#8211;E.B.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;H.W.,&#8221; she repeated, &#8220;and E.B.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He took out his penknife and drew her away in search of an&#10;unsullied tree. &#8220;E. B., Eternal Blessing. Mine! Mine! My haven from&#10;the world! My temple of purity. Oh, the spiritual exaltation &#8211; you&#10;cannot understand it, but you will! Oh, the seclusion of Paradise.&#10;Year after year alone together, all in all to each other &#8211; year&#10;after year, soul to soul, E. B., Everlasting Bliss!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He stretched out his hand to cut the initials. As he did so she&#10;seemed to awake from a dream. &#8220;Harcourt!&#8217; she cried, &#8220;Harcourt!&#10;What&#8217;s that? What&#8217;s that red stuff on your finger and thumb?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;III.&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Oh, my goodness! Oh, all ye goddesses and gods! Here&#8217;s a mess.&#10;Mr. Worters has been reading Ford&#8217;s inflammatory notebook.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;It is my own fault,&#8221; said Ford. &#8220;I should have labeled it&#10;&#8216;Practically Private.&#8217; How&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;could he know he was not meant to look inside?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I spoke out severely, as an employ&#233; should. &#8220;My dear boy, none&#10;of that. The label came unstuck. That was why Mr. Worters opened&#10;the book. He never suspected it was private. See &#8211; the label&#8217;s&#10;off.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Scratched off,&#8221; Ford retorted grimly, and glanced at his&#10;ankle.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I affected not to understand. &#8220;The point is this. Mr. Worters is&#10;thinking the matter over for four-and-twenty hours. If you take my&#10;advice you will apologize before that time elapses.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;And if I don&#8217;t?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;You know your own affairs of course. But don&#8217;t forget that you&#10;are young and practically ignorant of life, and that you have&#10;scarcely any money of your own. As far as I can see, your career&#10;practically depends on the favor of Mr. Worters. You have laughed&#10;at him. He does not like being laughed at. It seems to me that your&#10;course is obvious.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Apology?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Complete.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;And if I don&#8217;t?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Departure.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He sat down on the stone steps and rested his head on his knees.&#10;On the lawn below us was Miss Beaumont, draggling about with some&#10;croquet balls. Her lover was out in the meadow, superintending the&#10;course of the asphalt path. For the path is to me bade, and so is&#10;the bridge, and the fence is to be built round Other Kingdom after&#10;all. In time Miss Beaumont saw how unreasonable were her&#10;objections. Of her own accord, one evening in the drawing-room, she&#10;gave her Harcourt permission to do what he liked. &#8220;That wood looks&#10;nearer,&#8221; said Ford.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;The inside fences have gone: that brings it nearer. But my dear&#10;boy &#8211; you must settle what you&#8217;re going to do.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;How much has he read?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Naturally he only opened the book. From what you showed me of&#10;it, one glance would be enough.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Did he open at the poems?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Poems?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Did he speak of the poems?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;No. Were they about him?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;They were not about him.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Then it wouldn&#8217;t matter if he saw them.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;It is sometimes a compliment to be mentioned,&#8221; said Ford,&#10;looking up at me. The remark had a stinging fragrance about it &#8211;&#10;such a fragrance as clings to the mouth after admirable wine. It&#10;did not taste like the remark of a boy. I was sorry that my pupil&#10;was likely to wreck his career; and I told him again that he had&#10;better apologize.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I won&#8217;t speak of Mr. Worters&#8217; claim for an apology. That&#8217;s an&#10;aspect on which I prefer not to couth. The point is, if you don&#8217;t&#10;apologize, you go &#8211; where?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;To an aunt at Peckham.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I pointed to the pleasant, comfortable landscape, full of cows&#10;and carriage-horses out at grass, and civil retainers. In the midst&#10;of it stood Mr. Worters, radiating energy and wealth, like a&#10;terrestrial sun. &#8220;My dear Ford &#8211; don&#8217;t be heroic! Apologize.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;Unfortunately I raised my voice a little, and Miss&#10;Beaumont heard me, down on the lawn.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Apologize?&#8221; she cried. &#8220;What about?&#8221; And as she was not&#10;interested in the game, she came up the steps towards us, trailing&#10;her croquet mallet behind her. Her walk was rather listless. She&#10;was toning down at last&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Come indoors!&#8221; I whispered. &#8220;We must get out of this.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Not a bit of it!&#8221; said Ford.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;What is it?&#8221; she asked, standing beside him on the step.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;He swallowed something as he looked up at her. Suddenly I&#10;understood. I knew the nature and the subject of his poems. I was&#10;not so sure now that he had better apologize. The sooner he was&#10;kicked out of the place the better.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In spite of my remonstrances, he told her about the book, and&#10;her first remark was: &#8220;Oh, do let me see it!&#8221; She had no &#8220;proper&#10;feeling&#8221; of any kind. Then she said: &#8220;But why do you both look so&#10;sad?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;We are awaiting Mr. Worters&#8217; decision,&#8221; said I.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Mr. Inskip! What nonsense! Do you suppose Harcourt&#8217;ll be&#10;angry?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Of course he is angry, and rightly so.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;But why?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Ford has laughed at him.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;But what&#8217;s that!&#8221; And for the first time there was anger in her&#10;voice. &#8220;Do you mean to say he&#8217;ll punish someone who laughs at him?&#10;Why, for what else &#8211; for whatever reason are we all here? Not to&#10;laugh at each other! I laugh at people all day. At Mr. Ford. At&#10;you. And so does Harcourt. Oh, you&#8217;ve misjudged him! He won&#8217;t &#8211; he&#10;couldn&#8217;t be angry with people who laughed.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Mine is not nice laughter,&#8221; said Ford.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;He could not well forgive me.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;You&#8217;re a silly boy.&#8221; She sneered at him. &#8220;You don&#8217;t know&#10;Harcourt. So generous in every way. Why, he&#8217;d be as furious as I&#10;should be if you apologized. Mr. Inskip, isn&#8217;t that so?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;He has every right to an apology, I think.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Right? What&#8217;s a right? You use too many new words. &#8216;Rights&#8217; &#8211;&#10;&#8216;apologies&#8217; &#8211; &#8216;society&#8217; &#8211; &#8216;position&#8217; &#8211; I don&#8217;t follow it. What are&#10;we all here for, anyhow?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Her discourse was full of trembling lights and shadows &#8211;&#10;frivolous one moment, the next moment asking why Humanity is here.&#10;I did not take the Moral Science Tripos, so I could not tell&#10;her.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;One thing I know &#8211; and that is that Harcourt isn&#8217;t as stupid as&#10;you two. He soars above conventions. He doesn&#8217;t care about &#8216;rights&#8217;&#10;and apologies. He knows that all laughter is nice, and that the&#10;other nice things are money and the soul and so on.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The soul and so on! I wonder that Harcourt out in the meadows&#10;did not have an apoplectic fit.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Why, what a poor business your life would be,&#8221; she continued,&#10;if you all kept taking offence and apologizing! Forty million&#10;people in England and all of them touchy! How one would laugh if it&#10;was true! Just imagine!&#8221; And she did laugh. &#8220;Look at Harcourt&#10;though. He know better. He isn&#8217;t petty like that. Mr. Ford! He&#10;isn&#8217;t petty like that. Why, what&#8217;s wrong with your eyes?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He rested his head on his knees again, and we could see his eyes&#10;no longer. In dispassionate tones she informed me that she thought&#10;he was crying. Then she tapped him on the hair with her mallet and&#10;said: &#8220;Crybaby! Crybaby! Crying about nothing!&#8221; and ran laughing&#10;down the steps. &#8220;All right!&#8221; she shouted from the lawn. &#8220;Tell the&#10;crybaby to stop. I&#8217;m going to speak to Harcourt!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;We watched her go in silence. Ford had scarcely been crying. His&#10;eyes had only become large and angry. He used such swear-words as&#10;he knew, and then got up abruptly, and went into the house. I think&#10;he could not bear to see her disillusioned. I had no such&#10;tenderness, and it was with considerable interest that I watched&#10;Miss Beaumont approach her lord.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She walked confidently across the meadow, bowing to the workmen&#10;as they raised their hats. Her languor had passed, and with it her&#10;suggestion of &#8220;tone.&#8221; She was the same crude, unsophisticated&#10;person that Harcourt had picked out of Ireland &#8211; beautiful and&#10;ludicrous in the extreme, and &#8211; if you go in for pathos &#8211; extremely&#10;pathetic.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I saw them meet, and soon she was hanging on his arm. The motion&#10;of his hand explained to her the construction of bridges. Twice she&#10;interrupted him: he had to explain everything again. Then she got&#10;in her word, and what followed was a good deal better than a&#10;play.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Their two little figures parted and met and parted again, she&#10;gesticulating, he most pompous and calm. She pleaded, he argued and&#10;&#8211; if satire can carry half a mile &#8211; she tried to be satirical. To&#10;enforce one of her childish points she made two steps back. Splash!&#10;She was floundering in the little stream.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;That was the d&#233;noument of the comedy. Harcourt rescued her,&#10;while the workmen crowded round in an agitated chorus. She was wet&#10;quite as far as her knees, and muddy over her ankles. In this state&#10;she was conducted towards me, and in time I began to hear words;&#10;&#8220;Influenza &#8211; a slight immersion &#8211; clothes are of no consequence&#10;beside health &#8211; pray, dearest, don&#8217;t worry &#8211; yes, it must have been&#10;a shock &#8211; bed! bed! I insist on bed! Promise? Good girl. Up the&#10;steps to bed then.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;They parted on the lawn, and she came obediently up the steps.&#10;Her face was full of terror and bewilderment.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;So you&#8217;ve had a wetting, Miss Beaumont!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Wetting? Oh, yes. But, Mr. Inskip &#8211; I don&#8217;t understand: I&#8217;ve&#10;failed.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I expressed surprise.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Mr. Ford is to go &#8211; at once. I&#8217;ve failed.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I&#8217;ve failed with Harcourt. He&#8217;s offended. He won&#8217;t laugh. He&#10;won&#8217;t let me do what I want. Latin and Greek began it: I wanted to&#10;know about gods and heroes and he wouldn&#8217;t let me: then I wanted no&#10;fence round Other Kingdom and no bridge and no path &#8211; and look! Now&#10;I ask that Mr. Ford, who has done nothing, shan&#8217;t be punished for&#10;it &#8211; and he is to go away forever.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Impertinence is not &#8216;nothing,&#8217; Miss Beaumont.&#8221; For I must keep&#10;in with Harcourt.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Impertinence is nothing!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t exist. It&#8217;s a&#10;sham, like &#8216;claims&#8217; and &#8216;position&#8217; and &#8216;rights.&#8217; It&#8217;s part of the&#10;great dream.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;What &#8216;great dream&#8217;?&#8221; I asked, trying not to smile.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Tell Mr. Ford &#8211; here comes Harcourt; I must go to bed. Give my&#10;love to Mr. Ford, and tell him &#8216;to guess.&#8217; I shall never see him&#10;again, and I won&#8217;t stand it. Tell him to guess. I am sorry I called&#10;him a crybaby. He was not crying like a baby. He was crying like a&#10;grown-up person, and now I have grown up too.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I judged it right to repeat this conversation to my&#10;employer.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;IV.&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The bridge is built, the fence finished, and Other Kingdom lies&#10;tethered by a ribbon of asphalt to our front door. The&#10;seventy-eight trees therein certainly seem nearer, and during the&#10;windy nights that followed Ford&#8217;s departure we could hear their&#10;branches sighing, and would find in the morning that beech-leaves&#10;had been blown right up against the house. Miss Beaumont male no&#10;attempt to go out, much to the relief of the ladies, for Harcourt&#10;had given the word that she was not to go out unattended, and the&#10;boisterous weather deranged their petticoats. She remained indoors,&#10;neither reading nor laughing, and dressing no longer in green, but&#10;in brown.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Not noticing her presence, Mr. Worters looked in one day and&#10;said with a sigh of relief: &#8220;That&#8217;s all right. The circle&#8217;s&#10;completed.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Is it indeed!&#8221; she replied.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;You there, you quiet little mouse? I only meant that our lords,&#10;the British workmen, have at last condescended to complete their&#10;labors and have rounded us off from the world. I &#8211; in the end I was&#10;a naughty, domineering tyrant, and disobeyed you. I didn&#8217;t have the&#10;gate out at the further side of the copse. Will you forgive me?&#10;&#8220;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Anything, Harcourt, that pleases you, is certain to please&#10;me.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The ladies smiled at each other, and Mr. Worters said: &#8220;That&#8217;s&#10;right, and as soon as the wind goes down we&#8217;ll all progress&#10;together to your wood, and take possession of it formally, for it&#10;didn&#8217;t really count that last time.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;No, it didn&#8217;t really count that last time,&#8221; Miss Beaumont&#10;echoed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Evelyn says this wind never will go down,&#8221; remarked Mrs.&#10;Worters. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how she knows.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;It will never go down, as long as I am in the house.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Really?&#8221; he said gaily. &#8220;Then come out now, and send it down&#10;with me.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;They took a few turns up and down the terrace. The wind lulled&#10;for a moment, but blew fiercer than ever during lunch. As we ate,&#10;it roared and whistled down the chimney at us, and the trees of&#10;Other Kingdom frothed like the sea. Leaves and twigs flew from&#10;them, and a bough, a good-sized bough, was blown on to the smooth&#10;asphalt path, and actually switchbacked over the bridge, up the&#10;meadow and across our very lawn. (I venture to say &#8220;our,&#8221; as I am&#10;now staying on as Harcourt&#8217;s secretary.) Only the stone steps&#10;prevented it from reaching the terrace and perhaps breaking the&#10;dining-room window. Miss Beaumont sprang up and, napkin in hand,&#10;ran out and touched it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Oh, Evelyn &#8211; &#8220; the ladies cried.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Let her go,&#8221; said Mr. Worters tolerantly. &#8220;It certainly is a&#10;remarkable incident, remarkable. We must remember to tell the&#10;Archdeacon about it.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Harcourt,&#8221; she cried, with the first hint of returning color in&#10;her cheeks,&#8221;mightn&#8217;t&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;we go up to the copse after lunch, you and I?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Worters considered.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Of course, not if you don&#8217;t think best.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Inskip, what&#8217;s your opinion?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I saw what his own was, and cried, &#8220;Oh, let&#8217;s go!&#8221; though I&#10;detest the wind as much as anyone.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Very well. Mother, Anna, Ruth, Mrs. Osgood &#8211; we&#8217;ll all go.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And go we did, a lugubrious procession; but the gods were good&#10;to us for once, for as soon as we were started, the tempest&#10;dropped, and there ensued an extraordinary calm. After all, Miss&#10;Beaumont was something of a weather prophet. Her spirits improved&#10;every minute. She tripped in front of us along the asphalt path,&#10;and ever and anon turned round to say to her lover some gracious or&#10;alluring thing. I admired her for it. I admire people who know on&#10;which side their bread&#8217;s buttered.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Evelyn, come here!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Come here yourself.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Give me a kiss.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Come and take it then.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He ran after her, and she ran away, while all our party laughed&#10;melodiously.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Oh, I am so happy!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;I think I&#8217;ve everything I want&#10;in all the world. Oh dear, those last few days indoors! But oh, I&#10;am so happy now!&#8221; She had changed her brown dress for the old&#10;flowing green one, and she began to do her skirt dance in the open&#10;meadow, lit by sudden gleams of the sunshine. It was really a&#10;beautiful sight, and Mr. Worters did not correct her, glad perhaps&#10;that she should recover her spirits, even if she lost her tone. Her&#10;feet scarcely moved, but her body so swayed and her dress spread so&#10;gloriously around her, that we were transported with joy. She&#10;danced to the song of a bird that sang passionately in Other&#10;Kingdom, and the river held back its waves to watch her (one might&#10;have supposed), and the winds lay spell-bound in their cavern, and&#10;the great clouds spell-bound in the sky. She danced away from our&#10;society and our life, back, back, through the centuries till houses&#10;and fences fell and the earth lay wild to the sun. Her garment was&#10;as foliage upon her, the strength of her limbs as boughs, her&#10;throat the smooth upper branch that salutes the morning or glistens&#10;to the rain. Leaves move, leaves hide it as hers was hidden by the&#10;motion of her hair. Leaves move again and it is ours, as her throat&#10;was ours again when, parting the tangle, she faced us crying, &#8220;Oh!&#8221;&#10;crying, &#8220;Oh Harcourt! I never was so happy. I have all that there&#10;is in the world.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But he, untrammeled in love&#8217;s ecstasy, forgetting certain&#10;Madonnas of Raphael, forgetting, I fancy, his soul, sprang to inarm&#10;her with, &#8220;Evelyn! Eternal Bliss! Mine to eternity! Mine!&#8221; and she&#10;sprang away. Music was added and she sang, &#8220;Oh Ford! oh Ford, among&#10;all these Worters, I am coming through you to my Kingdom. Oh Ford,&#10;my lover while I was a woman, I will never forget you, never, as&#10;long as I have branches to shade you from the sun,&#8221; and, singing,&#10;crossed the stream.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Why he followed her so passionately, I do not know. It was play,&#10;she was in his own domain which a fence surrounds, and she could&#10;not possibly escape him. But he dashed round by the bridge as if&#10;all their love was at stake, and pursued her with fierceness up the&#10;hill. She ran well, but the end was a foregone conclusion, and we&#10;only speculated whether he would catch her outside or inside the&#10;copse. He gained on her inch by inch; now they were in the shadow&#10;of the trees; he had practically grasped her, he had missed; she&#10;had disappeared into the trees themselves, he following.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Harcourt is in high spirits,&#8221; said Mrs. Osgood, Anna, and&#10;Ruth.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Evelyn!&#8221; we heard him shouting within.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;We proceeded up the asphalt path.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Evelyn! Evelyn!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;He &#8216;s not caught her yet, evidently.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Where are you, Evelyn?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Miss Beaumont must have hidden herself rather cleverly.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Look here,&#8221; cried Harcourt, emerging, &#8220;have you seen&#10;Evelyn?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Oh, no, she&#8217;s certainly inside.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;So I thought.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Evelyn must be dodging round one of the trunks. You go this&#10;way, I that. We&#8217;ll soon find her.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;We searched, gaily at first, and always with a feeling that Miss&#10;Beaumont was close by, that the delicate limbs were just behind&#10;this bole, the hair and the drapery quivering among those leaves.&#10;She was beside us, above us; here was her footstep on the&#10;purple-brown earth &#8211; her bosom, her neck &#8211; she everywhere and&#10;nowhere. Gaiety turned to irritation, irritation to anger and fear.&#10;Miss Beaumont was apparently lost. &#8220;Evelyn! Evelyn!&#8221; we continued&#10;to cry. &#8220;Oh, really, it is beyond a joke.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then the wind arose, the more violent for its lull, and we were&#10;driven into the house by a terrific storm. We said, &#8220;At all events&#10;she will come back now.&#8221; But she did not come, and the rain hissed&#10;and rose up from the dry meadows like incense smoke, and smote the&#10;quivering leaves to applause. Then it lightened. Ladies screamed,&#10;and we saw Other Kingdom as one who claps the hands, and heard it&#10;as one who roars with laughter in the thunder. Not even the&#10;Archdeacon can remember such a storm. All Harcourt&#8217;s seedlings were&#10;ruined, and the tiles flew off his gables right and left. He came&#10;to me presently with a white, drawn face, saying: &#8220;Inskip, can I&#10;trust you?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;You can, indeed.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I have long suspected it; she has eloped with Ford.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;But how &#8211;&#8221; I gasped.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;The carriage is ready &#8211; we&#8217;ll talk as we drive.&#8221; Then, against&#10;the rain he shouted: &#8220;No gate in the fence, I know, but what about&#10;a ladder? While I blunder, she&#8217;s over the fence, and he &#8211;&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;But you were so close. There was not the time.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;There is time for anything,&#8221; he said venomously, &#8220;where a&#10;treacherous woman is concerned. I found her no better than a&#10;savage, I trained her, I educated her. But I&#8217;ll break them both. I&#10;can do that; I&#8217;ll break them soul and body.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;No one can break Ford now. The task is impossible. But I&#10;trembled for Miss Beaumont.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;We missed the train. Young couples had gone by it, several young&#10;couples, and we heard of more young couples in London, as if all&#10;the world were mocking Harcourt&#8217;s solitude. In desperation we&#10;sought the squalid suburb that is now Ford&#8217;s home. We swept past&#10;the dirty maid and the terrified aunt, swept upstairs, to catch him&#10;if we could red-handed. He was seated at the table, reading the&#10;&#338;dipus Coloneus of Sophocles.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;That won&#8217;t take in me!&#8221; shouted Harcourt. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got Miss&#10;Beaumont with you, and I know it.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;No such luck,&#8221; said Ford.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He stammered with rage. &#8220;Inskip &#8211; you hear that? &#8216;No such luck&#8217;!&#10;Quote the evidence against him. I can&#8217;t speak.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So I quoted her song. &#8220;&#8216;Oh Ford! Oh Ford, among all these&#10;Worters, I am coming through you to my Kingdom! Oh Ford, my lover&#10;while I was a woman, I will never forget you, never, as long as I&#10;have branches to shade you from the sun.&#8217; Soon after that, we lost&#10;her.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;And &#8211; and on another occasion she sent a message of similar&#10;effect. Inskip, bear witness. He was to &#8216;guess&#8217; something.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I have guessed it,&#8221; said Ford.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;So you practically &#8211;&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Oh, no, Mr. Worters, you mistake me. I have not practically&#10;guessed. I have guessed. I could tell you if I chose, but it would&#10;be no good, for she has not practically escaped you. She has&#10;escaped you absolutely, forever and ever, as long as there are&#10;branches to shade men from the sun.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 17, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4045', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('The Curate&#39;s Friend'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;It is uncertain how the Faun came to be in Wiltshire. Perhaps he&#10;came over with the Roman legionaries live with his friends in camp,&#10;talking to them of Lucretilis, or Garganus or of the slopes of&#10;Etna; they in the joy of their recall forgot to take him on board,&#10;and he wept in exile; but at last he found that our hills also&#10;understood his sorrows, and rejoiced when he was happy. Or, perhaps&#10;he came to be there because he had been there always. There is&#10;nothing particularly classical about a faun: it is only that the&#10;Greeks and Italians have ever had the sharpest eyes. You will find&#10;him in the &#8220;Tempest&#8221; and the &#8220;Benedicte&#8221; and in any country which&#10;has beech clumps and sloping grass and very clear streams may&#10;reasonably produce him&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;How I came to see him is a more difficult question. For to see&#10;him there is required a certain quality, for which truthfulness is&#10;too cold a name and animal spirits too coarse a one, and he alone&#10;knows how this quality came to be in me. No man has the right to&#10;call himself a fool, but I may say that I then presented the&#10;perfect semblance of one. I was facetious without humor and serious&#10;without conviction. Every Sunday I would speak to my rural&#10;parishioners about the other world in the tone of one who has been&#10;behind the scenes, or I would explain to them the errors of the&#10;Pelagians, or I would warn them against hurrying from one&#10;dissipation to another. Every Tuesday I gave what I called&#10;&#8220;straight talks to my lads&#8221; &#8211; talks which led straight past&#10;anything awkward. And every Thursday I addressed the Mothers&#8217; Union&#10;on the duties of wives or widows, and gave them practical hints on&#10;the management of a family often.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I took myself in, and for a time I certainly took in Emily. I&#10;have never known a girl attend so carefully to my sermons, or laugh&#10;so heartily at my jokes. It is no wonder that I became engaged. She&#10;has made an excellent wife, freely correcting her husband&#8217;s&#10;absurdities, but allowing no one else to breathe a word against&#10;them; able to talk about the subconscious self in the drawing-room,&#10;and yet have an ear for the children crying in the nursery, or the&#10;plates breaking in the scullery. An excellent wife &#8211; better than I&#10;ever imagined. But she has not married me.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Had we stopped indoors that afternoon nothing would have&#10;happened. It was all owing tot Emily&#8217;s mother, who insisted on our&#10;tea-ing out. Opposite the village, across the stream, was a small&#10;chalk down, crowned by a beech copse and a few Roman earthworks. (I&#10;lectured very vividly on those earthworks: they have since proved&#10;to be Saxon.) Hither did I drag up a tea-basket and a heavy rug for&#10;Emily&#8217;s mother, while Emily and a little friend went on in front.&#10;The little friend &#8211; who has played all through a much less&#10;important part than he supposes &#8211; a pleasant youth, full of&#10;intelligence and poetry, especially of what he called the poetry of&#10;earth. He longed to wrest earth&#8217;s secret from her, and I have seen&#10;him press his face passionately into the grass, even when he has&#10;believed himself to be alone. Emily was at that time full of vague&#10;aspirations, and, though I should have preferred them all to center&#10;in me, yet it seemed unreasonable to deny her such other&#10;opportunities for self-culture as the neighborhood provided.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was then my habit, on reaching the top of any eminence, to&#10;exclaim facetiously &#8220;And who will stand on either hand and keep the&#10;bridge with me?&#8221; at the same moment violently agitating my arms or&#10;casting my wide-awake at an imaginary foe. Emily and the&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;friend received my sally as usual, nor could I detect any&#10;insincerity in their mirth. Yet I was convinced that someone was&#10;present who did not think I had been funny, and any public speaker&#10;will understand my growing uneasiness.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I was somewhat cheered by Emily&#8217;s mother, who puffed up&#10;exclaiming, &#8220;Kind Harry, to carry the things! What should we do&#10;without you, even now! Oh, what a view! Can you see the dear&#10;Cathedral? No. Too hazy. Now I&#8217;m going to sit right on the rug.&#8221;&#10;She smiled mysteriously. &#8220;The downs in September, you know.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;We gave some perfunctory admiration to the landscape, which is&#10;indeed only beautiful to those who admire land, and to them perhaps&#10;the most beautiful in England. For here is the body of the great&#10;chalk spider who straddles over our island &#8211; whose legs are the&#10;south downs and the north downs and the Chilterns, and the tips of&#10;whose toes poke out at Cromer and Dover. He is a clean creature,&#10;who grows as few trees as he can, and those few in tidy clumps, and&#10;he loves to be tickled by quickly flowing streams. He is pimpled&#10;all over with earthworks, for from the beginning of time men have&#10;fought for the privilege of standing on him, and the oldest of our&#10;temples is built upon his back.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But in those days I liked my country snug and pretty, full of&#10;gentlemen&#8217;s residences and shady bowers and people who touch their&#10;hats. The expanses on which one may walk for miles and hardly shift&#10;a landmark or meet a genteel person were still intolerable to me. I&#10;turned away as soon as propriety allowed me and said &#8220;And may I now&#10;prepare the cup that cheers?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Emily&#8217;s mother replied: &#8220;Kind man, to help me. I always do say&#10;that tea out is worth the extra effort. I wish we led simpler&#10;lives.&#8221; We agreed with her. I spread out the food. &#8220;Won&#8217;t the&#10;kettle stand? Oh, but make it stand.&#8221; I did so. There was a little&#10;cry, faint but distinct, as of something in pain.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;How silent it all is up here!&#8221; said Emily.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I dropped a lighted match on the grass, and again I heard the&#10;little cry.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;What is that?&#8221; I asked.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I only said it was so silent,&#8221; said Emily.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Silent, indeed,&#8221; echoed the little friend. Silent! the place&#10;was full of noises. If the match had fallen in a drawing-room it&#10;could not have been worse, and the loudest noise came from beside&#10;Emily herself. I had exactly the sensation of going to a great&#10;party, of waiting to be announced in the echoing hall, where I&#10;could hear the voices of the guests, but could not yet see their&#10;faces. It is a nervous moment for a self-conscious man, especially&#10;if all the voices should be strange to him, and he has never met&#10;his host.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;My dear Harry!&#8221; said the elder lady, &#8220;never mind about that&#10;match. That&#8217;ll smolder away and harm no one. Tea-ee-ee&#38;#160;! I&#10;always say &#8211; and you will find Emily the same &#8211; that as the magic&#10;hour of five approaches, no matter how good a lunch, one begins to&#10;feel a sort of &#8211;&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now the Faun is of the kind who capers upon the Neo-Attic&#10;reliefs, and if you do not notice his ears or see his tail, you&#10;take him for a man and are horrified.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Bathing!&#8221; I cried wildly. &#8220;Such a thing for our village lads,&#10;but I quite agree &#8211; more supervision &#8211; I blame myself. Go away, bad&#10;boy, go away!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;What will he think of next!&#8221; said Emily, while the creature&#10;beside her stood up and beckoned to me. I advanced struggling and&#10;gesticulating with tiny steps and horrified cries, exorcising the&#10;apparition with my hat. Not otherwise had I advanced the day&#10;before, when Emily&#8217;s nieces showed me their guinea pigs. And by no&#10;less hearty laughter was I greeted now. Until the strange fingers&#10;closed upon me, I thought that here was one of my parishioners and&#10;did not cease to exclaim, &#8220;Let me go, naughty boy, let go!&#8221; And&#10;Emily&#8217;s mother, believing herself to have detected the joke,&#10;replied, &#8220;Well I must confess they are naughty boys and reach one&#10;even on the rug: the downs in September, as I said before.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Here I caught sight of the tail, uttered a wild shriek and fled&#10;into the beech copse behind.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Harry would have been a born actor,&#8221; said Emily&#8217;s mother as I&#10;left them.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I realized that a great crisis in my life was approaching, and&#10;that if I failed in it I might permanently lose my self-esteem.&#10;Already in the wood I was troubled by a multitude of voices &#8211; the&#10;voices of the hill beneath me, of the trees over my head, of the&#10;very insects in the bark of the tree. I could even hear the stream&#10;licking little pieces out of the meadows, and the meadows dreamily&#10;protesting. Above the din &#8211; which is no louder than the flight of a&#10;bee &#8211; rose the Faun&#8217;s voice saying, &#8220;Dear priest, be placid, be&#10;placid: why are you frightened?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I am not frightened,&#8221; said I &#8211; and indeed I was not.&#8221; But I am&#10;grieved: you have disgraced me in the presence of ladies.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;No one else has seen me,&#8221; he said, smiling idly. &#8220;The women&#10;have tight boots and the man has long hair. Those kinds never see.&#10;For years I have only spoken to children, and they lose sight of me&#10;as soon as they grow up. But you will not be able to lose sight of&#10;me, and until you die you will be my friend. Now I begin to make&#10;you happy: lie upon your back or run races, or climb trees, or&#10;shall I get you&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;blackberries, or harebells, or wives.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In a terrible voice I said to him, &#8220;Get thee behind me!&#8221; He got&#10;behind me. &#8220;Once for all,&#8221; I continued, &#8220;let me tell you that it is&#10;vain to tempt one whose happiness consists in giving happiness to&#10;others.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I cannot understand you,&#8221; he said ruefully. &#8220;What is to&#10;tempt?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Poor woodland creature!&#8221; said I, turning round. &#8220;How could you&#10;understand? It was idle of me to chide you. It is not in your&#10;little nature to comprehend a life of self-denial. Ah! if only I&#10;could reach you!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;You have reached him,&#8221; said the hill.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;If only I could touch you!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;You have touched him,&#8221; said the hill.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;But I will never leave you,&#8221; burst out the Faun. &#8220;I will sweep&#10;out your shrine for you, I will accompany you to the meetings of&#10;matrons. I will enrich you at the bazaars.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I shook my head. &#8220;For these things I care not at all. And indeed&#10;I was minded to reject your offer of service together. There I was&#10;wrong. You shall help me &#8211; you shall help me to make others&#10;happy.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Dear priest, what a curious life! People whom I have never seen&#10;&#8211; people who cannot see me &#8211; why should I make them happy?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;My poor lad &#8211; perhaps in time you will learn why. Now begone:&#10;commence. On this very hill sits a young lady for whom I have a&#10;high regard. Commence with her. Aha! your face falls. I thought as&#10;much. You cannot do anything. Here is the conclusion of the whole&#10;matter!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I can make her happy,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;if you order me! and when I&#10;have done so, perhaps you will trust me more.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Emily&#8217;s mother had started home, but Emily and the little friend&#10;still sat beside the tea-things &#8211; she in her white pique dress and&#10;biscuit straw, he in his rough but well-cut summer suit. The great&#10;pagan figure of the Faun towered insolently above them.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The friend was saying, &#8220;And have you never felt the appalling&#10;loneliness of a crowd?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;All that,&#8221; replied Emily, &#8220;have I felt, and very much&#10;more.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then the Faun laid his hands upon them. They, who had only&#10;intended a little cultured flirtation, resisted him as long as they&#10;could, but were gradually urged into each other&#8217;s arms, and&#10;embraced with passion.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Miscreant!&#8221; I shouted, bursting from the wood. &#8220;You have&#10;betrayed me.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I know it: I care not,&#8221; cried the little friend. &#8220;Stand aside.&#10;You are in the presence&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;of that which you do not understand. In the great solitude we&#10;have found ourselves at last.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Remove your accursed hands!&#8221; I shrieked to the Faun.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He obeyed and the little friend continued more calmly: &#8220;It is&#10;idle to chide. What should you know, poor clerical creature, of the&#10;mystery of love of the eternal man and the eternal woman, of the&#10;self-effectuation of a soul?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;That is true,&#8221; said Emily angrily. &#8220;Harry, you would never have&#10;made me happy. I shall treat you as a friend, but how could I give&#10;myself to a man who makes such silly jokes? When you played the&#10;buffoon at tea, your hour was sealed. I must be treated seriously:&#10;I must see infinities broadening around me as I rise. You may not&#10;approve of it, but so I am. In the great solitude I have found&#10;myself at last.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Wretched girl!&#8221; I cried. &#8220;Great solitude! O pair of helpless&#10;puppets &#8211;&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The little friend began to lead Emily away, but I heard her&#10;whisper to him: &#8220;Dear, we can&#8217;t possibly leave the basket for Harry&#10;after this: and mother&#8217;s rug; do you mind having that in the other&#10;hand?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So they departed and I flung myself upon the ground with every&#10;appearance of despair.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Does he cry?&#8221; said the Faun.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;He does not cry,&#8221; answered the hill. &#8220;His eyes are as dry as&#10;pebbles.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;My tormentor made me look at him. &#8220;I see happiness at the bottom&#10;of your heart,&#8221; said he.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I trust I have my secret springs,&#8221; I answered stiffly. And then&#10;I prepared a scathing denunciation, but of all the words I might&#10;have said, I only said one and it began with &#8220;D.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He gave a joyful cry, &#8220;Oh, now you really belong to us. To the&#10;end of your life you will swear when you are cross and laugh when&#10;you are happy. Now laugh!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There was a great silence. All nature stood waiting, while a&#10;curate tried to conceal his thoughts not only from nature but from&#10;himself. I thought of my injured pride, of my baffled&#10;unselfishness, of Emily, whom I was losing through no fault of her&#10;own, of the little friend, who just then slipped beneath the heavy&#10;tea basket, and that decided me, and I laughed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;That evening, for the first time, I heard the chalk downs&#10;singing to each other across the valleys, as they often do when the&#10;air is quiet and they have had a comfortable day. From my study&#10;window I could see the sunlit figure of the Faun, sitting before&#10;the beech copse as a man sits before his house. And as night came&#10;on I knew for certain that not only was he asleep, but that the&#10;hills and woods were asleep also. The stream, of course, never&#10;slept, any more than it ever freezes. Indeed, the hour of darkness&#10;is really the hour of water, which has been somewhat stifled all&#10;day by the great pulsings of the land. That is why you can feel it&#10;and hear it from a greater distance in the night, and why a bath&#10;after sundown is most wonderful.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The joy of that first evening is still clear in my memory, in&#10;spite of all the happy years that have followed. I remember it when&#10;I ascend my pulpit &#8211; I have a living now &#8211; and look down upon the&#10;best people sitting beneath me pew after pew, generous and&#10;contented, upon the worst people, crowded in the aisles, upon the&#10;whiskered tenors of the choir, and the high-browed curates and the&#10;church-wardens fingering their bags, and the supercilious vergers&#10;who turn latecomers from the door.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I remember it also when I sit in my comfortable bachelor&#10;rectory, amidst the carpet slippers that good young ladies I have&#10;worked for me, and the oak brackets that have been carved for me by&#10;good young men; amidst my phalanx of presentation teapots and my&#10;illuminated testimonials and all the other offerings of people who&#10;believe that I have given them a helping hand, and who really have&#10;helped me out of the mire themselves. And though I try to&#10;communicate that joy to others &#8211; as I try to communicate anything&#10;else that seems good &#8211; and though I sometimes succeed, yet I can&#10;tell no one exactly how it came to me. For if I breathed one word&#10;of that, my present life, so agreeable and profitable, would come&#10;to an end, my congregation would depart, and so should I, and&#10;instead of being an asset to my parish, I might find myself an&#10;expense to the nation. Therefore in the place of the lyrical and&#10;rhetorical treatment, so suitable to the subject, so congenial to&#10;my profession, I have been forced to use the unworthy medium of a&#10;narrative, and to delude you by declaring that this is a short&#10;story, suitable for reading in the train.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 17, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4045', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('The Road from Colonus'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;For no very intelligible reason, Mr. Lucas had hurried ahead of&#10;his party. He was perhaps reaching the age at which independence&#10;becomes valuable, because it is so soon to be lost. Tired of&#10;attention and consideration, he liked breaking away from the&#10;younger members, to ride by himself, and to dismount unassisted.&#10;Perhaps he also relished that more subtle pleasure of being kept&#10;waiting for lunch, and of telling the others on their arrival that&#10;it was of no consequence.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So, with childish impatience, he battered the animal&#8217;s sides&#10;with his heels, and made the muleteer bang it with a thick stick&#10;and prick it with a sharp one, and jolted down the hillsides&#10;through clumps of flowering shrubs and stretches of anemones and&#10;asphodel, till he heard the sound of running water, and came in&#10;sight of the group of plane trees where they were to have their&#10;meal.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Even in England those trees would have been remarkable, so huge&#10;were they, so interlaced, so magnificently clothed in quivering&#10;green. And here in Greece they were unique, the one cool spot in&#10;that hard brilliant landscape, already scorched by the heat of an&#10;April sun. In their midst was hidden a tiny Khan or country inn, a&#10;frail and mud building with a broad wooden balcony in which sat an&#10;old woman spinning, while a small brown pig, eating orange peel,&#10;stood beside her. On the wet earth below squatted two children,&#10;playing some primeval game with their fingers; and their mother,&#10;none too clean either, was messing with some rice inside. As Mrs.&#10;Forman would have said, it was all very Greek, and the fastidious&#10;Mr. Lucas felt thankful that they were bringing their own food with&#10;them, and should eat it in the open air.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Still, he was glad to be there &#8211; the muleteer had helped him off&#10;&#8211; and glad that Mrs. Forman was not there to forestall his opinions&#10;&#8211; glad even that he should not see Ethel for quite half an hour.&#10;Ethel was his youngest daughter, still unmarried. She was unselfish&#10;and affectionate, and it was generally understood that she was to&#10;devote her life to her father, and be the comfort of his old age.&#10;Mrs. Forman always referred to her as Antigone, and Mr. Lucas tried&#10;to settle down to the role of Oedipus, which seemed the only one&#10;that public opinion allowed him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He had this in common with Oedipus, that he was growing old.&#10;Even to himself it had become obvious. He had lost interest in&#10;other people&#8217;s affairs, and seldom attended when they spoke to him.&#10;He was fond of talking himself but often forgot what he was going&#10;to say, and even when he succeeded, it seldom seemed worth the&#10;effort. His phrases and gestures had become stiff and set, his&#10;anecdotes, once so successful, fell flat, his silence was as&#10;meaningless as his speech. Yet he had led a healthy, active life,&#10;had worked steadily, made money, educated his children. There was&#10;nothing and no one to blame: he was simply growing old.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At the present moment, here he was in Greece, and one of the&#10;dreams of his life was realized. Forty years ago he had caught the&#10;fever of Hellenism, and all his life he had felt that could he but&#10;visit that land, he would not have lived in vain. But Athens had&#10;been dusty, Delphi wet, Thermopylae flat, and he had listened with&#10;amazement and cynicism to the rapturous exclamations of his&#10;companions. Greece was like England: it was a man who was growing&#10;old, and it made no difference whether that man looked at the&#10;Thames or the Eurotas. It was his last hope of contradicting that&#10;logic of experience, and it was failing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Yet Greece had done something for him, though he did not know&#10;it. It had made him discontented, and there are stirrings of life&#10;in discontent. He knew that he was not the victim of continual&#10;ill-luck. Something great was wrong, and he was pitted against no&#10;mediocre or accidental enemy. For the last month a strange desire&#10;had possessed him to die fighting.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Greece is the land for young people,&#8221; he said to himself as he&#10;stood under the plane trees, &#8220;but I will enter into it, I will&#10;possess it. Leaves shall be green again, water shall be sweet, the&#10;sky shall be blue. They were so forty years ago, and I will win&#10;them back. I do mind being old, and I will pretend no longer.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He took two steps forward, and immediately cold waters were&#10;gurgling over his ankle.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Where does the water come from?&#8221; he asked himself. &#8220;I do not&#10;even know that.&#8221; He remembered that all the hillsides were dry; yet&#10;here the road was suddenly covered with flowing streams.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He stopped still in amazement, saying: &#8220;Water out of a tree &#8211;&#10;out of a hollow tree? I never saw nor thought of that before.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For the enormous plane that leant towards the Khan was hollow &#8211;&#10;it had been burnt out for charcoal &#8211; and from its living trunk&#10;there gushed an impetuous spring, coating the bark with fern and&#10;moss, and flowing over the mule track to create fertile meadows&#10;beyond. The simple country folk had paid to beauty and mystery such&#10;tribute as they could, for in the rind of the tree a shrine was&#10;cut, holding a lamp and a little picture of the Virgin, inheritor&#10;of the Naiad&#8217;s and Dryad&#8217;s joint abode.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I never saw anything so marvelous before,&#8221; said Mr. Lucas. &#8220;I&#10;could even step inside the trunk and see where the water comes&#10;from.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For a moment he hesitated to violate the shrine. Then he&#10;remembered with a smile his own thought &#8211; &#8220;the place shall be mine;&#10;I will enter it and possess it&#8221; &#8211; and leapt almost aggressively&#10;onto a stone within.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The water pressed up steadily and noiselessly from the hollow&#10;roots and hidden crevices of they plane, forming a wonderful amber&#10;pool ere it spilt over the lip of bark on to the earth outside. Mr.&#10;Lucas tasted it and it was sweet, and when he looked up the black&#10;funnel of the trunk he saw sky which was blue, and some leaves&#10;which were green; and he remembered, without smiling, another of&#10;his thoughts.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Others had been before him &#8211; indeed he had a curious sense of&#10;companionship. Little votive offerings to the presiding Power were&#10;fastened on to the bark &#8211; tiny arms and legs and eyes in tin,&#10;grotesque models of the brain or the heart &#8211; all tokens of some&#10;recovery of strength or wisdom or love. There was no such thing as&#10;the solitude of nature, for the sorrows and joys of humanity had&#10;pressed even into the bosom of a tree. He spread out his arms and&#10;steadied himself against the soft charred wood, and then slowly&#10;leant back, till his body was resting on the trunk behind. His eyes&#10;closed, and he had the strange feeling of one who is moving, yet at&#10;peace &#8211; the feeling of the swimmer, who, after long struggling with&#10;chopping seas, finds that after all the tide will sweep him to his&#10;goal.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So he lay motionless, conscious only of the stream below his&#10;feet, and that all things were a stream, in which he was&#10;moving.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He was aroused at last by a shock &#8211; the shock of an arrival&#10;perhaps, for when he opened his eyes, something unimagined,&#10;indefinable, had passed over all things, and made them intelligible&#10;and good.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There was meaning in the stoop of the old woman over her work,&#10;and in the quick motions of the little pig, and in her diminishing&#10;globe of wool. A young man came singing over the streams on a mule,&#10;and there was beauty in his pose and sincerity in his greeting. The&#10;sun made no accidental patterns upon the spreading roots of the&#10;trees, and there was intention in the nodding clumps of asphodel,&#10;and in the music of the water. To Mr. Lucas, who, in a brief space&#10;of time, had discovered not only Greece, but England and all the&#10;world and life, there seemed nothing ludicrous in the desire to&#10;hang within the tree another votive offering &#8211; a little model of an&#10;entire man.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Why, here&#8217;s papa, playing at being Merlin.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;All unnoticed they had arrived &#8211; Ethel, Mrs. Forman, Mr. Graham,&#10;and the English-speaking dragoman. Mr. Lucas peered out at them&#10;suspiciously. They had suddenly become unfamiliar, and all that&#10;they did seemed strained and coarse.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Allow me to give you a hand,&#8221; said Mr. Graham, a young man who&#10;was always polite to his elders.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Lucas felt annoyed. &#8220;Thank you, I can manage perfectly well&#10;by myself,&#8221; he replied. His foot slipped as he stepped out of the&#10;tree, and went into the spring.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Oh papa, my papa!&#8221; said Ethel, &#8220;what are you doing? Thank&#10;goodness I have got a change for you on the mule.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She tended him carefully, giving him clean socks and dry boots,&#10;and then sat him down on the rug beside the lunch basket, while she&#10;went with the others to explore the grove.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;They came back in ecstasies, in which Mr. Lucas tried to join.&#10;But he found them intolerable. Their enthusiasm was superficial,&#10;commonplace, and spasmodic. They had no perception of the coherent&#10;beauty that was flowering around them. He tried at least to explain&#10;his feelings, and what he said was:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I am altogether pleased with the appearance of this place. It&#10;impresses me very favorably. The trees are fine, remarkably fine&#10;for Greece, and there is something very poetic in the spring of&#10;clear running water. The people too seem kindly and civil. It is&#10;decidedly an attractive place.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mrs. Forman upbraided him for his tepid praise.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Oh, it is a place in a thousand!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;I could live and&#10;die here! I really would stop if I had not to be back at Athens! It&#10;reminds me of the Colonus of Sophocles.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Well, I must stop,&#8221; said Ethel. &#8220;I positively must.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Yes, do! You and your father! Antigone and Oedipus. Of course&#10;you must stop at Colonus!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Lucas was almost breathless with excitement. When he stood&#10;within the tree, he had believed that his happiness would be&#10;independent of locality. But these few minutes&#8217; conversation had&#10;undeceived him. He no longer trusted himself to journey through the&#10;world, for old thoughts, old wearinesses might be waiting to rejoin&#10;him as soon as he left the shade of the planes, and the music of&#10;the virgin water. To sleep in the Khan with the gracious, kind-eyed&#10;country people, to watch the bats flit about within the globe of&#10;shade, and see the moon turn the golden patterns into silver &#8211; one&#10;such night would place him beyond relapse, and confirm him forever,&#10;in the kingdom he had regained. But all his lips could say was: &#8220;I&#10;should be willing to put in a night here.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;You mean a week, papa! It would be sacrilege to put in&#10;less.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;A week then, a week,&#8221; said his lips, irritated at being&#10;corrected, while his heart was leaping with joy. All through lunch&#10;he spoke to them no more, but watched the place he should know so&#10;well, and the people who would so soon be his companions and&#10;friends. The inmates of the Khan only consisted of an old woman, a&#10;middle-aged woman, a young man and two children, and to none of&#10;them had he spoken, yet he loved them as he loved everything that&#10;moved or breathed or existed beneath the benedictory shade of the&#10;planes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;En route!&#8221; said the shrill voice of Mrs. Forman. &#8220;Ethel! Mr.&#10;Graham! The best of things must end.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Tonight,&#8221; thought Mr. Lucas, &#8220;they will light the little lamp&#10;by the shrine. And when we all sit together on the balcony, perhaps&#10;they will tell me which offerings they put up.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I beg your pardon, Mr. Lucas,&#8221; said Graham, &#8220;but they want to&#10;fold up the rug you are sitting on.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Lucas got up, saying to himself: &#8220;Ethel shall go to bed&#10;first, and then I will try to tell them about my offering too &#8211; for&#10;it is a thing I must do. I think they will understand if I am left&#10;with them alone.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Ethel touched him on the cheek. &#8220;Papa! I&#8217;ve called you three&#10;times. All the mules are here.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Mules? What mules?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Our mules. We&#8217;re all waiting. Oh, Mr. Graham, do help my father&#10;on.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about, Ethel.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;My dearest papa, we must start. You know we have to get to&#10;Olympia tonight.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Lucas in pompous, confident tones replied: &#8220;I always did&#10;wish, Ethel, that you had a better head for plans. You know&#10;perfectly well that we are putting in a week here. It is your own&#10;suggestion.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Ethel was startled into impoliteness. &#8220;What a perfectly&#10;ridiculous idea. You must have known I was joking. Of course I&#10;meant I wished we could.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Ah! if we could only do what we wished!&#8221; sighed Mrs. Forman,&#10;already seated on her mule.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Surely,&#8221; Ethel continued in calmer tones, &#8220;you didn&#8217;t think I&#10;meant it.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Most certainly I did. I have made all my plans on the&#10;supposition that we are stopping here, and it will be extremely&#10;inconvenient, indeed, impossible for me to start.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He delivered this remark with an air of great conviction, and&#10;Mrs. Forman and Mr. Graham had to turn away to hide their&#10;smiles&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I am sorry I spoke so carelessly; it was wrong of me. But, you&#10;know, we can&#8217;t break up our party, and even one night here would&#10;make us miss the boat at Patras.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mrs. Forman, in an aside, called Mr. Graham&#8217;s attention to the&#10;excellent way in which Ethel managed her father.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind about the Patras boat. You said that we should&#10;stop here, and we are stopping.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It seemed as if the inhabitants of the Khan had divined in some&#10;mysterious way that the altercation touched them. The old woman&#10;stopped her spinning, while the young man and the two children&#10;stood behind Mr. Lucas, as if supporting him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Neither arguments nor entreaties moved him. He said little, but&#10;he was absolutely determined, because for the first time he saw his&#10;daily life aright. What need had he to return to England? Who would&#10;miss him? His friends were dead or cold. Ethel loved him in a way,&#10;but, as was right, she had other interests. His other children he&#10;seldom saw. He had only one other relative, his sister Julia, whom&#10;he both feared and hated. It was no effort to struggle. He would be&#10;a fool as well as a coward if he stirred from the place which&#10;brought him happiness and peace.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At last Ethel, to humor him, and not disinclined to air her&#10;modern Greek, went into the Khan with the astonished dragoman to&#10;look at the rooms. The woman inside received them with loud&#10;welcomes, and the young man, when no one was looking, began to lead&#10;Mr. Lucas&#8217; mule to the stable.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Drop it, you brigand!&#8221; shouted Graham, who always declared that&#10;foreigners could understand English if they chose. He was right,&#10;for the man obeyed, and they all stood waiting for Ethel&#8217;s&#10;return.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She emerged at last, with close-gathered skirts, followed by the&#10;dragoman bearing the little pig, which he had bought at a&#10;bargain.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;My dear papa, I will do all I can for you, but stop in that&#10;Khan &#8211; no.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Are there &#8211; fleas?&#8221; asked Mrs. Forman.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Ethel intimated that &#8220;fleas&#8221; was not the word.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Well, I am afraid that settles it,&#8221; said Mrs. Forman, &#8220;I know&#10;how particular Mr. Lucas is.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;It does not settle it,&#8221; said Mr. Lucas. &#8220;Ethel, you go on. I do&#10;not want you. I don&#8217;t know why I ever consulted you. I shall stop&#10;here alone.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;That is absolute nonsense,&#8221; said Ethel, losing her temper. &#8220;How&#10;can you be left alone at your age? How would you get your meals or&#10;your bath? All your letters are waiting for you at Patras. You&#8217;ll&#10;miss the boat. That means missing the London operas, and upsetting&#10;all your engagements for the month. And as if you could travel by&#10;yourself!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;They might knife you,&#8221; was Mr. Graham&#8217;s contribution.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Greeks said nothing; but whenever Mr. Lucas looked their&#10;way, they beckoned him towards the Khan. The children would even&#10;have drawn him by the coat, and the old woman on the balcony&#10;stopped her almost completed spinning, and fixed him with&#10;mysterious appealing eyes. As he fought, the issue assumed gigantic&#10;proportions, and he believed that he was not merely stopping&#10;because he had regained youth or seen beauty or found happiness,&#10;but because in that place and with those people a supreme event was&#10;awaiting him which would transfigure the face of the world. The&#10;moment was so tremendous that he abandoned words and arguments as&#10;useless, and rested on the strength of his mighty unrevealed&#10;allies: silent men, murmuring water, and whispering trees. For the&#10;whole place called with one voice, articulate to him, and his&#10;garrulous opponents became every minute more meaningless and&#10;absurd. Soon they would be tired and go chattering away into the&#10;sun, leaving him to the cool grove and the moonlight and the&#10;destiny he foresaw.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mrs. Forman and the dragoman had indeed already started, amid&#10;the piercing screams of the little pig, and the struggle might have&#10;gone on indefinitely if Ethel had not called in Mr. Graham.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Can you help me?&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;He is absolutely&#10;unmanageable.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I&#8217;m no good at arguing &#8211; but if I could help you in any other&#10;way &#8211;&#8221; and he looked down complacently at his well-made figure.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Ethel hesitated. Then she said: &#8220;Help me in any way you can.&#10;After all, it is for his good that we do it.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Then have his mule led up behind him.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So when Mr. Lucas thought he had gained the day, he suddenly&#10;felt himself lifted off the ground, and set sideways on the saddle,&#10;and at the same time the mule started off at a trot. He said&#10;nothing, for he had nothing to say, and even his face showed little&#10;emotion as he felt the shade pass and heard the sound of the water&#10;cease. Mr. Graham was running at his side, hat in hand,&#10;apologizing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I know I had no business to do it, and I do beg your pardon&#10;awfully. But I do hope that someday you too will feel that I was &#8211;&#10;damn!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A stone had caught him in the middle of the back. It was thrown&#10;by the little boy, who was pursuing them along the mule track. He&#10;was followed by his sister, also throwing stones.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Ethel screamed to the dragoman, who was some way ahead with Mrs.&#10;Forman, but before he could rejoin them, another adversary&#10;appeared. It was the young Greek, who had cut them off in front,&#10;and now dashed down at Mr. Lucas&#8217; bridle. Fortunately Graham was an&#10;expert boxer, and it did not take him a moment to beat down the&#10;youth&#8217;s feeble defense, and to send him sprawling with a bleeding&#10;mouth into the asphodel. By this time the dragoman bad arrived, the&#10;children, alarmed at the fate of their brother, had desisted, and&#10;the rescue party, if such it is to be considered, retired in&#10;disorder to the trees.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Little devils!&#8221; said Graham, laughing with triumph. &#8220;That&#8217;s the&#10;modern Greek all over. Your father meant money if he stopped, and&#10;they consider we were taking it out of their pocket.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Oh, they are terrible &#8211; simple savages! I don&#8217;t know how I&#10;shall ever thank you. You&#8217;ve saved my father.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I only hope you didn&#8217;t think me brutal&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Ethel with a little sigh. &#8220;I admire strength.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Meanwhile the cavalcade reformed, and Mr. Lucas, who, as Mrs.&#10;Forman said, bore his disappointment wonderfully well, was put&#10;comfortably on to his mule. They hurried up the opposite hillside,&#10;fearful of another attack, and it was not until they had left the&#10;eventful place far behind that Ethel found an opportunity to speak&#10;to her father and ask his pardon for the way she had treated&#10;him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;You seemed so different, dear father, and you quite frightened&#10;me. Now I feel that you are your old self again.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He did not answer, and she concluded that he was not unnaturally&#10;offended at her behavior.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;By one of those curious tricks of mountain scenery, the place&#10;they had left an hour before suddenly reappeared far below them.&#10;The Khan was hidden under the green dome, but in the open there&#10;still stood three figures, and through the pure air rose up a faint&#10;cry of defiance or farewell.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Lucas stopped irresolutely, and let the reins fall from his&#10;hand.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Come, father dear,&#8221; said Ethel gently.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He obeyed, and in another moment a spur of the hill hid the&#10;dangerous scene forever.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;II.&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was breakfast time, but the gas was alight, owing to the fog.&#10;Mr. Lucas was in the middle of an account of a bad night he had&#10;spent. Ethel, who was to be married in a few weeks, had her arms on&#10;the table, listening.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;First the door bell rang, then you came back from the theater.&#10;Then the dog started, and after the dog the cat. And at three in&#10;the morning a young hooligan passed by singing. Oh yes: then there&#10;was the water gurgling in the pipe above my head.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;I think that was only the bath water running away,&#8221; said Ethel,&#10;looking rather worn.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s nothing I dislike more than running water. It&#8217;s&#10;perfectly impossible to sleep in the house. I shall give it up. I&#10;shall give notice next quarter. I shall tell the landlord plainly,&#10;&#8216;The reason I am giving up the house is this: it is perfectly&#10;impossible to sleep in it.&#8217; If he says &#8211; says &#8211; well, what has he&#10;got to say?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Some more toast, father?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Thank you, my dear.&#8221; He took it, and there was an interval of&#10;peace.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But he soon recommenced. &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to submit to the&#10;practicing next door as tamely as they think. I wrote and told&#10;there so &#8211; didn&#8217;t I?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;&#8216;Yes,&#8221; said Ethel, who had taken care that the letter should&#10;not reach. &#8220;I have seen the governess, and she has promised to&#10;arrange it differently. And Aunt Julia hates noise. It will be sure&#10;to be all right.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Her aunt, being the only unattached member of the family, was&#10;coming to keep house for her father when she left him. The&#10;reference was not a happy one, and Mr. Lucas commenced a series of&#10;half articulate sighs, which was only stopped by the arrival of the&#10;post.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Oh, what a parcel!&#8221; cried Ethel. &#8220;For me! What can it be! Greek&#10;stamps. This is most exciting!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It proved to be some asphodel bulbs, sent by Mrs. Forman from&#10;Athens for planting in the conservatory.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t it bring it all back! You remember the asphodels,&#10;father. And all wrapped up in Greek newspapers. I wonder if I can&#10;read them still, I used to be able to, you know.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She rattled on, hoping to conceal the laughter of the children&#10;next door &#8211; a favorite source of querulousness at breakfast&#10;time.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Listen to me! &#8216;A rural disaster.&#8217; Oh, I&#8217;ve hit on something&#10;sad. But never mind. &#8216;Last Tuesday at Plataniste, in the province&#10;of Messenia, a shocking tragedy occurred. A large tree&#8217; &#8211; aren&#8217;t I&#10;getting on well? &#8211; &#8216;blew down in the night and&#8217; &#8211; wait a minute &#8211;&#10;oh, dear!&#8217; crushed to death the five occupants of the little Khan&#10;there, who had apparently been sitting in the balcony. The bodies&#10;of Maria Rhomaides, the aged proprietress, and of her daughter,&#10;aged forty-six, were easily recognizable, whereas that of her&#10;grandson&#8217; &#8211; oh, the rest is really too horrid; I wish I had never&#10;tried it, and what&#8217;s more I feel to have heard the name Plataniste&#10;before. We didn&#8217;t stop there, did we, in the spring?&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;We had lunch,&#8221; said Mr. Lucas, with a faint expression of&#10;trouble on his vacant face. &#8220;Perhaps it was where the dragoman&#10;bought the pig.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said Ethel in a nervous voice. &#8220;Where the dragoman&#10;bought the little pig. How terrible!&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Very terrible!&#8221; said her father, whose attention was wandering&#10;to the noisy children next door. Ethel suddenly started to her feet&#10;with genuine interest.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Good gracious!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;This is an old paper. It&#10;happened not lately but in April &#8211; the night of Tuesday the&#10;eighteenth &#8211; and we &#8211; we must have been there in the&#10;afternoon.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;So we were,&#8221; said Mr. Lucas. She put her hand to her heart,&#10;scarcely able to speak.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#8220;Father, dear father, I must say it: you wanted to stop there.&#10;All those people, those poor half savage people, tried to keep you,&#10;they&#8217;re dead. The whole place, it says, is in ruins, and even the&#10;stream has changed its course. Father, dear, if it had not been for&#10;me, and if Arthur had not helped me, you must have been&#10;killed.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Lucas waved his hand irritably. &#8220;It is not a bit of good&#10;speaking to the governess, I shall write to the landlord and say,&#10;&#8216;The reason I am giving up the house is this: the dog barks, the&#10;children next door are intolerable, and I cannot stand the noise of&#10;running water.&#8217;&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Ethel did not check his babbling. She was aghast at the&#10;narrowness of the escape, and for a long time kept silence. At last&#10;she said: &#8220;Such a marvelous deliverance does make one believe in&#10;Providence.&#8221;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Mr. Lucas, who was still composing his letter to the landlord,&#10;did not reply.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 17, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4045', :deleted => 0)
