They&#10;had hastened to bring forth flowers before they got green leaves,&#10;and in the yard all the ducklings walked up and down, and the cat&#10;too: it basked in the sun and licked the sunshine from its own&#10;paws. And when one looked at the fields, how beautifully the corn&#10;stood and how green it shone, without comparison! and there was a&#10;twittering and a fluttering of all the little birds, as if the day&#10;were a great festival; and so it was, for it was Sunday. All the&#10;bells were ringing, and all the people went to church, looking&#10;cheerful, and dressed in their best clothes. There was a look of&#10;cheerfulness on everything. The day was so warm and beautiful that&#10;one might well have said: &#34;God&#39;s kindness to us men is beyond all&#10;limits.&#34; But inside the church the pastor stood in the pulpit, and&#10;spoke very loudly and angrily. He said that all men were wicked,&#10;and God would punish them for their sins, and that the wicked, when&#10;they died, would be cast into hell, to burn for ever and ever. He&#10;spoke very excitedly, saying that their evil propensities would not&#10;be destroyed, nor would the fire be extinguished, and they should&#10;never find rest. That was terrible to hear, and he said it in such&#10;a tone of conviction; he described hell to them as a miserable hole&#10;where all the refuse of the world gathers. There was no air beside&#10;the hot burning sulphur flame, and there was no ground under their&#10;feet; they, the wicked ones, sank deeper and deeper, while eternal&#10;silence surrounded them! It was dreadful to hear all that, for the&#10;preacher spoke from his heart, and all the people in the church&#10;were terrified. Meanwhile, the birds sang merrily outside, and the&#10;sun was shining so beautifully warm, it seemed as though every&#10;little flower said: &#34;God, Thy kindness towards us all is without&#10;limits.&#34; Indeed, outside it was not at all like the pastor&#39;s&#10;sermon.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The same evening, upon going to bed, the pastor noticed&#10;his wife sitting there quiet and pensive.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What is the matter with you?&#34; he asked her.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Well, the matter with me is,&#34; she said, &#34;that I cannot&#10;collect my thoughts, and am unable to grasp the meaning of what you&#10;said to-day in church&#8212;that there are so many wicked people, and&#10;that they should burn eternally. Alas! eternally&#8212;how long! I am&#10;only a woman and a sinner before God, but I should not have the&#10;heart to let even the worst sinner burn for ever, and how could our&#10;Lord to do so, who is so infinitely good, and who knows how the&#10;wickedness comes from without and within? No, I am unable to&#10;imagine that, although you say so.&#34;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was autumn; the trees dropped their leaves, the earnest&#10;and severe pastor sat at the bedside of a dying person. A pious,&#10;faithful soul closed her eyes for ever; she was the pastor&#39;s&#10;wife.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;If any one shall find rest in the grave and mercy before&#10;our Lord you shall certainly do so,&#34; said the pastor. He folded her&#10;hands and read a psalm over the dead woman.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;She was buried; two large tears rolled over the cheeks of&#10;the earnest man, and in the parsonage it was empty and still, for&#10;its sun had set for ever. She had gone home.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was night. A cold wind swept over the pastor&#39;s head; he&#10;opened his eyes, and it seemed to him as if the moon was shining&#10;into his room. It was not so, however; there was a being standing&#10;before his bed, and looking like the ghost of his deceased wife.&#10;She fixed her eyes upon him with such a kind and sad expression,&#10;just as if she wished to say something to him. The pastor raised&#10;himself in bed and stretched his arms towards her, saying, &#34;Not&#10;even you can find eternal rest! You suffer, you best and most pious&#10;woman?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The dead woman nodded her head as if to say &#34;Yes,&#34; and put&#10;her hand on her breast.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And can I not obtain rest in the grave for&#10;you?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes,&#34; was the answer.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And how?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Give me one hair&#8212;only one single hair&#8212;from the head of&#10;the sinner for whom the fire shall never be extinguished, of the&#10;sinner whom God will condemn to eternal punishment in&#10;hell.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, one ought to be able to redeem you so easily, you&#10;pure, pious woman,&#34; he said.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Follow me,&#34; said the dead woman. &#34;It is thus granted to&#10;us. By my side you will be able to fly wherever your thoughts wish&#10;to go. Invisible to men, we shall penetrate into their most secret&#10;chambers; but with sure hand you must find out him who is destined&#10;to eternal torture, and before the cock crows he must be found!&#34; As&#10;quickly as if carried by the winged thoughts they were in the great&#10;city, and from the walls the names of the deadly sins shone in&#10;flaming letters: pride, avarice, drunkenness, wantonness&#8212;in short,&#10;the whole seven-coloured bow of sin.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, therein, as I believed, as I knew it,&#34; said the&#10;pastor, &#34;are living those who are abandoned to the eternal fire.&#34;&#10;And they were standing before the magnificently illuminated gate;&#10;the broad steps were adorned with carpets and flowers, and dance&#10;music was sounding through the festive halls. A footman dressed in&#10;silk and velvet stood with a large silver-mounted rod near the&#10;entrance.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Our ball can compare favourably with the king&#39;s,&#34; he&#10;said, and turned with contempt towards the gazing crowd in the&#10;street. What he thought was sufficiently expressed in his features&#10;and movements: &#34;Miserable beggars, who are looking in, you are&#10;nothing in comparison to me.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Pride,&#34; said the dead woman; &#34;do you see him?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The footman?&#34; asked the pastor. &#34;He is but a poor fool,&#10;and not doomed to be tortured eternally by fire!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Only a fool!&#34; It sounded through the whole house of&#10;pride: they were all fools there.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then they flew within the four naked walls of the miser.&#10;Lean as a skeleton, trembling with cold, and hunger, the old man&#10;was clinging with all his thoughts to his money. They saw him jump&#10;up feverishly from his miserable couch and take a loose stone out&#10;of the wall; there lay gold coins in an old stocking. They saw him&#10;anxiously feeling over an old ragged coat in which pieces of gold&#10;were sewn, and his clammy fingers trembled.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;He is ill! That is madness&#8212;a joyless madness&#8212;besieged by&#10;fear and dreadful dreams!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;They quickly went away and came before the beds of the&#10;criminals; these unfortunate people slept side by side, in long&#10;rows. Like a ferocious animal, one of them rose out of his sleep&#10;and uttered a horrible cry, and gave his comrade a violent dig in&#10;the ribs with his pointed elbow, and this one turned round in his&#10;sleep:&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Be quiet, monster&#8212;sleep! This happens every&#10;night!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Every night!&#34; repeated the other. &#34;Yes, every night he&#10;comes and tortures me! In my violence I have done this and that. I&#10;was born with an evil mind, which has brought me hither for the&#10;second time; but if I have done wrong I suffer punishment for it.&#10;One thing, however, I have not yet confessed. When I came out a&#10;little while ago, and passed by the yard of my former master, evil&#10;thoughts rose within me when I remembered this and that. I struck a&#10;match a little bit on the wall; probably it came a little too close&#10;to the thatched roof. All burnt down&#8212;a great heat rose, such as&#10;sometimes overcomes me. I myself helped to rescue cattle and&#10;things, nothing alive burnt, except a flight of pigeons, which flew&#10;into the fire, and the yard dog, of which I had not thought; one&#10;could hear him howl out of the fire, and this howling I still hear&#10;when I wish to sleep; and when I have fallen asleep, the great&#10;rough dog comes and places himself upon me, and howls, presses, and&#10;tortures me. Now listen to what I tell you! You can snore; you are&#10;snoring the whole night, and I hardly a quarter of an hour!&#34; And&#10;the blood rose to the head of the excited criminal; he threw&#10;himself upon his comrade, and beat him with his clenced fist in the&#10;face.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Wicked Matz has become mad again!&#34; they said amongst&#10;themselves. The other criminals seized him, wrestled with him, and&#10;bent him double, so that his head rested between his knees, and&#10;they tied him, so that the blood almost came out of his eyes and&#10;out of all his pores.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You are killing the unfortunate man,&#34; said the pastor,&#10;and as he stretched out his hand to protect him who already&#10;suffered too much, the scene changed. They flew through rich halls&#10;and wretched hovels; wantonness and envy, all the deadly sins,&#10;passed before them. An angel of justice read their crimes and their&#10;defence; the latter was not a brilliant one, but it was read before&#10;God, Who reads the heart, Who knows everything, the wickedness that&#10;comes from within and from without, Who is mercy and love&#10;personified. The pastor&#39;s hand trembled; he dared not stretch it&#10;out, he did not venture to pull a hair out of the sinner&#39;s head.&#10;And tears gushed from his eyes like a stream of mercy and love, the&#10;cooling waters of which extinguished the eternal fire of&#10;hell.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Just then the cock crowed.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Father of all mercy, grant Thou to her the peace that I&#10;was unable to procure for her!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I have it now!&#34; said the dead woman. &#34;It was your hard&#10;words, your despair of mankind, your gloomy belief in God and His&#10;creation, which drove me to you. Learn to know mankind! Even in the&#10;wicked one lives a part of God&#8212;and this extinguishes and conquers&#10;the flame of hell!&#34;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The pastor felt a kiss on his lips; a gleam of light&#10;surrounded him&#8212;God&#39;s bright sun shone into the room, and his wife,&#10;alive, sweet and full of love, awoke him from a dream which God had&#10;sent him! &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)

Balsams and other flowers greet us from the&#10;long rows of windows in the house, whose interior is sufficiently&#10;poverty-stricken; and poor and old are the people who inhabit it.&#10;The building is the Warton Almshouse.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Look! at the window there leans an old maid. She plucks&#10;the withered leaf from the balsam, and looks at the grass-covered&#10;rampart, on which many children are playing. What is the old maid&#10;thinking of? A whole life drama is unfolding itself before her&#10;inward gaze.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The poor little children, how happy they are&#8212;how merrily&#10;they play and romp together! What red cheeks and what angels&#39; eyes!&#10;but they have no shoes nor stockings. They dance on the green&#10;rampart, just on the place where, according to the old story, the&#10;ground always sank in, and where a sportive, frolicsome child had&#10;been lured by means of flowers, toys and sweetmeats into an open&#10;grave ready dug for it, and which was afterwards closed over the&#10;child; and from that moment, the old story says, the ground gave&#10;way no longer, the mound remained firm and fast, and was quickly&#10;covered with the green turf. The little people who now play on that&#10;spot know nothing of the old tale, else would they fancy they heard&#10;a child crying deep below the earth, and the dewdrops on each blade&#10;of grass would be to them tears of woe. Nor do they know anything&#10;of the Danish King who here, in the face of the coming foe, took an&#10;oath before all his trembling courtiers that he would hold out with&#10;the citizens of his capital, and die here in his nest; they know&#10;nothing of the men who have fought here, or of the women who from&#10;here have drenched with boiling water the enemy, clad in white, and&#10;&#39;biding in the snow to surprise the city.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No! the poor little ones are playing with light, childish&#10;spirits. Play on, play on, thou little maiden! Soon the years will&#10;come&#8212;yes, those glorious years. The priestly hands have been laid&#10;on the candidates for confirmation; hand in hand they walk on the&#10;green rampart. Thou hast a white frock on; it has cost thy mother&#10;much labor, and yet it is only cut down for thee out of an old&#10;larger dress! You will also wear a red shawl; and what if it hang&#10;too far down? People will only see how large, how very large it is.&#10;You are thinking of your dress, and of the Giver of all good&#8212;so&#10;glorious is it to wander on the green rampart!&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And the years roll by; they have no lack of dark days,&#10;but you have your cheerful young spirit, and you have gained a&#10;friend&#8212;you know not how. You met, oh, how often! You walk together&#10;on the rampart in the fresh spring, on the high days and holidays,&#10;when all the world come out to walk upon the ramparts, and all the&#10;bells of the church steeples seem to be singing a song of praise&#10;for the coming spring.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Scarcely have the violets come forth, but there on the&#10;rampart, just opposite the beautiful Castle of Rosenberg, there is&#10;a tree bright with the first green buds. Every year this tree sends&#10;forth fresh green shoots. Alas! It is not so with the human heart!&#10;Dark mists, more in number than those that cover the northern&#10;skies, cloud the human heart. Poor child! thy friend&#39;s bridal&#10;chamber is a black coffin, and thou becomest an old maid. From the&#10;almshouse window, behind the balsams, thou shalt look on the merry&#10;children at play, and shalt see thine own history&#10;renewed.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And that is the life drama that passes before the old maid&#10;while she looks out upon the rampart, the green, sunny rampart,&#10;where the children, with their red cheeks and bare shoeless feet,&#10;are rejoicing merrily, like the other free little birds.&#10;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)

Then he gathers a large handful of&#10;flowers, which he carries up to the Almighty, that they may bloom&#10;more brightly in heaven than they do on earth. And the Almighty&#10;presses the flowers to His heart, but He kisses the flower that&#10;pleases Him best, and it receives a voice, and is able to join the&#10;song of the chorus of bliss.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;These words were spoken by an angel of God, as he carried&#10;a dead child up to heaven, and the child listened as if in a dream.&#10;Then they passed over well-known spots, where the little one had&#10;often played, and through beautiful gardens full of lovely&#10;flowers.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Which of these shall we take with us to heaven to be&#10;transplanted there?&#34; asked the angel.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Close by grew a slender, beautiful, rose-bush, but some&#10;wicked hand had broken the stem, and the half-opened rosebuds hung&#10;faded and withered on the trailing branches.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Poor rose-bush!&#34; said the child, &#34;let us take it with us&#10;to heaven, that it may bloom above in God&#39;s garden.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The angel took up the rose-bush; then he kissed the child,&#10;and the little one half opened his eyes. The angel gathered also&#10;some beautiful flowers, as well as a few humble buttercups and&#10;heart&#39;s-ease.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Now we have flowers enough,&#34; said the child; but the&#10;angel only nodded, he did not fly upward to heaven.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was night, and quite still in the great town. Here they&#10;remained, and the angel hovered over a small, narrow street, in&#10;which lay a large heap of straw, ashes, and sweepings from the&#10;houses of people who had removed. There lay fragments of plates,&#10;pieces of plaster, rags, old hats, and other rubbish not pleasant&#10;to see. Amidst all this confusion, the angel pointed to the pieces&#10;of a broken flower-pot, and to a lump of earth which had fallen out&#10;of it. The earth had been kept from falling to pieces by the roots&#10;of a withered field-flower, which had been thrown amongst the&#10;rubbish.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;We will take this with us,&#34; said the angel, &#34;I will tell&#10;you why as we fly along.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And as they flew the angel related the history.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Down in that narrow lane, in a low cellar, lived a poor&#10;sick boy; he had been afflicted from his childhood, and even in his&#10;best days he could just manage to walk up and down the room on&#10;crutches once or twice, but no more. During some days in summer,&#10;the sunbeams would lie on the floor of the cellar for about half an&#10;hour. In this spot the poor sick boy would sit warming himself in&#10;the sunshine, and watching the red blood through his delicate&#10;fingers as he held them before his face. Then he would say he had&#10;been out, yet he knew nothing of the green forest in its spring&#10;verdure, till a neighbor&#39;s son brought him a green bough from a&#10;beech-tree. This he would place over his head, and fancy that he&#10;was in the beech-wood while the sun shone, and the birds carolled&#10;gayly. One spring day the neighbor&#39;s boy brought him some&#10;field-flowers, and among them was one to which the root still&#10;adhered. This he carefully planted in a flower-pot, and placed in a&#10;window-seat near his bed. And the flower had been planted by a&#10;fortunate hand, for it grew, put forth fresh shoots, and blossomed&#10;every year. It became a splendid flower-garden to the sick boy, and&#10;his little treasure upon earth. He watered it, and cherished it,&#10;and took care it should have the benefit of every sunbeam that&#10;found its way into the cellar, from the earliest morning ray to the&#10;evening sunset. The flower entwined itself even in his dreams&#8212;for&#10;him it bloomed, for him spread its perfume. And it gladdened his&#10;eyes, and to the flower he turned, even in death, when the Lord&#10;called him. He has been one year with God. During that time the&#10;flower has stood in the window, withered and forgotten, till at&#10;length cast out among the sweepings into the street, on the day of&#10;the lodgers&#39; removal. And this poor flower, withered and faded as&#10;it is, we have added to our nosegay, because it gave more real joy&#10;than the most beautiful flower in the garden of a&#10;queen.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But how do you know all this?&#34; asked the child whom the&#10;angel was carrying to heaven.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I know it,&#34; said the angel, &#34;because I myself was the&#10;poor sick boy who walked upon crutches, and I know my own flower&#10;well.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the child opened his eyes and looked into the&#10;glorious happy face of the angel, and at the same moment they found&#10;themselves in that heavenly home where all is happiness and joy.&#10;And God pressed the dead child to His heart, and wings were given&#10;him so that he could fly with the angel, hand in hand. Then the&#10;Almighty pressed all the flowers to His heart; but He kissed the&#10;withered field-flower, and it received a voice. Then it joined in&#10;the song of the angels, who surrounded the throne, some near, and&#10;others in a distant circle, but all equally happy. They all joined&#10;in the chorus of praise, both great and small,&#8212;the good, happy&#10;child, and the poor field-flower, that once lay withered and cast&#10;away on a heap of rubbish in a narrow, dark street.&#10;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)

She had a little child, not at all pretty; so he was put out&#10;to be nursed by a laborer&#39;s wife, and his mother went to the&#10;count&#39;s castle. She sat in splendid rooms, richly decorated with&#10;silk and velvet; not a breath of air was allowed to blow upon her,&#10;and no one was allowed to speak to her harshly, for she was nurse&#10;to the count&#39;s child. He was fair and delicate as a prince, and&#10;beautiful as an angel; and how she loved this child! Her own boy&#10;was provided for by being at the laborer&#39;s where the mouth watered&#10;more frequently than the pot boiled, and where in general no one&#10;was at home to take care of the child. Then he would cry, but what&#10;nobody knows nobody cares for; so he would cry till he was tired,&#10;and then fall asleep; and while we are asleep we can feel neither&#10;hunger nor thirst. Ah, yes; sleep is a capital&#10;invention.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;As years went on, Anne Lisbeth&#39;s child grew apace like&#10;weeds, although they said his growth had been stunted. He had&#10;become quite a member of the family in which he dwelt; they&#10;received money to keep him, so that his mother got rid of him&#10;altogether. She had become quite a lady; she had a comfortable home&#10;of her own in the town; and out of doors, when she went for a walk,&#10;she wore a bonnet; but she never walked out to see the laborer:&#10;that was too far from the town, and, indeed, she had nothing to go&#10;for, the boy now belonged to these laboring people. He had food,&#10;and he could also do something towards earning his living; he took&#10;care of Mary&#39;s red cow, for he knew how to tend cattle and make&#10;himself useful.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The great dog by the yard gate of a nobleman&#39;s mansion&#10;sits proudly on the top of his kennel when the sun shines, and&#10;barks at every one that passes; but if it rains, he creeps into his&#10;house, and there he is warm and dry. Anne Lisbeth&#39;s boy also sat in&#10;the sunshine on the top of the fence, cutting out a little toy. If&#10;it was spring-time, he knew of three strawberry-plants in blossom,&#10;which would certainly bear fruit. This was his most hopeful&#10;thought, though it often came to nothing. And he had to sit out in&#10;the rain in the worst weather, and get wet to the skin, and let the&#10;cold wind dry the clothes on his back afterwards. If he went near&#10;the farmyard belonging to the count, he was pushed and knocked&#10;about, for the men and the maids said he was so horrible ugly; but&#10;he was used to all this, for nobody loved him. This was how the&#10;world treated Anne Lisbeth&#39;s boy, and how could it be otherwise. It&#10;was his fate to be beloved by no one. Hitherto he had been a land&#10;crab; the land at last cast him adrift. He went to sea in a&#10;wretched vessel, and sat at the helm, while the skipper sat over&#10;the grog-can. He was dirty and ugly, half-frozen and half-starved;&#10;he always looked as if he never had enough to eat, which was really&#10;the case.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Late in the autumn, when the weather was rough, windy, and&#10;wet, and the cold penetrated through the thickest clothing,&#10;especially at sea, a wretched boat went out to sea with only two&#10;men on board, or, more correctly, a man and a half, for it was the&#10;skipper and his boy. There had only been a kind of twilight all&#10;day, and it soon grew quite dark, and so bitterly cold, that the&#10;skipper took a dram to warm him. The bottle was old, and the glass&#10;too. It was perfect in the upper part, but the foot was broken off,&#10;and it had therefore been fixed upon a little carved block of wood,&#10;painted blue. A dram is a great comfort, and two are better still,&#10;thought the skipper, while the boy sat at the helm, which he held&#10;fast in his hard seamed hands. He was ugly, and his hair was&#10;matted, and he looked crippled and stunted; they called him the&#10;field-laborer&#39;s boy, though in the church register he was entered&#10;as Anne Lisbeth&#39;s son. The wind cut through the rigging, and the&#10;boat cut through the sea. The sails, filled by the wind, swelled&#10;out and carried them along in wild career. It was wet and rough&#10;above and below, and might still be worse. Hold! what is that? What&#10;has struck the boat? Was it a waterspout, or a heavy sea rolling&#10;suddenly upon them?&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Heaven help us!&#34; cried the boy at the helm, as the boat&#10;heeled over and lay on its beam ends. It had struck on a rock,&#10;which rose from the depths of the sea, and sank at once, like an&#10;old shoe in a puddle. &#34;It sank at once with mouse and man,&#34; as the&#10;saying is. There might have been mice on board, but only one man&#10;and a half, the skipper and the laborer&#39;s boy. No one saw it but&#10;the skimming sea-gulls and the fishes beneath the water; and even&#10;they did not see it properly, for they darted back with terror as&#10;the boat filled with water and sank. There it lay, scarcely a&#10;fathom below the surface, and those two were provided for, buried,&#10;and forgotten. The glass with the foot of blue wood was the only&#10;thing that did not sink, for the wood floated and the glass drifted&#10;away to be cast upon the shore and broken; where and when, is&#10;indeed of no consequence. It had served its purpose, and it had&#10;been loved, which Anne Lisbeth&#39;s boy had not been. But in heaven no&#10;soul will be able to say, &#34;Never loved.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Anne Lisbeth had now lived in the town many years; she was&#10;called &#34;Madame,&#34; and felt dignified in consequence; she remembered&#10;the old, noble days, in which she had driven in the carriage, and&#10;had associated with countess and baroness. Her beautiful, noble&#10;child had been a dear angel, and possessed the kindest heart; he&#10;had loved her so much, and she had loved him in return; they had&#10;kissed and loved each other, and the boy had been her joy, her&#10;second life. Now he was fourteen years of age, tall, handsome, and&#10;clever. She had not seen him since she carried him in her arms;&#10;neither had she been for years to the count&#39;s palace; it was quite&#10;a journey thither from the town.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I must make one effort to go,&#34; said Anne Lisbeth, &#34;to see&#10;my darling, the count&#39;s sweet child, and press him to my heart.&#10;Certainly he must long to see me, too, the young count; no doubt he&#10;thinks of me and loves me, as in those days when he would fling his&#10;angel-arms round my neck, and lisp &#39;Anne Liz.&#39; It was music to my&#10;ears. Yes, I must make an effort to see him again.&#34; She drove&#10;across the country in a grazier&#39;s cart, and then got out, and&#10;continued her journey on foot, and thus reached the count&#39;s castle.&#10;It was as great and magnificent as it had always been, and the&#10;garden looked the same as ever; all the servants were strangers to&#10;her, not one of them knew Anne Lisbeth, nor of what consequence she&#10;had once been there; but she felt sure the countess would soon let&#10;them know it, and her darling boy, too: how she longed to see&#10;him!&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Now that Anne Lisbeth was at her journey&#39;s end, she was&#10;kept waiting a long time; and for those who wait, time passes&#10;slowly. But before the great people went in to dinner, she was&#10;called in and spoken to very graciously. She was to go in again&#10;after dinner, and then she would see her sweet boy once more. How&#10;tall, and slender, and thin he had grown; but the eyes and the&#10;sweet angel mouth were still beautiful. He looked at her, but he&#10;did not speak, he certainly did not know who she was. He turned&#10;round and was going away, but she seized his hand and pressed it to&#10;her lips.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Well, well,&#34; he said; and with that he walked out of the&#10;room. He who filled her every thought! he whom she loved best, and&#10;who was her whole earthly pride!&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Anne Lisbeth went forth from the castle into the public&#10;road, feeling mournful and sad; he whom she had nursed day and&#10;night, and even now carried about in her dreams, had been cold and&#10;strange, and had not a word or thought respecting her. A great&#10;black raven darted down in front of her on the high road, and&#10;croaked dismally.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ah,&#34; said she, &#34;what bird of ill omen art thou?&#34;&#10;Presently she passed the laborer&#39;s hut; his wife stood at the door,&#10;and the two women spoke to each other.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You look well,&#34; said the woman; &#34;you&#39;re fat and plump;&#10;you are well off.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh yes,&#34; answered Anne Lisbeth.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The boat went down with them,&#34; continued the woman; &#34;Hans&#10;the skipper and the boy were both drowned; so there&#39;s an end of&#10;them. I always thought the boy would be able to help me with a few&#10;dollars. He&#39;ll never cost you anything more, Anne&#10;Lisbeth.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;So they were drowned,&#34; repeated Anne Lisbeth; but she&#10;said no more, and the subject was dropped. She felt very&#10;low-spirited, because her count-child had shown no inclination to&#10;speak to her who loved him so well, and who had travelled so far to&#10;see him. The journey had cost money too, and she had derived no&#10;great pleasure from it. Still she said not a word of all this; she&#10;could not relieve her heart by telling the laborer&#39;s wife, lest the&#10;latter should think she did not enjoy her former position at the&#10;castle. Then the raven flew over her, screaming again as he&#10;flew.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The black wretch!&#34; said Anne Lisbeth, &#34;he will end by&#10;frightening me today.&#34; She had brought coffee and chicory with her,&#10;for she thought it would be a charity to the poor woman to give&#10;them to her to boil a cup of coffee, and then she would take a cup&#10;herself.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The woman prepared the coffee, and in the meantime Anne&#10;Lisbeth seated her in a chair and fell asleep. Then she dreamed of&#10;something which she had never dreamed before; singularly enough she&#10;dreamed of her own child, who had wept and hungered in the&#10;laborer&#39;s hut, and had been knocked about in heat and in cold, and&#10;who was now lying in the depths of the sea, in a spot only known by&#10;God. She fancied she was still sitting in the hut, where the woman&#10;was busy preparing the coffee, for she could smell the&#10;coffee-berries roasting. But suddenly it seemed to her that there&#10;stood on the threshold a beautiful young form, as beautiful as the&#10;count&#39;s child, and this apparition said to her, &#34;The world is&#10;passing away; hold fast to me, for you are my mother after all; you&#10;have an angel in heaven, hold me fast;&#34; and the child-angel&#10;stretched out his hand and seized her. Then there was a terrible&#10;crash, as of a world crumbling to pieces, and the angel-child was&#10;rising from the earth, and holding her by the sleeve so tightly&#10;that she felt herself lifted from the ground; but, on the other&#10;hand, something heavy hung to her feet and dragged her down, and it&#10;seemed as if hundreds of women were clinging to her, and crying,&#10;&#34;If thou art to be saved, we must be saved too. Hold fast, hold&#10;fast.&#34; And then they all hung on her, but there were too many; and&#10;as they clung the sleeve was torn, and Anne Lisbeth fell down in&#10;horror, and awoke. Indeed she was on the point of falling over in&#10;reality with the chair on which she sat; but she was so startled&#10;and alarmed that she could not remember what she had dreamed, only&#10;that it was something very dreadful.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;They drank their coffee and had a chat together, and then&#10;Anne Lisbeth went away towards the little town where she was to&#10;meet the carrier, who was to drive her back to her own home. But&#10;when she came to him she found that he would not be ready to start&#10;till the evening of the next day. Then she began to think of the&#10;expense, and what the distance would be to walk. She remembered&#10;that the route by the sea-shore was two miles shorter than by the&#10;high road; and as the weather was clear, and there would be&#10;moonlight, she determined to make her way on foot, and to start at&#10;once, that she might reach home the next day.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The sun had set, and the evening bells sounded through the&#10;air from the tower of the village church, but to her it was not the&#10;bells, but the cry of the frogs in the marshes. Then they ceased,&#10;and all around became still; not a bird could be heard, they were&#10;all at rest, even the owl had not left her hiding place; deep&#10;silence reigned on the margin of the wood by the sea-shore. As Anne&#10;Lisbeth walked on she could hear her own footsteps in the sands;&#10;even the waves of the sea were at rest, and all in the deep waters&#10;had sunk into silence. There was quiet among the dead and the&#10;living in the deep sea. Anne Lisbeth walked on, thinking of nothing&#10;at all, as people say, or rather her thoughts wandered, but not&#10;away from her, for thought is never absent from us, it only&#10;slumbers. Many thoughts that have lain dormant are roused at the&#10;proper time, and begin to stir in the mind and the heart, and seem&#10;even to come upon us from above. It is written, that a good deed&#10;bears a blessing for its fruit; and it is also written, that the&#10;wages of sin is death. Much has been said and much written which we&#10;pass over or know nothing of. A light arises within us, and then&#10;forgotten things make themselves remembered; and thus it was with&#10;Anne Lisbeth. The germ of every vice and every virtue lies in our&#10;heart, in yours and in mine; they lie like little grains of seed,&#10;till a ray of sunshine, or the touch of an evil hand, or you turn&#10;the corner to the right or to the left, and the decision is made.&#10;The little seed is stirred, it swells and shoots up, and pours its&#10;sap into your blood, directing your course either for good or evil.&#10;Troublesome thoughts often exist in the mind, fermenting there,&#10;which are not realized by us while the senses are as it were&#10;slumbering; but still they are there. Anne Lisbeth walked on thus&#10;with her senses half asleep, but the thoughts were fermenting&#10;within her.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;From one Shrove Tuesday to another, much may occur to&#10;weigh down the heart; it is the reckoning of a whole year; much may&#10;be forgotten, sins against heaven in word and thought, sins against&#10;our neighbor, and against our own conscience. We are scarcely aware&#10;of their existence; and Anne Lisbeth did not think of any of her&#10;errors. She had committed no crime against the law of the land; she&#10;was an honorable person, in a good position&#8212;that she&#10;knew.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;She continued her walk along by the margin of the sea.&#10;What was it she saw lying there? An old hat; a man&#39;s hat. Now when&#10;might that have been washed overboard? She drew nearer, she stopped&#10;to look at the hat; &#34;Ha! what was lying yonder?&#34; She shuddered; yet&#10;it was nothing save a heap of grass and tangled seaweed flung&#10;across a long stone, but it looked like a corpse. Only tangled&#10;grass, and yet she was frightened at it. As she turned to walk&#10;away, much came into her mind that she had heard in her childhood:&#10;old superstitions of spectres by the sea-shore; of the ghosts of&#10;drowned but unburied people, whose corpses had been washed up on&#10;the desolate beach. The body, she knew, could do no harm to any&#10;one, but the spirit could pursue the lonely wanderer, attach itself&#10;to him, and demand to be carried to the churchyard, that it might&#10;rest in consecrated ground. &#34;Hold fast! hold fast!&#34; the spectre&#10;would cry; and as Anne Lisbeth murmured these words to herself, the&#10;whole of her dream was suddenly recalled to her memory, when the&#10;mother had clung to her, and uttered these words, when, amid the&#10;crashing of worlds, her sleeve had been torn, and she had slipped&#10;from the grasp of her child, who wanted to hold her up in that&#10;terrible hour. Her child, her own child, which she had never loved,&#10;lay now buried in the sea, and might rise up, like a spectre, from&#10;the waters, and cry, &#34;Hold fast; carry me to consecrated&#10;ground!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;As these thoughts passed through her mind, fear gave speed&#10;to her feet, so that she walked faster and faster. Fear came upon&#10;her as if a cold, clammy hand had been laid upon her heart, so that&#10;she almost fainted. As she looked across the sea, all there grew&#10;darker; a heavy mist came rolling onwards, and clung to bush and&#10;tree, distorting them into fantastic shapes. She turned and glanced&#10;at the moon, which had risen behind her. It looked like a pale,&#10;rayless surface, and a deadly weight seemed to hang upon her limbs.&#10;&#34;Hold,&#34; thought she; and then she turned round a second time to&#10;look at the moon. A white face appeared quite close to her, with a&#10;mist, hanging like a garment from its shoulders. &#34;Stop! carry me to&#10;consecrated earth,&#34; sounded in her ears, in strange, hollow tones.&#10;The sound did not come from frogs or ravens; she saw no sign of&#10;such creatures. &#34;A grave! dig me a grave!&#34; was repeated quite loud.&#10;Yes, it was indeed the spectre of her child. The child that lay&#10;beneath the ocean, and whose spirit could have no rest until it was&#10;carried to the churchyard, and until a grave had been dug for it in&#10;consecrated ground. She would go there at once, and there she would&#10;dig. She turned in the direction of the church, and the weight on&#10;her heart seemed to grow lighter, and even to vanish altogether;&#10;but when she turned to go home by the shortest way, it returned.&#10;&#34;Stop! stop!&#34; and the words came quite clear, though they were like&#10;the croak of a frog, or the wail of a bird. &#34;A grave! dig me a&#10;grave!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The mist was cold and damp, her hands and face were moist&#10;and clammy with horror, a heavy weight again seized her and clung&#10;to her, her mind became clear for thoughts that had never before&#10;been there.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In these northern regions, a beech-wood often buds in a&#10;single night and appears in the morning sunlight in its full glory&#10;of youthful green. So, in a single instant, can the consciousness&#10;of the sin that has been committed in thoughts, words, and actions&#10;of our past life, be unfolded to us. When once the conscience is&#10;awakened, it springs up in the heart spontaneously, and God awakens&#10;the conscience when we least expect it. Then we can find no excuse&#10;for ourselves; the deed is there and bears witness against us. The&#10;thoughts seem to become words, and to sound far out into the world.&#10;We are horrified at the thought of what we have carried within us,&#10;and at the consciousness that we have not overcome the evil which&#10;has its origin in thoughtlessness and pride. The heart conceals&#10;within itself the vices as well as the virtues, and they grow in&#10;the shallowest ground. Anne Lisbeth now experienced in thought what&#10;we have clothed in words. She was overpowered by them, and sank&#10;down and crept along for some distance on the ground. &#34;A grave! dig&#10;me a grave!&#34; sounded again in her ears, and she would have gladly&#10;buried herself, if in the grave she could have found forgetfulness&#10;of her actions.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was the first hour of her awakening, full of anguish&#10;and horror. Superstition made her alternately shudder with cold or&#10;burn with the heat of fever. Many things, of which she had feared&#10;even to speak, came into her mind. Silently, as the cloud-shadows&#10;in the moonshine, a spectral apparition flitted by her; she had&#10;heard of it before. Close by her galloped four snorting steeds,&#10;with fire flashing from their eyes and nostrils. They dragged a&#10;burning coach, and within it sat the wicked lord of the manor, who&#10;had ruled there a hundred years before. The legend says that every&#10;night, at twelve o&#39;clock, he drove into his castleyard and out&#10;again. He was not as pale as dead men are, but black as a coal. He&#10;nodded, and pointed to Anne Lisbeth, crying out, &#34;Hold fast! hold&#10;fast! and then you may ride again in a nobleman&#39;s carriage, and&#10;forget your child.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;She gathered herself up, and hastened to the churchyard;&#10;but black crosses and black ravens danced before her eyes, and she&#10;could not distinguish one from the other. The ravens croaked as the&#10;raven had done which she saw in the daytime, but now she understood&#10;what they said. &#34;I am the raven-mother; I am the raven-mother,&#34;&#10;each raven croaked, and Anne Lisbeth felt that the name also&#10;applied to her; and she fancied she should be transformed into a&#10;black bird, and have to cry as they cried, if she did not dig the&#10;grave. And she threw herself upon the earth, and with her hands dug&#10;a grave in the hard ground, so that the blood ran from her fingers.&#10;&#34;A grave! dig me a grave!&#34; still sounded in her ears; she was&#10;fearful that the cock might crow, and the first red streak appear&#10;in the east, before she had finished her work; and then she would&#10;be lost. And the cock crowed, and the day dawned in the east, and&#10;the grave was only half dug. An icy hand passed over her head and&#10;face, and down towards her heart. &#34;Only half a grave,&#34; a voice&#10;wailed, and fled away. Yes, it fled away over the sea; it was the&#10;ocean spectre; and, exhausted and overpowered, Anne Lisbeth sunk to&#10;the ground, and her senses left her.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was a bright day when she came to herself, and two men&#10;were raising her up; but she was not lying in the churchyard, but&#10;on the sea-shore, where she had dug a deep hole in the sand, and&#10;cut her hand with a piece of broken glass, whose sharp stern was&#10;stuck in a little block of painted wood. Anne Lisbeth was in a&#10;fever. Conscience had roused the memories of superstitions, and had&#10;so acted upon her mind, that she fancied she had only half a soul,&#10;and that her child had taken the other half down into the sea.&#10;Never would she be able to cling to the mercy of Heaven till she&#10;had recovered this other half which was now held fast in the deep&#10;water.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Anne Lisbeth returned to her home, but she was no longer&#10;the woman she had been. Her thoughts were like a confused, tangled&#10;skein; only one thread, only one thought was clear to her, namely&#10;that she must carry the spectre of the sea-shore to the churchyard,&#10;and dig a grave for him there; that by so doing she might win back&#10;her soul. Many a night she was missed from her home, and was always&#10;found on the sea-shore waiting for the spectre.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In this way a whole year passed; and then one night she&#10;vanished again, and was not to be found. The whole of the next day&#10;was spent in a useless search after her.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Towards evening, when the clerk entered the church to toll&#10;the vesper bell, he saw by the altar Anne Lisbeth, who had spent&#10;the whole day there. Her powers of body were almost exhausted, but&#10;her eyes flashed brightly, and on her cheeks was a rosy flush. The&#10;last rays of the setting sun shone upon her, and gleamed over the&#10;altar upon the shining clasps of the Bible, which lay open at the&#10;words of the prophet Joel, &#34;Rend your hearts and not your garments,&#10;and turn unto the Lord.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That was just a chance,&#34; people said; but do things&#10;happen by chance? In the face of Anne Lisbeth, lighted up by the&#10;evening sun, could be seen peace and rest. She said she was happy&#10;now, for she had conquered. The spectre of the shore, her own&#10;child, had come to her the night before, and had said to her, &#34;Thou&#10;hast dug me only half a grave: but thou hast now, for a year and a&#10;day, buried me altogether in thy heart, and it is there a mother&#10;can best hide her child!&#34; And then he gave her back her lost soul,&#10;and brought her into the church. &#34;Now I am in the house of God,&#34;&#10;she said, &#34;and in that house we are happy.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;When the sun set, Anne Lisbeth&#39;s soul had risen to that&#10;region where there is no more pain; and Anne Lisbeth&#39;s troubles&#10;were at an end. &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Conceited Apple-Branch'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;IT was the month of May. The wind still blew cold; but&#10;from bush and tree, field and flower, came the welcome sound,&#10;&#34;Spring is come.&#34; Wild-flowers in profusion covered the hedges.&#10;Under the little apple-tree, Spring seemed busy, and told his tale&#10;from one of the branches which hung fresh and blooming, and covered&#10;with delicate pink blossoms that were just ready to open. The&#10;branch well knew how beautiful it was; this knowledge exists as&#10;much in the leaf as in the blood; I was therefore not surprised&#10;when a nobleman&#39;s carriage, in which sat the young countess,&#10;stopped in the road just by. She said that an apple-branch was a&#10;most lovely object, and an emblem of spring in its most charming&#10;aspect. Then the branch was broken off for her, and she held it in&#10;her delicate hand, and sheltered it with her silk parasol. Then&#10;they drove to the castle, in which were lofty halls and splendid&#10;drawing-rooms. Pure white curtains fluttered before the open&#10;windows, and beautiful flowers stood in shining, transparent vases;&#10;and in one of them, which looked as if it had been cut out of newly&#10;fallen snow, the apple-branch was placed, among some fresh, light&#10;twigs of beech. It was a charming sight. Then the branch became&#10;proud, which was very much like human nature.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;People of every description entered the room, and,&#10;according to their position in society, so dared they to express&#10;their admiration. Some few said nothing, others expressed too much,&#10;and the apple-branch very soon got to understand that there was as&#10;much difference in the characters of human beings as in those of&#10;plants and flowers. Some are all for pomp and parade, others have a&#10;great deal to do to maintain their own importance, while the rest&#10;might be spared without much loss to society. So thought the&#10;apple-branch, as he stood before the open window, from which he&#10;could see out over gardens and fields, where there were flowers and&#10;plants enough for him to think and reflect upon; some rich and&#10;beautiful, some poor and humble indeed.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Poor, despised herbs,&#34; said the apple-branch; &#34;there is&#10;really a difference between them and such as I am. How unhappy they&#10;must be, if they can feel as those in my position do! There is a&#10;difference indeed, and so there ought to be, or we should all be&#10;equals.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the apple-branch looked with a sort of pity upon them,&#10;especially on a certain little flower that is found in fields and&#10;in ditches. No one bound these flowers together in a nosegay; they&#10;were too common; they were even known to grow between the&#10;paving-stones, shooting up everywhere, like bad weeds; and they&#10;bore the very ugly name of &#34;dog-flowers&#34; or&#10;&#34;dandelions.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Poor, despised plants,&#34; said the apple-bough, &#34;it is not&#10;your fault that you are so ugly, and that you have such an ugly&#10;name; but it is with plants as with men,&#8212;there must be a&#10;difference.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;A difference!&#34; cried the sunbeam, as he kissed the&#10;blooming apple-branch, and then kissed the yellow dandelion out in&#10;the fields. All were brothers, and the sunbeam kissed them&#8212;the poor&#10;flowers as well as the rich.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The apple-bough had never thought of the boundless love of&#10;God, which extends over all the works of creation, over everything&#10;which lives, and moves, and has its being in Him; he had never&#10;thought of the good and beautiful which are so often hidden, but&#10;can never remain forgotten by Him,&#8212;not only among the lower&#10;creation, but also among men. The sunbeam, the ray of light, knew&#10;better.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You do not see very far, nor very clearly,&#34; he said to&#10;the apple-branch. &#34;Which is the despised plant you so specially&#10;pity?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The dandelion,&#34; he replied. &#34;No one ever places it in a&#10;nosegay; it is often trodden under foot, there are so many of them;&#10;and when they run to seed, they have flowers like wool, which fly&#10;away in little pieces over the roads, and cling to the dresses of&#10;the people. They are only weeds; but of course there must be weeds.&#10;O, I am really very thankful that I was not made like one of these&#10;flowers.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;There came presently across the fields a whole group of&#10;children, the youngest of whom was so small that it had to be&#10;carried by the others; and when he was seated on the grass, among&#10;the yellow flowers, he laughed aloud with joy, kicked out his&#10;little legs, rolled about, plucked the yellow flowers, and kissed&#10;them in childlike innocence. The elder children broke off the&#10;flowers with long stems, bent the stalks one round the other, to&#10;form links, and made first a chain for the neck, then one to go&#10;across the shoulders, and hang down to the waist, and at last a&#10;wreath to wear round the head, so that they looked quite splendid&#10;in their garlands of green stems and golden flowers. But the eldest&#10;among them gathered carefully the faded flowers, on the stem of&#10;which was grouped together the seed, in the form of a white&#10;feathery coronal. These loose, airy wool-flowers are very&#10;beautiful, and look like fine snowy feathers or down. The children&#10;held them to their mouths, and tried to blow away the whole coronal&#10;with one puff of the breath. They had been told by their&#10;grandmothers that who ever did so would be sure to have new clothes&#10;before the end of the year. The despised flower was by this raised&#10;to the position of a prophet or foreteller of events.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Do you see,&#34; said the sunbeam, &#34;do you see the beauty of&#10;these flowers? do you see their powers of giving&#10;pleasure?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, to children,&#34; said the apple-bough.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;By-and-by an old woman came into the field, and, with a&#10;blunt knife without a handle, began to dig round the roots of some&#10;of the dandelion-plants, and pull them up. With some of these she&#10;intended to make tea for herself; but the rest she was going to&#10;sell to the chemist, and obtain some money.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But beauty is of higher value than all this,&#34; said the&#10;apple-tree branch; &#34;only the chosen ones can be admitted into the&#10;realms of the beautiful. There is a difference between plants, just&#10;as there is a difference between men.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the sunbeam spoke of the boundless love of God, as&#10;seen in creation, and over all that lives, and of the equal&#10;distribution of His gifts, both in time and in eternity.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That is your opinion,&#34; said the apple-bough.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then some people came into the room, and, among them, the&#10;young countess,&#8212;the lady who had placed the apple-bough in the&#10;transparent vase, so pleasantly beneath the rays of the sunlight.&#10;She carried in her hand something that seemed like a flower. The&#10;object was hidden by two or three great leaves, which covered it&#10;like a shield, so that no draught or gust of wind could injure it,&#10;and it was carried more carefully than the apple-branch had ever&#10;been. Very cautiously the large leaves were removed, and there&#10;appeared the feathery seed-crown of the despised dandelion. This&#10;was what the lady had so carefully plucked, and carried home so&#10;safely covered, so that not one of the delicate feathery arrows of&#10;which its mist-like shape was so lightly formed, should flutter&#10;away. She now drew it forth quite uninjured, and wondered at its&#10;beautiful form, and airy lightness, and singular construction, so&#10;soon to be blown away by the wind.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;See,&#34; she exclaimed, &#34;how wonderfully God has made this&#10;little flower. I will paint it with the apple-branch together.&#10;Every one admires the beauty of the apple-bough; but this humble&#10;flower has been endowed by Heaven with another kind of loveliness;&#10;and although they differ in appearance, both are the children of&#10;the realms of beauty.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the sunbeam kissed the lowly flower, and he kissed&#10;the blooming apple-branch, upon whose leaves appeared a rosy blush.&#10;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;Beauty of Form and Beauty of Mind'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;THERE was once a sculptor, named Alfred, who having won&#10;the large gold medal and obtained a travelling scholarship, went to&#10;Italy, and then came back to his native land. He was young at that&#10;time&#8212;indeed, he is young still, although he is ten years older than&#10;he was then. On his return, he went to visit one of the little&#10;towns in the island of Zealand. The whole town knew who the&#10;stranger was; and one of the richest men in the place gave a party&#10;in his honor, and all who were of any consequence, or who possessed&#10;some property, were invited. It was quite an event, and all the&#10;town knew of it, so that it was not necessary to announce it by&#10;beat of drum. Apprentice-boys, children of the poor, and even the&#10;poor people themselves, stood before the house, watching the&#10;lighted windows; and the watchman might easily fancy he was giving&#10;a party also, there were so many people in the streets. There was&#10;quite an air of festivity about it, and the house was full of it;&#10;for Mr. Alfred, the sculptor, was there. He talked and told&#10;anecdotes, and every one listened to him with pleasure, not&#10;unmingled with awe; but none felt so much respect for him as did&#10;the elderly widow of a naval officer. She seemed, so far as Mr.&#10;Alfred was concerned, to be like a piece of fresh blotting-paper&#10;that absorbed all he said and asked for more. She was very&#10;appreciative, and incredibly ignorant&#8212;a kind of female Gaspar&#10;Hauser.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I should like to see Rome,&#34; she said; &#34;it must be a&#10;lovely city, or so many foreigners would not be constantly arriving&#10;there. Now, do give me a description of Rome. How does the city&#10;look when you enter in at the gate?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I cannot very well describe it,&#34; said the sculptor; &#34;but&#10;you enter on a large open space, in the centre of which stands an&#10;obelisk, which is a thousand years old.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;An organist!&#34; exclaimed the lady, who had never heard the&#10;word &#39;obelisk.&#39; Several of the guests could scarcely forbear&#10;laughing, and the sculptor would have had some difficulty in&#10;keeping his countenance, but the smile on his lips faded away; for&#10;he caught sight of a pair of dark-blue eyes close by the side of&#10;the inquisitive lady. They belonged to her daughter; and surely no&#10;one who had such a daughter could be silly. The mother was like a&#10;fountain of questions; and the daughter, who listened but never&#10;spoke, might have passed for the beautiful maid of the fountain.&#10;How charming she was! She was a study for the sculptor to&#10;contemplate, but not to converse with; for she did not speak, or,&#10;at least, very seldom.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Has the pope a great family?&#34; inquired the&#10;lady.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The young man answered considerately, as if the question&#10;had been a different one, &#34;No; he does not come from a great&#10;family.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That is not what I asked,&#34; persisted the widow; &#34;I mean,&#10;has he a wife and children?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The pope is not allowed to marry,&#34; replied the&#10;gentleman.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I don&#39;t like that,&#34; was the lady&#39;s remark.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;She certainly might have asked more sensible questions;&#10;but if she had not been allowed to say just what she liked, would&#10;her daughter have been there, leaning so gracefully on her&#10;shoulder, and looking straight before her, with a smile that was&#10;almost mournful on her face?&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Mr. Alfred again spoke of Italy, and of the glorious&#10;colors in Italian scenery; the purple hills, the deep blue of the&#10;Mediterranean, the azure of southern skies, whose brightness and&#10;glory could only be surpassed in the north by the deep-blue eyes of&#10;a maiden; and he said this with a peculiar intonation; but she who&#10;should have understood his meaning looked quite unconscious of it,&#10;which also was charming.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Beautiful Italy!&#34; sighed some of the guests.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, to travel there!&#34; exclaimed others.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Charming! Charming!&#34; echoed from every voice.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I may perhaps win a hundred thousand dollars in the&#10;lottery,&#34; said the naval officer&#39;s widow; &#34;and if I do, we will&#10;travel&#8212;I and my daughter; and you, Mr. Alfred, must be our guide.&#10;We can all three travel together, with one or two more of our good&#10;friends.&#34; And she nodded in such a friendly way at the company,&#10;that each imagined himself to be the favored person who was to&#10;accompany them to Italy. &#34;Yes, we must go,&#34; she continued; &#34;but not&#10;to those parts where there are robbers. We will keep to Rome. In&#10;the public roads one is always safe.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The daughter sighed very gently; and how much there may be&#10;in a sigh, or attributed to it! The young man attributed a great&#10;deal of meaning to this sigh. Those deep-blue eyes, which had been&#10;lit up this evening in honor of him, must conceal treasures,&#10;treasures of heart and mind, richer than all the glories of Rome;&#10;and so when he left the party that night, he had lost it completely&#10;to the young lady. The house of the naval officer&#39;s widow was the&#10;one most constantly visited by Mr. Alfred, the sculptor. It was&#10;soon understood that his visits were not intended for that lady,&#10;though they were the persons who kept up the conversation. He came&#10;for the sake of the daughter. They called her Kaela. Her name was&#10;really Karen Malena, and these two names had been contracted into&#10;the one name Kaela. She was really beautiful; but some said she was&#10;rather dull, and slept late of a morning.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;She has been accustomed to that,&#34; her mother said. &#34;She&#10;is a beauty, and they are always easily tired. She does sleep&#10;rather late; but that makes her eyes so clear.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;What power seemed to lie in the depths of those dark eyes!&#10;The young man felt the truth of the proverb, &#34;Still waters run&#10;deep:&#34; and his heart had sunk into their depths. He often talked of&#10;his adventures, and the mamma was as simple and eager in her&#10;questions as on the first evening they met. It was a pleasure to&#10;hear Alfred describe anything. He showed them colored plates of&#10;Naples, and spoke of excursions to Mount Vesuvius, and the&#10;eruptions of fire from it. The naval officer&#39;s widow had never&#10;heard of them before.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Good heavens!&#34; she exclaimed. &#34;So that is a burning&#10;mountain; but is it not very dangerous to the people who live near&#10;it?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Whole cities have been destroyed,&#34; he replied; &#34;for&#10;instance, Herculaneum and Pompeii.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, the poor people! And you saw all that with your own&#10;eyes?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No; I did not see any of the eruptions which are&#10;represented in those pictures; but I will show you a sketch of my&#10;own, which represents an eruption I once saw.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;He placed a pencil sketch on the table; and mamma, who had&#10;been over-powered with the appearance of the colored plates, threw&#10;a glance at the pale drawing and cried in astonishment, &#34;What, did&#10;you see it throw up white fire?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;For a moment, Alfred&#39;s respect for Kaela&#39;s mamma underwent&#10;a sudden shock, and lessened considerably; but, dazzled by the&#10;light which surrounded Kaela, he soon found it quite natural that&#10;the old lady should have no eye for color. After all, it was of&#10;very little consequence; for Kaela&#39;s mamma had the best of all&#10;possessions; namely, Kaela herself.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Alfred and Kaela were betrothed, which was a very natural&#10;result; and the betrothal was announced in the newspaper of the&#10;little town. Mama purchased thirty copies of the paper, that she&#10;might cut out the paragraph and send it to friends and&#10;acquaintances. The betrothed pair were very happy, and the mother&#10;was happy too. She said it seemed like connecting herself with&#10;Thorwalsden.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You are a true successor of Thorwalsden,&#34; she said to&#10;Alfred; and it seemed to him as if, in this instance, mamma had&#10;said a clever thing. Kaela was silent; but her eyes shone, her lips&#10;smiled, every movement was graceful,&#8212;in fact, she was beautiful;&#10;that cannot be repeated too often. Alfred decided to take a bust of&#10;Kaela as well as of her mother. They sat to him accordingly, and&#10;saw how he moulded and formed the soft clay with his&#10;fingers.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I suppose it is only on our account that you perform this&#10;common-place work yourself, instead of leaving it to your servant&#10;to do all that sticking together.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It is really necessary that I should mould the clay&#10;myself,&#34; he replied.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ah, yes, you are always so polite,&#34; said mamma, with a&#10;smile; and Kaela silently pressed his hand, all soiled as it was&#10;with the clay.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then he unfolded to them both the beauties of Nature, in&#10;all her works; he pointed out to them how, in the scale of&#10;creation, inanimate matter was inferior to animate nature; the&#10;plant above the mineral, the animal above the plant, and man above&#10;them all. He strove to show them how the beauty of the mind could&#10;be displayed in the outward form, and that it was the sculptor&#39;s&#10;task to seize upon that beauty of expression, and produce it in his&#10;works. Kaela stood silent, but nodded in approbation of what he&#10;said, while mamma-in-law made the following confession:&#8212;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It is difficult to follow you; but I go hobbling along&#10;after you with my thoughts, though what you say makes my head whirl&#10;round and round. Still I contrive to lay hold on some of&#10;it.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Kaela&#39;s beauty had a firm hold on Alfred; it filled his&#10;soul, and held a mastery over him. Beauty beamed from Kaela&#39;s every&#10;feature, glittered in her eyes, lurked in the corners of her mouth,&#10;and pervaded every movement of her agile fingers. Alfred, the&#10;sculptor, saw this. He spoke only to her, thought only of her, and&#10;the two became one; and so it may be said she spoke much, for he&#10;was always talking to her; and he and she were one. Such was the&#10;betrothal, and then came the wedding, with bride&#39;s-maids and&#10;wedding presents, all duly mentioned in the wedding speech.&#10;Mamma-in-law had set up Thorwalsden&#39;s bust at the end of the table,&#10;attired in a dressing-gown; it was her fancy that he should be a&#10;guest. Songs were sung, and cheers given; for it was a gay wedding,&#10;and they were a handsome pair. &#34;Pygmalion loved his Galatea,&#34; said&#10;one of the songs.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ah, that is some of your mythologies,&#34; said&#10;mamma-in-law.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Next day the youthful pair started for Copenhagen, where&#10;they were to live; mamma-in-law accompanied them, to attend to the&#10;&#34;coarse work,&#34; as she always called the domestic arrangements.&#10;Kaela looked like a doll in a doll&#39;s house, for everything was&#10;bright and new, and so fine. There they sat, all three; and as for&#10;Alfred, a proverb may describe his position&#8212;he looked like a swan&#10;amongst the geese. The magic of form had enchanted him; he had&#10;looked at the casket without caring to inquire what it contained,&#10;and that omission often brings the greatest unhappiness into&#10;married life. The casket may be injured, the gilding may fall off,&#10;and then the purchaser regrets his bargain.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In a large party it is very disagreeable to find a button&#10;giving way, with no studs at hand to fall back upon; but it is&#10;worse still in a large company to be conscious that your wife and&#10;mother-in-law are talking nonsense, and that you cannot depend upon&#10;yourself to produce a little ready wit to carry off the stupidity&#10;of the whole affair.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The young married pair often sat together hand in hand; he&#10;would talk, but she could only now and then let fall a word in the&#10;same melodious voice, the same bell-like tones. It was a mental&#10;relief when Sophy, one of her friends, came to pay them a visit.&#10;Sophy was not, pretty. She was, however, quite free from any&#10;physical deformity, although Kaela used to say she was a little&#10;crooked; but no eye, save an intimate acquaintance, would have&#10;noticed it. She was a very sensible girl, yet it never occurred to&#10;her that she might be a dangerous person in such a house. Her&#10;appearance created a new atmosphere in the doll&#39;s house, and air&#10;was really required, they all owned that. They felt the want of a&#10;change of air, and consequently the young couple and their mother&#10;travelled to Italy.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Thank heaven we are at home again within our own four&#10;walls,&#34; said mamma-in-law and daughter both, on their return after&#10;a year&#39;s absence.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;There is no real pleasure in travelling,&#34; said mamma; &#34;to&#10;tell the truth, it&#39;s very wearisome; I beg pardon for saying so. I&#10;was soon very tired of it, although I had my children with me; and,&#10;besides, it&#39;s very expensive work travelling, very expensive. And&#10;all those galleries one is expected to see, and the quantity of&#10;things you are obliged to run after! It must be done, for very&#10;shame; you are sure to be asked when you come back if you have seen&#10;everything, and will most likely be told that you&#39;ve omitted to see&#10;what was best worth seeing of all. I got tired at last of those&#10;endless Madonnas; I began to think I was turning into a Madonna&#10;myself.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And then the living, mamma,&#34; said Kaela.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, indeed,&#34; she replied, &#34;no such a thing as a&#10;respectable meat soup&#8212;their cookery is miserable stuff.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The journey had also tired Kaela; but she was always&#10;fatigued, that was the worst of it. So they sent for Sophy, and she&#10;was taken into the house to reside with them, and her presence&#10;there was a great advantage. Mamma-in-law acknowledged that Sophy&#10;was not only a clever housewife, but well-informed and&#10;accomplished, though that could hardly be expected in a person of&#10;her limited means. She was also a generous-hearted, faithful girl;&#10;she showed that thoroughly while Kaela lay sick, fading away. When&#10;the casket is everything, the casket should be strong, or else all&#10;is over. And all was over with the casket, for Kaela&#10;died.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;She was beautiful,&#34; said her mother; &#34;she was quite&#10;different from the beauties they call &#39;antiques,&#39; for they are so&#10;damaged. A beauty ought to be perfect, and Kaela was a perfect&#10;beauty.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Alfred wept, and mamma wept, and they both wore mourning.&#10;The black dress suited mamma very well, and she wore mourning the&#10;longest. She had also to experience another grief in seeing Alfred&#10;marry again, marry Sophy, who was nothing at all to look at. &#34;He&#39;s&#10;gone to the very extreme,&#34; said mamma-in-law; &#34;he has gone from the&#10;most beautiful to the ugliest, and he has forgotten his first wife.&#10;Men have no constancy. My husband was a very different man,&#8212;but&#10;then he died before me.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;Pygmalion loved his Galatea,&#39; was in the song they sung&#10;at my first wedding,&#34; said Alfred; &#34;I once fell in love with a&#10;beautiful statue, which awoke to life in my arms; but the kindred&#10;soul, which is a gift from heaven, the angel who can feel and&#10;sympathize with and elevate us, I have not found and won till now.&#10;You came, Sophy, not in the glory of outward beauty, though you are&#10;even fairer than is necessary. The chief thing still remains. You&#10;came to teach the sculptor that his work is but dust and clay only,&#10;an outward form made of a material that decays, and that what we&#10;should seek to obtain is the ethereal essence of mind and spirit.&#10;Poor Kaela! our life was but as a meeting by the way-side; in&#10;yonder world, where we shall know each other from a union of mind,&#10;we shall be but mere acquaintances.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That was not a loving speech,&#34; said Sophy, &#34;nor spoken&#10;like a Christian. In a future state, where there is neither&#10;marrying nor giving in marriage, but where, as you say, souls are&#10;attracted to each other by sympathy; there everything beautiful&#10;develops itself, and is raised to a higher state of existence: her&#10;soul will acquire such completeness that it may harmonize with&#10;yours, even more than mine, and you will then once more utter your&#10;first rapturous exclamation of your love, &#39;Beautiful, most&#10;beautiful!&#39;&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Beetle Who Went on His Travels'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;THERE was once an Emperor who had a horse shod with gold.&#10;He had a golden shoe on each foot, and why was this? He was a&#10;beautiful creature, with slender legs, bright, intelligent eyes,&#10;and a mane that hung down over his neck like a veil. He had carried&#10;his master through fire and smoke in the battle-field, with the&#10;bullets whistling round him; he had kicked and bitten, and taken&#10;part in the fight, when the enemy advanced; and, with his master on&#10;his back, he had dashed over the fallen foe, and saved the golden&#10;crown and the Emperor&#39;s life, which was of more value than the&#10;brightest gold. This is the reason of the Emperor&#39;s horse wearing&#10;golden shoes.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A beetle came creeping forth from the stable, where the&#10;farrier had been shoeing the horse. &#34;Great ones, first, of course,&#34;&#10;said he, &#34;and then the little ones; but size is not always a proof&#10;of greatness.&#34; He stretched out his thin leg as he&#10;spoke.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And pray what do you want?&#34; asked the farrier.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Golden shoes,&#34; replied the beetle.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Why, you must be out of your senses,&#34; cried the farrier.&#10;&#34;Golden shoes for you, indeed!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, certainly; golden shoes,&#34; replied the beetle. &#34;Am I&#10;not just as good as that great creature yonder, who is waited upon&#10;and brushed, and has food and drink placed before him? And don&#39;t I&#10;belong to the royal stables?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But why does the horse have golden shoes?&#34; asked the&#10;farrier; &#34;of course you understand the reason?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Understand! Well, I understand that it is a personal&#10;slight to me,&#34; cried the beetle. &#34;It is done to annoy me, so I&#10;intend to go out into the world and seek my fortune.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Go along with you,&#34; said the farrier.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You&#39;re a rude fellow,&#34; cried the beetle, as he walked out&#10;of the stable; and then he flew for a short distance, till he found&#10;himself in a beautiful flower-garden, all fragrant with roses and&#10;lavender. The lady-birds, with red and black shells on their backs,&#10;and delicate wings, were flying about, and one of them said, &#34;Is it&#10;not sweet and lovely here? Oh, how beautiful everything&#10;is.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I am accustomed to better things,&#34; said the beetle. &#34;Do&#10;you call this beautiful? Why, there is not even a dung-heap.&#34; Then&#10;he went on, and under the shadow of a large haystack he found a&#10;caterpillar crawling along. &#34;How beautiful this world is!&#34; said the&#10;caterpillar. &#34;The sun is so warm, I quite enjoy it. And soon I&#10;shall go to sleep, and die as they call it, but I shall wake up&#10;with beautiful wings to fly with, like a butterfly.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;How conceited you are!&#34; exclaimed the beetle. &#34;Fly about&#10;as a butterfly, indeed! what of that. I have come out of the&#10;Emperor&#39;s stable, and no one there, not even the Emperor&#39;s horse,&#10;who, in fact, wears my cast-off golden shoes, has any idea of&#10;flying, excepting myself. To have wings and fly! why, I can do that&#10;already;&#34; and so saying, he spread his wings and flew away. &#34;I&#10;don&#39;t want to be disgusted,&#34; he said to himself, &#34;and yet I can&#39;t&#10;help it.&#34; Soon after, he fell down upon an extensive lawn, and for&#10;a time pretended to sleep, but at last fell asleep in earnest.&#10;Suddenly a heavy shower of rain came falling from the clouds. The&#10;beetle woke up with the noise and would have been glad to creep&#10;into the earth for shelter, but he could not. He was tumbled over&#10;and over with the rain, sometimes swimming on his stomach and&#10;sometimes on his back; and as for flying, that was out of the&#10;question. He began to doubt whether he should escape with his life,&#10;so he remained, quietly lying where he was. After a while the&#10;weather cleared up a little, and the beetle was able to rub the&#10;water from his eyes, and look about him. He saw something gleaming,&#10;and he managed to make his way up to it. It was linen which had&#10;been laid to bleach on the grass. He crept into a fold of the damp&#10;linen, which certainly was not so comfortable a place to lie in as&#10;the warm stable, but there was nothing better, so he remained lying&#10;there for a whole day and night, and the rain kept on all the time.&#10;Towards morning he crept out of his hiding-place, feeling in a very&#10;bad temper with the climate. Two frogs were sitting on the linen,&#10;and their bright eyes actually glistened with pleasure.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Wonderful weather this,&#34; cried one of them, &#34;and so&#10;refreshing. This linen holds the water together so beautifully,&#10;that my hind legs quiver as if I were going to swim.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I should like to know,&#34; said another, &#34;If the swallow who&#10;flies so far in her many journeys to foreign lands, ever met with a&#10;better climate than this. What delicious moisture! It is as&#10;pleasant as lying in a wet ditch. I am sure any one who does not&#10;enjoy this has no love for his fatherland.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Have you ever been in the Emperor&#39;s stable?&#34; asked the&#10;beetle. &#34;There the moisture is warm and refreshing; that&#39;s the&#10;climate for me, but I could not take it with me on my travels. Is&#10;there not even a dunghill here in this garden, where a person of&#10;rank, like myself, could take up his abode and feel at home?&#34; But&#10;the frogs either did not or would not understand him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I never ask a question twice,&#34; said the beetle, after he&#10;had asked this one three times, and received no answer. Then he&#10;went on a little farther and stumbled against a piece of broken&#10;crockery-ware, which certainly ought not to have been lying there.&#10;But as it was there, it formed a good shelter against wind and&#10;weather to several families of earwigs who dwelt in it. Their&#10;requirements were not many, they were very sociable, and full of&#10;affection for their children, so much so that each mother&#10;considered her own child the most beautiful and clever of them&#10;all.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Our dear son has engaged himself,&#34; said one mother, &#34;dear&#10;innocent boy; his greatest ambition is that he may one day creep&#10;into a clergyman&#39;s ear. That is a very artless and loveable wish;&#10;and being engaged will keep him steady. What happiness for a&#10;mother!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Our son,&#34; said another, &#34;had scarcely crept out of the&#10;egg, when he was off on his travels. He is all life and spirits, I&#10;expect he will wear out his horns with running. How charming this&#10;is for a mother, is it not Mr. Beetle?&#34; for she knew the stranger&#10;by his horny coat.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You are both quite right,&#34; said he; so they begged him to&#10;walk in, that is to come as far as he could under the broken piece&#10;of earthenware.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Now you shall also see my little earwigs,&#34; said a third&#10;and a fourth mother, &#34;they are lovely little things, and highly&#10;amusing. They are never ill-behaved, except when they are&#10;uncomfortable in their inside, which unfortunately often happens at&#10;their age.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Thus each mother spoke of her baby, and their babies&#10;talked after their own fashion, and made use of the little nippers&#10;they have in their tails to nip the beard of the beetle.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;They are always busy about something, the little rogues,&#34;&#10;said the mother, beaming with maternal pride; but the beetle felt&#10;it a bore, and he therefore inquired the way to the nearest&#10;dung-heap.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That is quite out in the great world, on the other side&#10;of the ditch,&#34; answered an earwig, &#34;I hope none of my children will&#10;ever go so far, it would be the death of me.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But I shall try to get so far,&#34; said the beetle, and he&#10;walked off without taking any formal leave, which is considered a&#10;polite thing to do.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;When he arrived at the ditch, he met several friends, all&#10;them beetles; &#34;We live here,&#34; they said, &#34;and we are very&#10;comfortable. May we ask you to step down into this rich mud, you&#10;must be fatigued after your journey.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Certainly,&#34; said the beetle, &#34;I shall be most happy; I&#10;have been exposed to the rain, and have had to lie upon linen, and&#10;cleanliness is a thing that greatly exhausts me; I have also pains&#10;in one of my wings from standing in the draught under a piece of&#10;broken crockery. It is really quite refreshing to be with one&#39;s own&#10;kindred again.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Perhaps you came from a dung-heap,&#34; observed the oldest&#10;of them.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No, indeed, I came from a much grander place,&#34; replied&#10;the beetle; &#34;I came from the emperor&#39;s stable, where I was born,&#10;with golden shoes on my feet. I am travelling on a secret embassy,&#10;but you must not ask me any questions, for I cannot betray my&#10;secret.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the beetle stepped down into the rich mud, where sat&#10;three young-lady beetles, who tittered, because they did not know&#10;what to say.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;None of them are engaged yet,&#34; said their mother, and the&#10;beetle maidens tittered again, this time quite in&#10;confusion.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I have never seen greater beauties, even in the royal&#10;stables,&#34; exclaimed the beetle, who was now resting&#10;himself.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Don&#39;t spoil my girls,&#34; said the mother; &#34;and don&#39;t talk&#10;to them, pray, unless you have serious intentions.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But of course the beetle&#39;s intentions were serious, and&#10;after a while our friend was engaged. The mother gave them her&#10;blessing, and all the other beetles cried &#34;hurrah.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Immediately after the betrothal came the marriage, for&#10;there was no reason to delay. The following day passed very&#10;pleasantly, and the next was tolerably comfortable; but on the&#10;third it became necessary for him to think of getting food for his&#10;wife, and, perhaps, for children.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I have allowed myself to be taken in,&#34; said our beetle to&#10;himself, &#34;and now there&#39;s nothing to be done but to take them in,&#10;in return.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;No sooner said than done. Away he went, and stayed away&#10;all day and all night, and his wife remained behind a forsaken&#10;widow.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh,&#34; said the other beetles, &#34;this fellow that we have&#10;received into our family is nothing but a complete vagabond. He has&#10;gone away and left his wife a burden upon our hands.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Well, she can be unmarried again, and remain here with my&#10;other daughters,&#34; said the mother. &#34;Fie on the villain that forsook&#10;her!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the mean time the beetle, who had sailed across the&#10;ditch on a cabbage leaf, had been journeying on the other side. In&#10;the morning two persons came up to the ditch. When they saw him&#10;they took him up and turned him over and over, looking very learned&#10;all the time, especially one, who was a boy. &#34;Allah sees the black&#10;beetle in the black stone, and the black rock. Is not that written&#10;in the Koran?&#34; he asked.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then he translated the beetle&#39;s name into Latin, and said&#10;a great deal upon the creature&#39;s nature and history. The second&#10;person, who was older and a scholar, proposed to carry the beetle&#10;home, as they wanted just such good specimens as this. Our beetle&#10;considered this speech a great insult, so he flew suddenly out of&#10;the speaker&#39;s hand. His wings were dry now, so they carried him to&#10;a great distance, till at last he reached a hothouse, where a sash&#10;of the glass roof was partly open, so he quietly slipped in and&#10;buried himself in the warm earth. &#34;It is very comfortable here,&#34; he&#10;said to himself, and soon after fell asleep. Then he dreamed that&#10;the emperor&#39;s horse was dying, and had left him his golden shoes,&#10;and also promised that he should have two more. All this was very&#10;delightful, and when the beetle woke up he crept forth and looked&#10;around him. What a splendid place the hothouse was! At the back,&#10;large palm-trees were growing; and the sunlight made the&#10;leaves&#8212;look quite glossy; and beneath them what a profusion of&#10;luxuriant green, and of flowers red like flame, yellow as amber, or&#10;white as new-fallen snow! &#34;What a wonderful quantity of plants,&#34;&#10;cried the beetle; &#34;how good they will taste when they are decayed!&#10;This is a capital store-room. There must certainly be some&#10;relations of mine living here; I will just see if I can find any&#10;one with whom I can associate. I&#39;m proud, certainly; but I&#39;m also&#10;proud of being so. Then he prowled about in the earth, and thought&#10;what a pleasant dream that was about the dying horse, and the&#10;golden shoes he had inherited. Suddenly a hand seized the beetle,&#10;and squeezed him, and turned him round and round. The gardener&#39;s&#10;little son and his playfellow had come into the hothouse, and,&#10;seeing the beetle, wanted to have some fun with him. First, he was&#10;wrapped, in a vine-leaf, and put into a warm trousers&#39; pocket. He&#10;twisted and turned about with all his might, but he got a good&#10;squeeze from the boy&#39;s hand, as a hint for him to keep quiet. Then&#10;the boy went quickly towards a lake that lay at the end of the&#10;garden. Here the beetle was put into an old broken wooden shoe, in&#10;which a little stick had been fastened upright for a mast, and to&#10;this mast the beetle was bound with a piece of worsted. Now he was&#10;a sailor, and had to sail away. The lake was not very large, but to&#10;the beetle it seemed an ocean, and he was so astonished at its size&#10;that he fell over on his back, and kicked out his legs. Then the&#10;little ship sailed away; sometimes the current of the water seized&#10;it, but whenever it went too far from the shore one of the boys&#10;turned up his trousers, and went in after it, and brought it back&#10;to land. But at last, just as it went merrily out again, the two&#10;boys were called, and so angrily, that they hastened to obey, and&#10;ran away as fast as they could from the pond, so that the little&#10;ship was left to its fate. It was carried away farther and farther&#10;from the shore, till it reached the open sea. This was a terrible&#10;prospect for the beetle, for he could not escape in consequence of&#10;being bound to the mast. Then a fly came and paid him a visit.&#10;&#34;What beautiful weather,&#34; said the fly; &#34;I shall rest here and sun&#10;myself. You must have a pleasant time of it.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You speak without knowing the facts,&#34; replied the beetle;&#10;&#34;don&#39;t you see that I am a prisoner?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ah, but I&#39;m not a prisoner,&#34; remarked the fly, and away&#10;he flew.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Well, now I know the world,&#34; said the beetle to himself;&#10;&#34;it&#39;s an abominable world; I&#39;m the only respectable person in it.&#10;First, they refuse me my golden shoes; then I have to lie on damp&#10;linen, and to stand in a draught; and to crown all, they fasten a&#10;wife upon me. Then, when I have made a step forward in the world,&#10;and found out a comfortable position, just as I could wish it to&#10;be, one of these human boys comes and ties me up, and leaves me to&#10;the mercy of the wild waves, while the emperor&#39;s favorite horse&#10;goes prancing about proudly on his golden shoes. This vexes me more&#10;than anything. But it is useless to look for sympathy in this&#10;world. My career has been very interesting, but what&#39;s the use of&#10;that if nobody knows anything about it? The world does not deserve&#10;to be made acquainted with my adventures, for it ought to have&#10;given me golden shoes when the emperor&#39;s horse was shod, and I&#10;stretched out my feet to be shod, too. If I had received golden&#10;shoes I should have been an ornament to the stable; now I am lost&#10;to the stable and to the world. It is all over with me.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But all was not yet over. A boat, in which were a few&#10;young girls, came rowing up. &#34;Look, yonder is an old wooden shoe&#10;sailing along,&#34; said one of the younger girls.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And there&#39;s a poor little creature bound fast in it,&#34;&#10;said another.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The boat now came close to our beetle&#39;s ship, and the&#10;young girls fished it out of the water. One of them drew a small&#10;pair of scissors from her pocket, and cut the worsted without&#10;hurting the beetle, and when she stepped on shore she placed him on&#10;the grass. &#34;There,&#34; she said, &#34;creep away, or fly, if thou canst.&#10;It is a splendid thing to have thy liberty.&#34; Away flew the beetle,&#10;straight through the open window of a large building; there he sank&#10;down, tired and exhausted, exactly on the mane of the emperor&#39;s&#10;favorite horse, who was standing in his stable; and the beetle&#10;found himself at home again. For some time he clung to the mane,&#10;that he might recover himself. &#34;Well,&#34; he said, &#34;here I am, seated&#10;on the emperor&#39;s favorite horse,&#8212;sitting upon him as if I were the&#10;emperor himself. But what was it the farrier asked me? Ah, I&#10;remember now,&#8212;that&#39;s a good thought,&#8212;he asked me why the golden&#10;shoes were given to the horse. The answer is quite clear to me,&#10;now. They were given to the horse on my account.&#34; And this&#10;reflection put the beetle into a good temper. The sun&#39;s rays also&#10;came streaming into the stable, and shone upon him, and made the&#10;place lively and bright. &#34;Travelling expands the mind very much,&#34;&#10;said the beetle. &#34;The world is not so bad after all, if you know&#10;how to take things as they come. &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Bell'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;IN the narrow streets of a large town people often heard&#10;in the evening, when the sun was setting, and his last rays gave a&#10;golden tint to the chimney-pots, a strange noise which resembled&#10;the sound of a church bell; it only lasted an instant, for it was&#10;lost in the continual roar of traffic and hum of voices which rose&#10;from the town. &#34;The evening bell is ringing,&#34; people used to say;&#10;&#34;the sun is setting!&#34; Those who walked outside the town, where the&#10;houses were less crowded and interspersed by gardens and little&#10;fields, saw the evening sky much better, and heard the sound of the&#10;bell much more clearly. It seemed as though the sound came from a&#10;church, deep in the calm, fragrant wood, and thither people looked&#10;with devout feelings.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A considerable time elapsed: one said to the other, &#34;I&#10;really wonder if there is a church out in the wood. The bell has&#10;indeed a strange sweet sound! Shall we go there and see what the&#10;cause of it is?&#34; The rich drove, the poor walked, but the way&#10;seemed to them extraordinarily long, and when they arrived at a&#10;number of willow trees on the border of the wood they sat down,&#10;looked up into the great branches and thought they were now really&#10;in the wood. A confectioner from the town also came out and put up&#10;a stall there; then came another confectioner who hung a bell over&#10;his stall, which was covered with pitch to protect it from the&#10;rain, but the clapper was wanting.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;When people came home they used to say that it had been&#10;very romantic, and that really means something else than merely&#10;taking tea. Three persons declared that they had gone as far as the&#10;end of the wood; they had always heard the strange sound, but there&#10;it seemed to them as if it came from the town. One of them wrote&#10;verses about the bell, and said that it was like the voice of a&#10;mother speaking to an intelligent and beloved child; no tune, he&#10;said, was sweeter than the sound of the bell.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The emperor of the country heard of it, and declared that&#10;he who would really find out where the sound came from should&#10;receive the title of &#34;Bellringer to the World,&#34; even if there was&#10;no bell at all.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Now many went out into the wood for the sake of this&#10;splendid berth; but only one of them came back with some sort of&#10;explanation. None of them had gone far enough, nor had he, and yet&#10;he said that the sound of the bell came from a large owl in a&#10;hollow tree. It was a wisdom owl, which continually knocked its&#10;head against the tree, but he was unable to say with certainty&#10;whether its head or the hollow trunk of the tree was the cause of&#10;the noise.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;He was appointed &#34;Bellringer to the World,&#34; and wrote&#10;every year a short dissertation on the owl, but by this means&#10;people did not become any wiser than they had been&#10;before.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was just confirmation-day. The clergyman had delivered&#10;a beautiful and touching sermon, the candidates were deeply moved&#10;by it; it was indeed a very important day for them; they were all&#10;at once transformed from mere children to grown-up people; the&#10;childish soul was to fly over, as it were, into a more reasonable&#10;being.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The sun shone most brightly; and the sound of the great&#10;unknown bell was heard more distinctly than ever. They had a mind&#10;to go thither, all except three. One of them wished to go home and&#10;try on her ball dress, for this very dress and the ball were the&#10;cause of her being confirmed this time, otherwise she would not&#10;have been allowed to go. The second, a poor boy, had borrowed a&#10;coat and a pair of boots from the son of his landlord to be&#10;confirmed in, and he had to return them at a certain time. The&#10;third said that he never went into strange places if his parents&#10;were not with him; he had always been a good child, and wished to&#10;remain so, even after being confirmed, and they ought not to tease&#10;him for this; they, however, did it all the same. These three,&#10;therefore did not go; the others went on. The sun was shining, the&#10;birds were singing, and the confirmed children sang too, holding&#10;each other by the hand, for they had no position yet, and they were&#10;all equal in the eyes of God. Two of the smallest soon became tired&#10;and returned to the town; two little girls sat down and made&#10;garlands of flowers, they, therefore, did not go on. When the&#10;others arrived at the willow trees, where the confectioner had put&#10;up his stall, they said: &#34;Now we are out here; the bell does not in&#10;reality exist&#8212;it is only something that people imagine!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then suddenly the sound of the bell was heard so&#10;beautifully and solemnly from the wood that four or five made up&#10;their minds to go still further on. The wood was very thickly&#10;grown. It was difficult to advance: wood lilies and anemones grew&#10;almost too high; flowering convolvuli and brambles were hanging&#10;like garlands from tree to tree; while the nightingales were&#10;singing and the sunbeams played. That was very beautiful! But the&#10;way was unfit for the girls; they would have torn their dresses.&#10;Large rocks, covered with moss of various hues, were lying about;&#10;the fresh spring water rippled forth with a peculiar sound. &#34;I&#10;don&#39;t think that can be the bell,&#34; said one of the confirmed&#10;children, and then he lay down and listened. &#34;We must try to find&#10;out if it is!&#34; And there he remained, and let the others walk&#10;on.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;They came to a hut built of the bark of trees and&#10;branches; a large crab-apple tree spread its branches over it, as&#10;if it intended to pour all its fruit on the roof, upon which roses&#10;were blooming; the long boughs covered the gable, where a little&#10;bell was hanging. Was this the one they had heard? All agreed that&#10;it must be so, except one who said that the bell was too small and&#10;too thin to be heard at such a distance, and that it had quite a&#10;different sound to that which had so touched men&#39;s&#10;hearts.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;He who spoke was a king&#39;s son, and therefore the others&#10;said that such a one always wishes to be cleverer than other&#10;people.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Therefore they let him go alone; and as he walked on, the&#10;solitude of the wood produced a feeling of reverence in his breast;&#10;but still he heard the little bell about which the others rejoiced,&#10;and sometimes, when the wind blew in that direction, he could hear&#10;the sounds from the confectioner&#39;s stall, where the others were&#10;singing at tea. But the deep sounds of the bell were much stronger;&#10;soon it seemed to him as if an organ played an accompaniment&#8212;the&#10;sound came from the left, from the side where the heart is. Now&#10;something rustled among the bushes, and a little boy stood before&#10;the king&#39;s son, in wooden shoes and such a short jacket that the&#10;sleeves did not reach to his wrists. They knew each other: the boy&#10;was the one who had not been able to go with them because he had to&#10;take the coat and boots back to his landlord&#39;s son. That he had&#10;done, and had started again in his wooden shoes and old clothes,&#10;for the sound of the bell was too enticing&#8212;he felt he must go&#10;on.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;We might go together,&#34; said the king&#39;s son. But the poor&#10;boy with the wooden shoes was quite ashamed; he pulled at the short&#10;sleeves of his jacket, and said that he was afraid he could not&#10;walk so fast; besides, he was of opinion that the bell ought to be&#10;sought at the right, for there was all that was grand and&#10;magnificent.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Then we shall not meet,&#34; said the king&#39;s son, nodding to&#10;the poor boy, who went into the deepest part of the wood, where the&#10;thorns tore his shabby clothes and scratched his hands, face, and&#10;feet until they bled. The king&#39;s son also received several good&#10;scratches, but the sun was shining on his way, and it is he whom we&#10;will now follow, for he was a quick fellow. &#34;I will and must find&#10;the bell,&#34; he said, &#34;if I have to go to the end of the&#10;world.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Ugly monkeys sat high in the branches and clenched their&#10;teeth. &#34;Shall we beat him?&#34; they said. &#34;Shall we thrash him? He is&#10;a king&#39;s son!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But he walked on undaunted, deeper and deeper into the&#10;wood, where the most wonderful flowers were growing; there were&#10;standing white star lilies with blood-red stamens, sky-blue tulips&#10;shining when the wind moved them; apple-trees covered with apples&#10;like large glittering soap bubbles: only think how resplendent&#10;these trees were in the sunshine! All around were beautiful green&#10;meadows, where hart and hind played in the grass. There grew&#10;magnificent oaks and beech-trees; and if the bark was split of any&#10;of them, long blades of grass grew out of the clefts; there were&#10;also large smooth lakes in the wood, on which the swans were&#10;swimming about and flapping their wings. The king&#39;s son often stood&#10;still and listened; sometimes he thought that the sound of the bell&#10;rose up to him out of one of these deep lakes, but soon he found&#10;that this was a mistake, and that the bell was ringing still&#10;farther in the wood. Then the sun set, the clouds were as red as&#10;fire; it became quiet in the wood; he sank down on his knees, sang&#10;an evening hymn and said: &#34;I shall never find what I am looking&#10;for! Now the sun is setting, and the night, the dark night, is&#10;approaching. Yet I may perhaps see the round sun once more before&#10;he disappears beneath the horizon. I will climb up these rocks,&#10;they are as high as the highest trees!&#34; And then, taking hold of&#10;the creepers and roots, he climbed up on the wet stones, where&#10;water-snakes were wriggling and the toads, as it were, barked at&#10;him: he reached the top before the sun, seen from such a height,&#10;had quite set. &#34;Oh, what a splendour!&#34; The sea, the great majestic&#10;sea, which was rolling its long waves against the shore, stretched&#10;out before him, and the sun was standing like a large bright altar&#10;and there where sea and heaven met&#8212;all melted together in the most&#10;glowing colours; the wood was singing, and his heart too. The whole&#10;of nature was one large holy church, in which the trees and&#10;hovering clouds formed the pillars, the flowers and grass the woven&#10;velvet carpet, and heaven itself was the great cupola; up there the&#10;flame colour vanished as soon as the sun disappeared, but millions&#10;of stars were lighted; diamond lamps were shining, and the king&#39;s&#10;son stretched his arms out towards heaven, towards the sea, and&#10;towards the wood. Then suddenly the poor boy with the short-sleeved&#10;jacket and the wooden shoes appeared; he had arrived just as&#10;quickly on the road he had chosen. And they ran towards each other&#10;and took one another&#39;s hand, in the great cathedral of nature and&#10;poesy, and above them sounded the invisible holy bell; happy&#10;spirits surrounded them, singing hallelujahs and rejoicing.&#10;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Bell-Deep'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;DING-DONG! ding-dong!&#34; It sounds up from the &#34;bell-deep&#34;&#10;in the Odense-Au. Every child in the old town of Odense, on the&#10;island of Funen, knows the Au, which washes the gardens round about&#10;the town, and flows on under the wooden bridges from the dam to the&#10;water-mill. In the Au grow the yellow water-lilies and brown&#10;feathery reeds; the dark velvety flag grows there, high and thick;&#10;old and decayed willows, slanting and tottering, hang far out over&#10;the stream beside the monk&#39;s meadow and by the bleaching ground;&#10;but opposite there are gardens upon gardens, each different from&#10;the rest, some with pretty flowers and bowers like little dolls&#39;&#10;pleasure grounds, often displaying cabbage and other kitchen&#10;plants; and here and there the gardens cannot be seen at all, for&#10;the great elder trees that spread themselves out by the bank, and&#10;hang far out over the streaming waters, which are deeper here and&#10;there than an oar can fathom. Opposite the old nunnery is the&#10;deepest place, which is called the &#34;bell-deep,&#34; and there dwells&#10;the old water spirit, the &#34;Au-mann.&#34; This spirit sleeps through the&#10;day while the sun shines down upon the water; but in starry and&#10;moonlit nights he shows himself. He is very old. Grandmother says&#10;that she has heard her own grandmother tell of him; he is said to&#10;lead a solitary life, and to have nobody with whom he can converse&#10;save the great old church Bell. Once the Bell hung in the church&#10;tower; but now there is no trace left of the tower or of the&#10;church, which was called St. Alban&#39;s.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ding-dong! ding-dong!&#34; sounded the Bell, when the tower&#10;still stood there; and one evening, while the sun was setting, and&#10;the Bell was swinging away bravely, it broke loose and came flying&#10;down through the air, the brilliant metal shining in the ruddy&#10;beam.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ding-dong! ding-dong! Now I&#39;ll retire to rest!&#34; sang the&#10;Bell, and flew down into the Odense-Au, where it is deepest; and&#10;that is why the place is called the &#34;bell-deep.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But the Bell got neither rest nor sleep. Down in the&#10;Au-mann&#39;s haunt it sounds and rings, so that the tones sometimes&#10;pierce upward through the waters; and many people maintain that its&#10;strains forebode the death of some one; but that is not true, for&#10;the Bell is only talking with the Au-mann, who is now no longer&#10;alone.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And what is the Bell telling? It is old, very old, as we&#10;have already observed; it was there long before grandmother&#39;s&#10;grandmother was born; and yet it is but a child in comparison with&#10;the Au-mann, who is quite an old quiet personage, an oddity, with&#10;his hose of eel-skin, and his scaly Jacket with the yellow lilies&#10;for buttons, and a wreath of reed in his hair and seaweed in his&#10;beard; but he looks very pretty for all that.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;What the Bell tells? To repeat it all would require years&#10;and days; for year by year it is telling the old stories, sometimes&#10;short ones, sometimes long ones, according to its whim; it tells of&#10;old times, of the dark hard times, thus:&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;In the church of St. Alban, the monk had mounted up into&#10;the tower. He was young and handsome, but thoughtful exceedingly.&#10;He looked through the loophole out upon the Odense-Au, when the bed&#10;of the water was yet broad, and the monks&#39; meadow was still a lake.&#10;He looked out over it, and over the rampart, and over the nuns&#39;&#10;hill opposite, where the convent lay, and the light gleamed forth&#10;from the nun&#39;s cell. He had known the nun right well, and he&#10;thought of her, and his heart beat quicker as he thought.&#10;Ding-dong! ding-dong!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Yes, this was the story the Bell told.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Into the tower came also the dapper man-servant of the&#10;bishop; and when I, the Bell, who am made of metal, rang hard and&#10;loud, and swung to and fro, I might have beaten out his brains. He&#10;sat down close under me, and played with two little sticks as if&#10;they had been a stringed instrument; and he sang to it. &#39;Now I may&#10;sing it out aloud, though at other times I may not whisper it. I&#10;may sing of everything that is kept concealed behind lock and bars.&#10;Yonder it is cold and wet. The rats are eating her up alive! Nobody&#10;knows of it! Nobody hears of it! Not even now, for the bell is&#10;ringing and singing its loud Ding-dong, ding-dong!&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;There was a King in those days. They called him Canute.&#10;He bowed himself before bishop and monk; but when he offended the&#10;free peasants with heavy taxes and hard words, they seized their&#10;weapons and put him to flight like a wild beast. He sought shelter&#10;in the church, and shut gate and door behind him. The violent band&#10;surrounded the church; I heard tell of it. The crows, ravens and&#10;magpies started up in terror at the yelling and shouting that&#10;sounded around. They flew into the tower and out again, they looked&#10;down upon the throng below, and they also looked into the windows&#10;of the church, and screamed out aloud what they saw there. King&#10;Canute knelt before the altar in prayer; his brothers Eric and&#10;Benedict stood by him as a guard with drawn swords; but the King&#39;s&#10;servant, the treacherous Blake, betrayed his master. The throng in&#10;front of the church knew where they could hit the King, and one of&#10;them flung a stone through a pane of glass, and the King lay there&#10;dead! The cries and screams of the savage horde and of the birds&#10;sounded through the air, and I joined in it also; for I sang&#10;&#39;Ding-dong! ding-dong!&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The church bell hangs high, and looks far around, and&#10;sees the birds around it, and understands their language. The wind&#10;roars in upon it through windows and loopholes; and the wind knows&#10;everything, for he gets it from the air, which encircles all&#10;things, and the church bell understands his tongue, and rings it&#10;out into the world, &#39;Ding-dong! ding-dong!&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But it was too much for me to hear and to know; I was not&#10;able any longer to ring it out. I became so tired, so heavy, that&#10;the beam broke, and I flew out into the gleaming Au, where the&#10;water is deepest, and where the Au-mann lives, solitary and alone;&#10;and year by year I tell him what I have heard and what I know.&#10;Ding-dong! ding-dong&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Thus it sounds complainingly out of the bell-deep in the&#10;Odense-Au. That is what grandmother told us.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But the schoolmaster says that there was not any bell that&#10;rung down there, for that it could not do so; and that no Au-mann&#10;dwelt yonder, for there was no Au-mann at all! And when all the&#10;other church bells are sounding sweetly, he says that it is not&#10;really the bells that are sounding, but that it is the air itself&#10;which sends forth the notes; and grandmother said to us that the&#10;Bell itself said it was the air who told it to him, consequently&#10;they are agreed on that point, and this much is sure.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Be cautious, cautious, and take good heed to thyself,&#34;&#10;they both say.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The air knows everything. It is around us, it is in us, it&#10;talks of our thoughts and of our deeds, and it speaks longer of&#10;them than does the Bell down in the depths of the Odense-Au where&#10;the Au-mann dwells.

Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Bishop of Borglum and His Warriors'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;OUR scene is laid in Northern Jutland, in the so-called&#10;&#34;wild moor.&#34; We hear what is called the &#34;Wester-wow-wow&#34;&#8212;the&#10;peculiar roar of the North Sea as it breaks against the western&#10;coast of Jutland. It rolls and thunders with a sound that&#10;penetrates for miles into the land; and we are quite near the&#10;roaring. Before us rises a great mound of sand&#8212;a mountain we have&#10;long seen, and towards which we are wending our way, driving slowly&#10;along through the deep sand. On this mountain of sand is a lofty&#10;old building&#8212;the convent of Borglum. In one of its wings (the&#10;larger one) there is still a church. And at this convent we now&#10;arrive in the late evening hour; but the weather is clear in the&#10;bright June night around us, and the eye can range far, far over&#10;field and moor to the Bay of Aalborg, over heath and meadow, and&#10;far across the deep blue sea.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Now we are there, and roll past between barns and other&#10;farm buildings; and at the left of the gate we turn aside to the&#10;Old Castle Farm, where the lime trees stand in lines along the&#10;walls, and, sheltered from the wind and weather, grow so&#10;luxuriantly that their twigs and leaves almost conceal the&#10;windows.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;We mount the winding staircase of stone, and march through&#10;the long passages under the heavy roof-beams. The wind moans very&#10;strangely here, both within and without. It is hardly known how,&#10;but the people say&#8212;yes, people say a great many things when they&#10;are frightened or want to frighten others&#8212;they say that the old&#10;dead choir-men glide silently past us into the church, where mass&#10;is sung. They can be heard in the rushing of the storm, and their&#10;singing brings up strange thoughts in the hearers&#8212;thoughts of the&#10;old times into which we are carried back.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;On the coast a ship is stranded; and the bishop&#39;s warriors&#10;are there, and spare not those whom the sea has spared. The sea&#10;washes away the blood that has flowed from the cloven skulls. The&#10;stranded goods belong to the bishop, and there is a store of goods&#10;here. The sea casts up tubs and barrels filled with costly wine for&#10;the convent cellar, and in the convent is already good store of&#10;beer and mead. There is plenty in the kitchen&#8212;dead game and&#10;poultry, hams and sausages; and fat fish swim in the ponds&#10;without.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Bishop of Borglum is a mighty lord. He has great&#10;possessions, but still he longs for more&#8212;everything must bow before&#10;the mighty Olaf Glob. His rich cousin at Thyland is dead, and his&#10;widow is to have the rich inheritance. But how comes it that one&#10;relation is always harder towards another than even strangers would&#10;be? The widow&#39;s husband had possessed all Thyland, with the&#10;exception of the church property. Her son was not at home. In his&#10;boyhood he had already started on a journey, for his desire was to&#10;see foreign lands and strange people. For years there had been no&#10;news of him. Perhaps he had been long laid in the grave, and would&#10;never come back to his home, to rule where his mother then&#10;ruled.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What has a woman to do with rule?&#34; said the&#10;bishop.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;He summoned the widow before a law court; but what did he&#10;gain thereby? The widow had never been disobedient to the law, and&#10;was strong in her just rights.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Bishop Olaf of Borglum, what dost thou purpose? What&#10;writest thou on yonder smooth parchment, sealing it with thy seal,&#10;and intrusting it to the horsemen and servants, who ride away, far&#10;away, to the city of the Pope?&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It is the time of falling leaves and of stranded ships,&#10;and soon icy winter will come.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Twice had icy winter returned before the bishop welcomed&#10;the horsemen and servants back to their home. They came from Rome&#10;with a papal decree&#8212;a ban, or bull, against the widow who had dared&#10;to offend the pious bishop. &#34;Cursed be she and all that belongs to&#10;her. Let her be expelled from the congregation and the Church. Let&#10;no man stretch forth a helping hand to her, and let friends and&#10;relations avoid her as a plague and a pestilence!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What will not bend must break,&#34; said the Bishop of&#10;Borglum&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And all forsake the widow; but she holds fast to her God.&#10;He is her helper and defender.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;One servant only&#8212;an old maid&#8212;remained faithful to her; and&#10;with the old servant, the widow herself followed the plough; and&#10;the crop grew, although the land had been cursed by the Pope and by&#10;the bishop.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Thou child of perdition, I will yet carry out my&#10;purpose!&#34; cried the Bishop of Borglum. &#34;Now will I lay the hand of&#10;the Pope upon thee, to summon thee before the tribunal that shall&#10;condemn thee!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then did the widow yoke the last two oxen that remained to&#10;her to a wagon, and mounted up on the wagon, with her old servant,&#10;and travelled away across the heath out of the Danish land. As a&#10;stranger she came into a foreign country, where a strange tongue&#10;was spoken and where new customs prevailed. Farther and farther she&#10;journeyed, to where green hills rise into mountains, and the vine&#10;clothes their sides. Strange merchants drive by her, and they look&#10;anxiously after their wagons laden with merchandise. They fear an&#10;attack from the armed followers of the robber-knights. The two poor&#10;women, in their humble vehicle drawn by two black oxen, travel&#10;fearlessly through the dangerous sunken road and through the&#10;darksome forest. And now they were in Franconia. And there met them&#10;a stalwart knight, with a train of twelve armed followers. He&#10;paused, gazed at the strange vehicle, and questioned the women as&#10;to the goal of their journey and the place whence they came. Then&#10;one of them mentioned Thyland in Denmark, and spoke of her sorrows,&#10;of her woes, which were soon to cease, for so Divine Providence had&#10;willed it. For the stranger knight is the widow&#39;s son! He seized&#10;her hand, he embraced her, and the mother wept. For years she had&#10;not been able to weep, but had only bitten her lips till the blood&#10;started.&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It is the time of falling leaves and of stranded ships,&#10;and soon will icy winter come.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The sea rolled wine-tubs to the shore for the bishop&#39;s&#10;cellar. In the kitchen the deer roasted on the spit before the&#10;fire. At Borglum it was warm and cheerful in the heated rooms,&#10;while cold winter raged without, when a piece of news was brought&#10;to the bishop. &#34;Jens Glob, of Thyland, has come back, and his&#10;mother with him.&#34; Jens Glob laid a complaint against the bishop,&#10;and summoned him before the temporal and the spiritual&#10;court.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That will avail him little,&#34; said the bishop. &#34;Best leave&#10;off thy efforts, knight Jens.&#34;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Again it is the time of falling leaves and stranded ships.&#10;Icy winter comes again, and the &#34;white bees&#34; are swarming, and&#10;sting the traveller&#39;s face till they melt.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Keen weather to-day!&#34; say the people, as they step&#10;in.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Jens Glob stands so deeply wrapped in thought, that he&#10;singes the skirt of his wide garment.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Thou Borglum bishop,&#34; he exclaims, &#34;I shall subdue thee&#10;after all! Under the shield of the Pope, the law cannot reach thee;&#10;but Jens Glob shall reach thee!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then he writes a letter to his brother-in-law, Olaf Hase,&#10;in Sallingland, and prays that knight to meet him on Christmas eve,&#10;at mass, in the church at Widberg. The bishop himself is to read&#10;the mass, and consequently will journey from Borglum to Thyland;&#10;and this is known to Jens Glob.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Moorland and meadow are covered with ice and snow. The&#10;marsh will bear horse and rider, the bishop with his priests and&#10;armed men. They ride the shortest way, through the waving reeds,&#10;where the wind moans sadly.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Blow thy brazen trumpet, thou trumpeter clad in fox-skin!&#10;it sounds merrily in the clear air. So they ride on over heath and&#10;moorland&#8212;over what is the garden of Fata Morgana in the hot summer,&#10;though now icy, like all the country&#8212;towards the church of&#10;Widberg.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The wind is blowing his trumpet too&#8212;blowing it harder and&#10;harder. He blows up a storm&#8212;a terrible storm&#8212;that increases more&#10;and more. Towards the church they ride, as fast as they may through&#10;the storm. The church stands firm, but the storm careers on over&#10;field and moorland, over land and sea.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Borglum&#39;s bishop reaches the church; but Olaf Hase will&#10;scarce do so, however hard he may ride. He journeys with his&#10;warriors on the farther side of the bay, in order that he may help&#10;Jens Glob, now that the bishop is to be summoned before the&#10;judgment seat of the Highest.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The church is the judgment hall; the altar is the council&#10;table. The lights burn clear in the heavy brass candelabra. The&#10;storm reads out the accusation and the sentence, roaming in the air&#10;over moor and heath, and over the rolling waters. No ferry-boat can&#10;sail over the bay in such weather as this.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Olaf Hase makes halt at Ottesworde. There he dismisses his&#10;warriors, presents them with their horses and harness, and gives&#10;them leave to ride home and greet his wife. He intends to risk his&#10;life alone in the roaring waters; but they are to bear witness for&#10;him that it is not his fault if Jens Glob stands without&#10;reinforcement in the church at Widberg. The faithful warriors will&#10;not leave him, but follow him out into the deep waters. Ten of them&#10;are carried away; but Olaf Hase and two of the youngest men reach&#10;the farther side. They have still four miles to ride.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It is past midnight. It is Christmas. The wind has abated.&#10;The church is lighted up; the gleaming radiance shines through the&#10;window-frames, and pours out over meadow and heath. The mass has&#10;long been finished, silence reigns in the church, and the wax is&#10;heard dropping from the candles to the stone pavement. And now Olaf&#10;Hase arrives.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the forecourt Jens Glob greets him kindly, and&#10;says,&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I have just made an agreement with the&#10;bishop.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Sayest thou so?&#34; replied Olaf Hase. &#34;Then neither thou&#10;nor the bishop shall quit this church alive.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the sword leaps from the scabbard, and Olaf Hase deals&#10;a blow that makes the panel of the church door, which Jens Glob&#10;hastily closes between them, fly in fragments.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Hold, brother! First hear what the agreement was that I&#10;made. I have slain the bishop and his warriors and priests. They&#10;will have no word more to say in the matter, nor will I speak again&#10;of all the wrong that my mother has endured.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The long wicks of the altar lights glimmer red; but there&#10;is a redder gleam upon the pavement, where the bishop lies with&#10;cloven skull, and his dead warriors around him, in the quiet of the&#10;holy Christmas night.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And four days afterwards the bells toll for a funeral in&#10;the convent of Borglum. The murdered bishop and the slain warriors&#10;and priests are displayed under a black canopy, surrounded by&#10;candelabra decked with crape. There lies the dead man, in the black&#10;cloak wrought with silver; the crozier in the powerless hand that&#10;was once so mighty. The incense rises in clouds, and the monks&#10;chant the funeral hymn. It sounds like a wail&#8212;it sounds like a&#10;sentence of wrath and condemnation, that must be heard far over the&#10;land, carried by the wind&#8212;sung by the wind&#8212;the wail that sometimes&#10;is silent, but never dies; for ever again it rises in song, singing&#10;even into our own time this legend of the Bishop of Borglum and his&#10;hard nephew. It is heard in the dark night by the frightened&#10;husbandman, driving by in the heavy sandy road past the convent of&#10;Borglum. It is heard by the sleepless listener in the&#10;thickly-walled rooms at Borglum. And not only to the ear of&#10;superstition is the sighing and the tread of hurrying feet audible&#10;in the long echoing passages leading to the convent door that has&#10;long been locked. The door still seems to open, and the lights seem&#10;to flame in the brazen candlesticks; the fragrance of incense&#10;arises; the church gleams in its ancient splendor; and the monks&#10;sing and say the mass over the slain bishop, who lies there in the&#10;black silver-embroidered mantle, with the crozier in his powerless&#10;hand; and on his pale proud forehead gleams the red wound like&#10;fire, and there burn the worldly mind and the wicked&#10;thoughts.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Sink down into his grave&#8212;into oblivion&#8212;ye terrible shapes&#10;of the times of old!&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Hark to the raging of the angry wind, sounding above the&#10;rolling sea! A storm approaches without, calling aloud for human&#10;lives. The sea has not put on a new mind with the new time. This&#10;night it is a horrible pit to devour up lives, and to-morrow,&#10;perhaps, it may be a glassy mirror&#8212;even as in the old time that we&#10;have buried. Sleep sweetly, if thou canst sleep!&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Now it is morning.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The new time flings sunshine into the room. The wind still&#10;keeps up mightily. A wreck is announced&#8212;as in the old&#10;time.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;During the night, down yonder by Lokken, the little&#10;fishing village with the red-tiled roofs&#8212;we can see it up here from&#10;the window&#8212;a ship has come ashore. It has struck, and is fast&#10;embedded in the sand; but the rocket apparatus has thrown a rope on&#10;board, and formed a bridge from the wreck to the mainland; and all&#10;on board are saved, and reach the land, and are wrapped in warm&#10;blankets; and to-day they are invited to the farm at the convent of&#10;Borglum. In comfortable rooms they encounter hospitality and&#10;friendly faces. They are addressed in the language of their&#10;country, and the piano sounds for them with melodies of their&#10;native land; and before these have died away, the chord has been&#10;struck, the wire of thought that reaches to the land of the&#10;sufferers announces that they are rescued. Then their anxieties are&#10;dispelled; and at even they join in the dance at the feast given in&#10;the great hall at Borglum. Waltzes and Styrian dances are given,&#10;and Danish popular songs, and melodies of foreign lands in these&#10;modern times.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Blessed be thou, new time! Speak thou of summer and of&#10;purer gales! Send thy sunbeams gleaming into our hearts and&#10;thoughts! On thy glowing canvas let them be painted&#8212;the dark&#10;legends of the rough hard times that are past! &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Bottle Neck'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;CLOSE to the corner of a street, among other abodes of&#10;poverty, stood an exceedingly tall, narrow house, which had been so&#10;knocked about by time that it seemed out of joint in every&#10;direction. This house was inhabited by poor people, but the deepest&#10;poverty was apparent in the garret lodging in the gable. In front&#10;of the little window, an old bent bird-cage hung in the sunshine,&#10;which had not even a proper water-glass, but instead of it the&#10;broken neck of a bottle, turned upside down, and a cork stuck in to&#10;make it hold the water with which it was filled. An old maid stood&#10;at the window; she had hung chickweed over the cage, and the little&#10;linnet which it contained hopped from perch to perch and sang and&#10;twittered merrily.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, it&#39;s all very well for you to sing,&#34; said the bottle&#10;neck: that is, he did not really speak the words as we do, for the&#10;neck of a bottle cannot speak; but he thought them to himself in&#10;his own mind, just as people sometimes talk quietly to&#10;themselves.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, you may sing very well, you have all your limbs&#10;uninjured; you should feel what it is like to lose your body, and&#10;only have a neck and a mouth left, with a cork stuck in it, as I&#10;have: you wouldn&#39;t sing then, I know. After all, it is just as well&#10;that there are some who can be happy. I have no reason to sing, nor&#10;could I sing now if I were ever so happy; but when I was a whole&#10;bottle, and they rubbed me with a cork, didn&#39;t I sing then? I used&#10;to be called a complete lark. I remember when I went out to a&#10;picnic with the furrier&#39;s family, on the day his daughter was&#10;betrothed,&#8212;it seems as if it only happened yesterday. I have gone&#10;through a great deal in my time, when I come to recollect: I have&#10;been in the fire and in the water, I have been deep in the earth,&#10;and have mounted higher in the air than most other people, and now&#10;I am swinging here, outside a bird-cage, in the air and the&#10;sunshine. Oh, indeed, it would be worth while to hear my history;&#10;but I do not speak it aloud, for a good reason&#8212;because I&#10;cannot.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the bottle neck related his history, which was really&#10;rather remarkable; he, in fact, related it to himself, or, at&#10;least, thought it in his own mind. The little bird sang his own&#10;song merrily; in the street below there was driving and running to&#10;and fro, every one thought of his own affairs, or perhaps of&#10;nothing at all; but the bottle neck thought deeply. He thought of&#10;the blazing furnace in the factory, where he had been blown into&#10;life; he remembered how hot it felt when he was placed in the&#10;heated oven, the home from which he sprang, and that he had a&#10;strong inclination to leap out again directly; but after a while it&#10;became cooler, and he found himself very comfortable. He had been&#10;placed in a row, with a whole regiment of his brothers and sisters&#10;all brought out of the same furnace; some of them had certainly&#10;been blown into champagne bottles, and others into beer bottles,&#10;which made a little difference between them. In the world it often&#10;happens that a beer bottle may contain the most precious wine, and&#10;a champagne bottle be filled with blacking, but even in decay it&#10;may always be seen whether a man has been well born. Nobility&#10;remains noble, as a champagne bottle remains the same, even with&#10;blacking in its interior. When the bottles were packed our bottle&#10;was packed amongst them; it little expected then to finish its&#10;career as a bottle neck, or to be used as a water-glass to a&#10;bird&#39;s-cage, which is, after all, a place of honor, for it is to be&#10;of some use in the world. The bottle did not behold the light of&#10;day again, until it was unpacked with the rest in the wine&#10;merchant&#39;s cellar, and, for the first time, rinsed with water,&#10;which caused some very curious sensations. There it lay empty, and&#10;without a cork, and it had a peculiar feeling, as if it wanted&#10;something it knew not what. At last it was filled with rich and&#10;costly wine, a cork was placed in it, and sealed down. Then it was&#10;labelled &#34;first quality,&#34; as if it had carried off the first prize&#10;at an examination; besides, the wine and the bottle were both good,&#10;and while we are young is the time for poetry. There were sounds of&#10;song within the bottle, of things it could not understand, of green&#10;sunny mountains, where the vines grow and where the merry&#10;vine-dressers laugh, sing, and are merry. &#34;Ah, how beautiful is&#10;life.&#34; All these tones of joy and song in the bottle were like the&#10;working of a young poet&#39;s brain, who often knows not the meaning of&#10;the tones which are sounding within him. One morning the bottle&#10;found a purchaser in the furrier&#39;s apprentice, who was told to&#10;bring one of the best bottles of wine. It was placed in the&#10;provision basket with ham and cheese and sausages. The sweetest&#10;fresh butter and the finest bread were put into the basket by the&#10;furrier&#39;s daughter herself, for she packed it. She was young and&#10;pretty; her brown eyes laughed, and a smile lingered round her&#10;mouth as sweet as that in her eyes. She had delicate hands,&#10;beautifully white, and her neck was whiter still. It could easily&#10;be seen that she was a very lovely girl, and as yet she was not&#10;engaged. The provision basket lay in the lap of the young girl as&#10;the family drove out to the forest, and the neck of the bottle&#10;peeped out from between the folds of the white napkin. There was&#10;the red wax on the cork, and the bottle looked straight at the&#10;young girl&#39;s face, and also at the face of the young sailor who sat&#10;near her. He was a young friend, the son of a portrait painter. He&#10;had lately passed his examination with honor, as mate, and the next&#10;morning he was to sail in his ship to a distant coast. There had&#10;been a great deal of talk on this subject while the basket was&#10;being packed, and during this conversation the eyes and the mouth&#10;of the furrier&#39;s daughter did not wear a very joyful expression.&#10;The young people wandered away into the green wood, and talked&#10;together. What did they talk about? The bottle could not say, for&#10;he was in the provision basket. It remained there a long time; but&#10;when at last it was brought forth it appeared as if something&#10;pleasant had happened, for every one was laughing; the furrier&#39;s&#10;daughter laughed too, but she said very little, and her cheeks were&#10;like two roses. Then her father took the bottle and the cork-screw&#10;into his hands. What a strange sensation it was to have the cork&#10;drawn for the first time! The bottle could never after that forget&#10;the performance of that moment; indeed there was quite a convulsion&#10;within him as the cork flew out, and a gurgling sound as the wine&#10;was poured forth into the glasses.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Long life to the betrothed,&#34; cried the papa, and every&#10;glass was emptied to the dregs, while the young sailor kissed his&#10;beautiful bride.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Happiness and blessing to you both,&#34; said the old&#10;people-father and mother, and the young man filled the glasses&#10;again.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Safe return, and a wedding this day next year,&#34; he cried;&#10;and when the glasses were empty he took the bottle, raised it on&#10;high, and said, &#34;Thou hast been present here on the happiest day of&#10;my life; thou shalt never be used by others!&#34; So saying, he hurled&#10;it high in the air.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The furrier&#39;s daughter thought she should never see it&#10;again, but she was mistaken. It fell among the rushes on the&#10;borders of a little woodland lake. The bottle neck remembered well&#10;how long it lay there unseen. &#34;I gave them wine, and they gave me&#10;muddy water,&#34; he had said to himself, &#34;but I suppose it was all&#10;well meant.&#34; He could no longer see the betrothed couple, nor the&#10;cheerful old people; but for a long time he could hear them&#10;rejoicing and singing. At length there came by two peasant boys,&#10;who peeped in among the reeds and spied out the bottle. Then they&#10;took it up and carried it home with them, so that once more it was&#10;provided for. At home in their wooden cottage these boys had an&#10;elder brother, a sailor, who was about to start on a long voyage.&#10;He had been there the day before to say farewell, and his mother&#10;was now very busy packing up various things for him to take with&#10;him on his voyage. In the evening his father was going to carry the&#10;parcel to the town to see his son once more, and take him a&#10;farewell greeting from his mother. A small bottle had already been&#10;filled with herb tea, mixed with brandy, and wrapped in a parcel;&#10;but when the boys came in they brought with them a larger and&#10;stronger bottle, which they had found. This bottle would hold so&#10;much more than the little one, and they all said the brandy would&#10;be so good for complaints of the stomach, especially as it was&#10;mixed with medical herbs. The liquid which they now poured into the&#10;bottle was not like the red wine with which it had once been&#10;filled; these were bitter drops, but they are of great use&#10;sometimes-for the stomach. The new large bottle was to go, not the&#10;little one: so the bottle once more started on its travels. It was&#10;taken on board (for Peter Jensen was one of the crew) the very same&#10;ship in which the young mate was to sail. But the mate did not see&#10;the bottle: indeed, if he had he would not have known it, or&#10;supposed it was the one out of which they had drunk to the felicity&#10;of the betrothed and to the prospect of a marriage on his own happy&#10;return. Certainly the bottle no longer poured forth wine, but it&#10;contained something quite as good; and so it happened that whenever&#10;Peter Jensen brought it out, his messmates gave it the name of &#34;the&#10;apothecary,&#34; for it contained the best medicine to cure the&#10;stomach, and he gave it out quite willingly as long as a drop&#10;remained. Those were happy days, and the bottle would sing when&#10;rubbed with a cork, and it was called a great lark,&#34; &#34;Peter&#10;Jensen&#39;s lark.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Long days and months rolled by, during which the bottle&#10;stood empty in a corner, when a storm arose&#8212;whether on the passage&#10;out or home it could not tell, for it had never been ashore. It was&#10;a terrible storm, great waves arose, darkly heaving and tossing the&#10;vessel to and fro. The main mast was split asunder, the ship sprang&#10;a leak, and the pumps became useless, while all around was black as&#10;night. At the last moment, when the ship was sinking, the young&#10;mate wrote on a piece of paper, &#34;We are going down: God&#39;s will be&#10;done.&#34; Then he wrote the name of his betrothed, his own name, and&#10;that of the ship. Then he put the leaf in an empty bottle that&#10;happened to be at hand, corked it down tightly, and threw it into&#10;the foaming sea. He knew not that it was the very same bottle from&#10;which the goblet of joy and hope had once been filled for him, and&#10;now it was tossing on the waves with his last greeting, and a&#10;message from the dead. The ship sank, and the crew sank with her;&#10;but the bottle flew on like a bird, for it bore within it a loving&#10;letter from a loving heart. And as the sun rose and set, the bottle&#10;felt as at the time of its first existence, when in the heated&#10;glowing stove it had a longing to fly away. It outlived the storms&#10;and the calm, it struck against no rocks, was not devoured by&#10;sharks, but drifted on for more than a year, sometimes towards the&#10;north, sometimes towards the south, just as the current carried it.&#10;It was in all other ways its own master, but even of that one may&#10;get tired. The written leaf, the last farewell of the bridegroom to&#10;his bride, would only bring sorrow when once it reached her hands;&#10;but where were those hands, so soft and delicate, which had once&#10;spread the table-cloth on the fresh grass in the green wood, on the&#10;day of her betrothal? Ah, yes! where was the furrier&#39;s daughter?&#10;and where was the land which might lie nearest to her&#10;home?&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The bottle knew not, it travelled onward and onward, and&#10;at last all this wandering about became wearisome; at all events it&#10;was not its usual occupation. But it had to travel, till at length&#10;it reached land&#8212;a foreign country. Not a word spoken in this&#10;country could the bottle understand; it was a language it had never&#10;before heard, and it is a great loss not to be able to understand a&#10;language. The bottle was fished out of the water, and examined on&#10;all sides. The little letter contained within it was discovered,&#10;taken out, and turned and twisted in every direction; but the&#10;people could not understand what was written upon it. They could be&#10;quite sure that the bottle had been thrown overboard from a vessel,&#10;and that something about it was written on this paper: but what was&#10;written? that was the question,&#8212;so the paper was put back into the&#10;bottle, and then both were put away in a large cupboard of one of&#10;the great houses of the town. Whenever any strangers arrived, the&#10;paper was taken out and turned over and over, so that the address,&#10;which was only written in pencil, became almost illegible, and at&#10;last no one could distinguish any letters on it at all. For a whole&#10;year the bottle remained standing in the cupboard, and then it was&#10;taken up to the loft, where it soon became covered with dust and&#10;cobwebs. Ah! how often then it thought of those better days&#8212;of the&#10;times when in the fresh, green wood, it had poured forth rich wine;&#10;or, while rocked by the swelling waves, it had carried in its bosom&#10;a secret, a letter, a last parting sigh. For full twenty years it&#10;stood in the loft, and it might have stayed there longer but that&#10;the house was going to be rebuilt. The bottle was discovered when&#10;the roof was taken off; they talked about it, but the bottle did&#10;not understand what they said&#8212;a language is not to be learnt by&#10;living in a loft, even for twenty years. &#34;If I had been down stairs&#10;in the room,&#34; thought the bottle, &#34;I might have learnt it.&#34; It was&#10;now washed and rinsed, which process was really quite necessary,&#10;and afterwards it looked clean and transparent, and felt young&#10;again in its old age; but the paper which it had carried so&#10;faithfully was destroyed in the washing. They filled the bottle&#10;with seeds, though it scarcely knew what had been placed in it.&#10;Then they corked it down tightly, and carefully wrapped it up.&#10;There not even the light of a torch or lantern could reach it, much&#10;less the brightness of the sun or moon. &#34;And yet,&#34; thought the&#10;bottle, &#34;men go on a journey that they may see as much as possible,&#10;and I can see nothing.&#34; However, it did something quite as&#10;important; it travelled to the place of its destination, and was&#10;unpacked.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What trouble they have taken with that bottle over&#10;yonder!&#34; said one, and very likely it is broken after all.&#34; But the&#10;bottle was not broken, and, better still, it understood every word&#10;that was said: this language it had heard at the furnaces and at&#10;the wine merchant&#39;s; in the forest and on the ship,&#8212;it was the only&#10;good old language it could understand. It had returned home, and&#10;the language was as a welcome greeting. For very joy, it felt ready&#10;to jump out of people&#39;s hands, and scarcely noticed that its cork&#10;had been drawn, and its contents emptied out, till it found itself&#10;carried to a cellar, to be left there and forgotten. &#34;There&#39;s no&#10;place like home, even if it&#39;s a cellar.&#34; It never occurred to him&#10;to think that he might lie there for years, he felt so comfortable.&#10;For many long years he remained in the cellar, till at last some&#10;people came to carry away the bottles, and ours amongst the&#10;number.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Out in the garden there was a great festival. Brilliant&#10;lamps hung in festoons from tree to tree; and paper lanterns,&#10;through which the light shone till they looked like transparent&#10;tulips. It was a beautiful evening, and the weather mild and clear.&#10;The stars twinkled; and the new moon, in the form of a crescent,&#10;was surrounded by the shadowy disc of the whole moon, and looked&#10;like a gray globe with a golden rim: it was a beautiful sight for&#10;those who had good eyes. The illumination extended even to the most&#10;retired of the garden walks, at least not so retired that any one&#10;need lose himself there. In the borders were placed bottles, each&#10;containing a light, and among them the bottle with which we are&#10;acquainted, and whose fate it was, one day, to be only a bottle&#10;neck, and to serve as a water-glass to a bird&#39;s-cage. Everything&#10;here appeared lovely to our bottle, for it was again in the green&#10;wood, amid joy and feasting; again it heard music and song, and the&#10;noise and murmur of a crowd, especially in that part of the garden&#10;where the lamps blazed, and the paper lanterns displayed their&#10;brilliant colors. It stood in a distant walk certainly, but a place&#10;pleasant for contemplation; and it carried a light; and was at once&#10;useful and ornamental. In such an hour it is easy to forget that&#10;one has spent twenty years in a loft, and a good thing it is to be&#10;able to do so. Close before the bottle passed a single pair, like&#10;the bridal pair&#8212;the mate and the furrier&#39;s daughter&#8212;who had so long&#10;ago wandered in the wood. It seemed to the bottle as if he were&#10;living that time over again. Not only the guests but other people&#10;were walking in the garden, who were allowed to witness the&#10;splendor and the festivities. Among the latter came an old maid,&#10;who seemed to be quite alone in the world. She was thinking, like&#10;the bottle, of the green wood, and of a young betrothed pair, who&#10;were closely connected with herself; she was thinking of that hour,&#10;the happiest of her life, in which she had taken part, when she had&#10;herself been one of that betrothed pair; such hours are never to be&#10;forgotten, let a maiden be as old as she may. But she did not&#10;recognize the bottle, neither did the bottle notice the old maid.&#10;And so we often pass each other in the world when we meet, as did&#10;these two, even while together in the same town.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The bottle was taken from the garden, and again sent to a&#10;wine merchant, where it was once more filled with wine, and sold to&#10;an aeronaut, who was to make an ascent in his balloon on the&#10;following Sunday. A great crowd assembled to witness the sight;&#10;military music had been engaged, and many other preparations made.&#10;The bottle saw it all from the basket in which he lay close to a&#10;live rabbit. The rabbit was quite excited because he knew that he&#10;was to be taken up, and let down again in a parachute. The bottle,&#10;however, knew nothing of the &#34;up,&#34; or the &#34;down;&#34; he saw only that&#10;the balloon was swelling larger and larger till it could swell no&#10;more, and began to rise and be restless. Then the ropes which held&#10;it were cut through, and the aerial ship rose in the air with the&#10;aeronaut and the basket containing the bottle and the rabbit, while&#10;the music sounded and all the people shouted &#34;Hurrah.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;This is a wonderful journey up into the air,&#34; thought the&#10;bottle; &#34;it is a new way of sailing, and here, at least, there is&#10;no fear of striking against anything.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Thousands of people gazed at the balloon, and the old maid&#10;who was in the garden saw it also; for she stood at the open window&#10;of the garret, by which hung the cage containing the linnet, who&#10;then had no water-glass, but was obliged to be contented with an&#10;old cup. In the window-sill stood a myrtle in a pot, and this had&#10;been pushed a little on one side, that it might not fall out; for&#10;the old maid was leaning out of the window, that she might see. And&#10;she did see distinctly the aeronaut in the balloon, and how he let&#10;down the rabbit in the parachute, and then drank to the health of&#10;all the spectators in the wine from the bottle. After doing this,&#10;he hurled it high into the air. How little she thought that this&#10;was the very same bottle which her friend had thrown aloft in her&#10;honor, on that happy day of rejoicing, in the green wood, in her&#10;youthful days. The bottle had no time to think, when raised so&#10;suddenly; and before it was aware, it reached the highest point it&#10;had ever attained in its life. Steeples and roofs lay far, far&#10;beneath it, and the people looked as tiny as possible. Then it&#10;began to descend much more rapidly than the rabbit had done, made&#10;somersaults in the air, and felt itself quite young and unfettered,&#10;although it was half full of wine. But this did not last long. What&#10;a journey it was! All the people could see the bottle; for the sun&#10;shone upon it. The balloon was already far away, and very soon the&#10;bottle was far away also; for it fell upon a roof, and broke in&#10;pieces. But the pieces had got such an impetus in them, that they&#10;could not stop themselves. They went jumping and rolling about,&#10;till at last they fell into the court-yard, and were broken into&#10;still smaller pieces; only the neck of the bottle managed to keep&#10;whole, and it was broken off as clean as if it had been cut with a&#10;diamond.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That would make a capital bird&#39;s glass,&#34; said one of the&#10;cellar-men; but none of them had either a bird or a cage, and it&#10;was not to be expected they would provide one just because they had&#10;found a bottle neck that could be used as a glass. But the old maid&#10;who lived in the garret had a bird, and it really might be useful&#10;to her; so the bottle neck was provided with a cork, and taken up&#10;to her; and, as it often happens in life, the part that had been&#10;uppermost was now turned downwards, and it was filled with fresh&#10;water. Then they hung it in the cage of the little bird, who sang&#10;and twittered more merrily than ever.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ah, you have good reason to sing,&#34; said the bottle neck,&#10;which was looked upon as something very remarkable, because it had&#10;been in a balloon; nothing further was known of its history. As it&#10;hung there in the bird&#39;s-cage, it could hear the noise and murmur&#10;of the people in the street below, as well as the conversation of&#10;the old maid in the room within. An old friend had just come to&#10;visit her, and they talked, not about the bottle neck, but of the&#10;myrtle in the window.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No, you must not spend a dollar for your daughter&#39;s&#10;bridal bouquet,&#34; said the old maid; &#34;you shall have a beautiful&#10;little bunch for a nosegay, full of blossoms. Do you see how&#10;splendidly the tree has grown? It has been raised from only a&#10;little sprig of myrtle that you gave me on the day after my&#10;betrothal, and from which I was to make my own bridal bouquet when&#10;a year had passed: but that day never came; the eyes were closed&#10;which were to have been my light and joy through life. In the&#10;depths of the sea my beloved sleeps sweetly; the myrtle has become&#10;an old tree, and I am a still older woman. Before the sprig you&#10;gave me faded, I took a spray, and planted it in the earth; and&#10;now, as you see, it has become a large tree, and a bunch of the&#10;blossoms shall at last appear at a wedding festival, in the bouquet&#10;of your daughter.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;There were tears in the eyes of the old maid, as she spoke&#10;of the beloved of her youth, and of their betrothal in the wood.&#10;Many thoughts came into her mind; but the thought never came, that&#10;quite close to her, in that very window, was a remembrance of those&#10;olden times,&#8212;the neck of the bottle which had, as it were shouted&#10;for joy when the cork flew out with a bang on the betrothal day.&#10;But the bottle neck did not recognize the old maid; he had not been&#10;listening to what she had related, perhaps because he was thinking&#10;so much about her. &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Buckwheat'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;VERY often, after a violent thunder-storm, a field of&#10;buckwheat appears blackened and singed, as if a flame of fire had&#10;passed over it. The country people say that this appearance is&#10;caused by lightning; but I will tell you what the sparrow says, and&#10;the sparrow heard it from an old willow-tree which grew near a&#10;field of buckwheat, and is there still. It is a large venerable&#10;tree, though a little crippled by age. The trunk has been split,&#10;and out of the crevice grass and brambles grow. The tree bends&#10;for-ward slightly, and the branches hang quite down to the ground&#10;just like green hair. Corn grows in the surrounding fields, not&#10;only rye and barley, but oats,-pretty oats that, when ripe, look&#10;like a number of little golden canary-birds sitting on a bough. The&#10;corn has a smiling look and the heaviest and richest ears bend&#10;their heads low as if in pious humility. Once there was also a&#10;field of buckwheat, and this field was exactly opposite to old&#10;willow-tree. The buckwheat did not bend like the other grain, but&#10;erected its head proudly and stiffly on the stem. &#34;I am as valuable&#10;as any other corn,&#34; said he, &#34;and I am much handsomer; my flowers&#10;are as beautiful as the bloom of the apple blossom, and it is a&#10;pleasure to look at us. Do you know of anything prettier than we&#10;are, you old willow-tree?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the willow-tree nodded his head, as if he would say,&#10;&#34;Indeed I do.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But the buckwheat spread itself out with pride, and said,&#10;&#34;Stupid tree; he is so old that grass grows out of his&#10;body.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;There arose a very terrible storm. All the field-flowers&#10;folded their leaves together, or bowed their little heads, while&#10;the storm passed over them, but the buckwheat stood erect in its&#10;pride. &#34;Bend your head as we do,&#34; said the flowers.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I have no occasion to do so,&#34; replied the&#10;buckwheat.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Bend your head as we do,&#34; cried the ears of corn; &#34;the&#10;angel of the storm is coming; his wings spread from the sky above&#10;to the earth beneath. He will strike you down before you can cry&#10;for mercy.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But I will not bend my head,&#34; said the&#10;buckwheat.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Close your flowers and bend your leaves,&#34; said the old&#10;willow-tree. &#34;Do not look at the lightning when the cloud bursts;&#10;even men cannot do that. In a flash of lightning heaven opens, and&#10;we can look in; but the sight will strike even human beings blind.&#10;What then must happen to us, who only grow out of the earth, and&#10;are so inferior to them, if we venture to do so?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Inferior, indeed!&#34; said the buckwheat. &#34;Now I intend to&#10;have a peep into heaven.&#34; Proudly and boldly he looked up, while&#10;the lightning flashed across the sky as if the whole world were in&#10;flames.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;When the dreadful storm had passed, the flowers and the&#10;corn raised their drooping heads in the pure still air, refreshed&#10;by the rain, but the buckwheat lay like a weed in the field, burnt&#10;to blackness by the lightning. The branches of the old willow-tree&#10;rustled in the wind, and large water-drops fell from his green&#10;leaves as if the old willow were weeping. Then the sparrows asked&#10;why he was weeping, when all around him seemed so cheerful. &#34;See,&#34;&#10;they said, how the sun shines, and the clouds float in the blue&#10;sky. Do you not smell the sweet perfume from flower and bush?&#10;Wherefore do you weep, old willow-tree?&#34; Then the willow told them&#10;of the haughty pride of the buckwheat, and of the punishment which&#10;followed in consequence.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;This is the story told me by the sparrows one evening when&#10;I begged them to relate some tale to me.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Butterfly'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;THERE was once a butterfly who wished for a bride, and, as&#10;may be supposed, he wanted to choose a very pretty one from among&#10;the flowers. He glanced, with a very critical eye, at all the&#10;flower-beds, and found that the flowers were seated quietly and&#10;demurely on their stalks, just as maidens should sit before they&#10;are engaged; but there was a great number of them, and it appeared&#10;as if his search would become very wearisome. The butterfly did not&#10;like to take too much trouble, so he flew off on a visit to the&#10;daisies. The French call this flower &#34;Marguerite,&#34; and they say&#10;that the little daisy can prophesy. Lovers pluck off the leaves,&#10;and as they pluck each leaf, they ask a question about their&#10;lovers; thus: &#34;Does he or she love me?&#8212;Ardently? Distractedly? Very&#10;much? A little? Not at all?&#34; and so on. Every one speaks these&#10;words in his own language. The butterfly came also to Marguerite to&#10;inquire, but he did not pluck off her leaves; he pressed a kiss on&#10;each of them, for he thought there was always more to be done by&#10;kindness.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Darling Marguerite daisy,&#34; he said to her, &#34;you are the&#10;wisest woman of all the flowers. Pray tell me which of the flowers&#10;I shall choose for my wife. Which will be my bride? When I know, I&#10;will fly directly to her, and propose.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But Marguerite did not answer him; she was offended that&#10;he should call her a woman when she was only a girl; and there is a&#10;great difference. He asked her a second time, and then a third; but&#10;she remained dumb, and answered not a word. Then he would wait no&#10;longer, but flew away, to commence his wooing at once. It was in&#10;the early spring, when the crocus and the snowdrop were in full&#10;bloom.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;They are very pretty,&#34; thought the butterfly; &#34;charming&#10;little lasses; but they are rather formal.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then, as the young lads often do, he looked out for the&#10;elder girls. He next flew to the anemones; these were rather sour&#10;to his taste. The violet, a little too sentimental. The&#10;lime-blossoms, too small, and besides, there was such a large&#10;family of them. The apple-blossoms, though they looked like roses,&#10;bloomed to-day, but might fall off to-morrow, with the first wind&#10;that blew; and he thought that a marriage with one of them might&#10;last too short a time. The pea-blossom pleased him most of all; she&#10;was white and red, graceful and slender, and belonged to those&#10;domestic maidens who have a pretty appearance, and can yet be&#10;useful in the kitchen. He was just about to make her an offer,&#10;when, close by the maiden, he saw a pod, with a withered flower&#10;hanging at the end.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Who is that?&#34; he asked.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That is my sister,&#34; replied the pea-blossom.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, indeed; and you will be like her some day,&#34; said he;&#10;and he flew away directly, for he felt quite shocked.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A honeysuckle hung forth from the hedge, in full bloom;&#10;but there were so many girls like her, with long faces and sallow&#10;complexions. No; he did not like her. But which one did he&#10;like?&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Spring went by, and summer drew towards its close; autumn&#10;came; but he had not decided. The flowers now appeared in their&#10;most gorgeous robes, but all in vain; they had not the fresh,&#10;fragrant air of youth. For the heart asks for fragrance, even when&#10;it is no longer young; and there is very little of that to be found&#10;in the dahlias or the dry chrysanthemums; therefore the butterfly&#10;turned to the mint on the ground. You know, this plant has no&#10;blossom; but it is sweetness all over,&#8212;full of fragrance from head&#10;to foot, with the scent of a flower in every leaf.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I will take her,&#34; said the butterfly; and he made her an&#10;offer. But the mint stood silent and stiff, as she listened to him.&#10;At last she said,&#8212;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Friendship, if you please; nothing more. I am old, and&#10;you are old, but we may live for each other just the same; as to&#10;marrying&#8212;no; don&#39;t let us appear ridiculous at our age.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And so it happened that the butterfly got no wife at all.&#10;He had been too long choosing, which is always a bad plan. And the&#10;butterfly became what is called an old bachelor.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was late in the autumn, with rainy and cloudy weather.&#10;The cold wind blew over the bowed backs of the willows, so that&#10;they creaked again. It was not the weather for flying about in&#10;summer clothes; but fortunately the butterfly was not out in it. He&#10;had got a shelter by chance. It was in a room heated by a stove,&#10;and as warm as summer. He could exist here, he said, well&#10;enough.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But it is not enough merely to exist,&#34; said he, &#34;I need&#10;freedom, sunshine, and a little flower for a companion.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then he flew against the window-pane, and was seen and&#10;admired by those in the room, who caught him, and stuck him on a&#10;pin, in a box of curiosities. They could not do more for&#10;him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Now I am perched on a stalk, like the flowers,&#34; said the&#10;butterfly. &#34;It is not very pleasant, certainly; I should imagine it&#10;is something like being married; for here I am stuck fast.&#34; And&#10;with this thought he consoled himself a little.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That seems very poor consolation,&#34; said one of the plants&#10;in the room, that grew in a pot.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ah,&#34; thought the butterfly, &#34;one can&#39;t very well trust&#10;these plants in pots; they have too much to do with mankind.&#34;&#10;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode(' A&#10;Cheerful Temper'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;FROM my father I received the best inheritance, namely a&#10;&#34;good temper.&#34; &#34;And who was my father?&#34; That has nothing to do with&#10;the good temper; but I will say he was lively, good-looking round,&#10;and fat; he was both in appearance and character a complete&#10;contradiction to his profession. &#34;And pray what was his profession&#10;and his standing in respectable society?&#34; Well, perhaps, if in the&#10;beginning of a book these were written and printed, many, when they&#10;read it, would lay the book down and say, &#34;It seems to me a very&#10;miserable title, I don&#39;t like things of this sort.&#34; And yet my&#10;father was not a skin-dresser nor an executioner; on the contrary,&#10;his employment placed him at the head of the grandest people of the&#10;town, and it was his place by right. He had to precede the bishop,&#10;and even the princes of the blood; he always went first,&#8212;he was a&#10;hearse driver! There, now, the truth is out. And I will own, that&#10;when people saw my father perched up in front of the omnibus of&#10;death, dressed in his long, wide, black cloak, and his black-edged,&#10;three-cornered hat on his head, and then glanced at his round,&#10;jocund face, round as the sun, they could not think much of sorrow&#10;or the grave. That face said, &#34;It is nothing, it will all end&#10;better than people think.&#34; So I have inherited from him, not only&#10;my good temper, but a habit of going often to the churchyard, which&#10;is good, when done in a proper humor; and then also I take in the&#10;Intelligencer, just as he used to do.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;I am not very young, I have neither wife nor children, nor&#10;a library, but, as I said, I read the Intelligencer, which is&#10;enough for me; it is to me a delightful paper, and so it was to my&#10;father. It is of great use, for it contains all that a man requires&#10;to know; the names of the preachers at the church, and the new&#10;books which are published; where houses, servants, clothes, and&#10;provisions may be obtained. And then what a number of subscriptions&#10;to charities, and what innocent verses! Persons seeking interviews&#10;and engagements, all so plainly and naturally stated. Certainly, a&#10;man who takes in the Intelligencer may live merrily and be buried&#10;contentedly, and by the end of his life will have such a capital&#10;stock of paper that he can lie on a soft bed of it, unless he&#10;prefers wood shavings for his resting-place. The newspaper and the&#10;churchyard were always exciting objects to me. My walks to the&#10;latter were like bathing-places to my good humor. Every one can&#10;read the newspaper for himself, but come with me to the churchyard&#10;while the sun shines and the trees are green, and let us wander&#10;among the graves. Each of them is like a closed book, with the back&#10;uppermost, on which we can read the title of what the book&#10;contains, but nothing more. I had a great deal of information from&#10;my father, and I have noticed a great deal myself. I keep it in my&#10;diary, in which I write for my own use and pleasure a history of&#10;all who lie here, and a few more beside.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Now we are in the churchyard. Here, behind the white iron&#10;railings, once a rose-tree grew; it is gone now, but a little bit&#10;of evergreen, from a neighboring grave, stretches out its green&#10;tendrils, and makes some appearance; there rests a very unhappy&#10;man, and yet while he lived he might be said to occupy a very good&#10;position. He had enough to live upon, and something to spare; but&#10;owing to his refined tastes the least thing in the world annoyed&#10;him. If he went to a theatre of an evening, instead of enjoying&#10;himself he would be quite annoyed if the machinist had put too&#10;strong a light into one side of the moon, or if the representations&#10;of the sky hung over the scenes when they ought to have hung behind&#10;them; or if a palm-tree was introduced into a scene representing&#10;the Zoological Gardens of Berlin, or a cactus in a view of Tyrol,&#10;or a beech-tree in the north of Norway. As if these things were of&#10;any consequence! Why did he not leave them alone? Who would trouble&#10;themselves about such trifles? especially at a comedy, where every&#10;one is expected to be amused. Then sometimes the public applauded&#10;too much, or too little, to please him. &#34;They are like wet wood,&#34;&#10;he would say, looking round to see what sort of people were&#10;present, &#34;this evening; nothing fires them.&#34; Then he would vex and&#10;fret himself because they did not laugh at the right time, or&#10;because they laughed in the wrong places; and so he fretted and&#10;worried himself till at last the unhappy man fretted himself into&#10;the grave.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Here rests a happy man, that is to say, a man of high&#10;birth and position, which was very lucky for him, otherwise he&#10;would have been scarcely worth notice. It is beautiful to observe&#10;how wisely nature orders these things. He walked about in a coat&#10;embroidered all over, and in the drawing-rooms of society looked&#10;just like one of those rich pearl-embroidered bell-pulls, which are&#10;only made for show; and behind them always hangs a good thick cord&#10;for use. This man also had a stout, useful substitute behind him,&#10;who did duty for him, and performed all his dirty work. And there&#10;are still, even now, these serviceable cords behind other&#10;embroidered bell-ropes. It is all so wisely arranged, that a man&#10;may well be in a good humor.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Here rests,&#8212;ah, it makes one feel mournful to think of&#10;him!&#8212;but here rests a man who, during sixty-seven years, was never&#10;remembered to have said a good thing; he lived only in the hope of&#10;having a good idea. At last he felt convinced, in his own mind,&#10;that he really had one, and was so delighted that he positively&#10;died of joy at the thought of having at last caught an idea. Nobody&#10;got anything by it; indeed, no one even heard what the good thing&#10;was. Now I can imagine that this same idea may prevent him from&#10;resting quietly in his grave; for suppose that to produce a good&#10;effect, it is necessary to bring out his new idea at breakfast, and&#10;that he can only make his appearance on earth at midnight, as&#10;ghosts are believed generally to do; why then this good idea would&#10;not suit the hour, and the man would have to carry it down again&#10;with him into the grave&#8212;that must be a troubled grave.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The woman who lies here was so remarkably stingy, that&#10;during her life she would get up in the night and mew, that her&#10;neighbors might think she kept a cat. What a miser she&#10;was!&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Here rests a young lady, of a good family, who would&#10;always make her voice heard in society, and when she sang &#34;Mi manca&#10;la voce,&#34;&#60;a href=&#34;footnotes.xml#footnote_1&#34; class=&#34;footnote&#34; id=&#34;footnote_1_call&#34;&#62;[1]&#60;/a&#62; &#38;#160;it was the only true thing she ever&#10;said in her life.&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Here lies a maiden of another description. She was engaged&#10;to be married,&#8212;but, her story is one of every-day life; we will&#10;leave her to rest in the grave.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Here rests a widow, who, with music in her tongue, carried&#10;gall in her heart. She used to go round among the families near,&#10;and search out their faults, upon which she preyed with all the&#10;envy and malice of her nature. This is a family grave. The members&#10;of this family held so firmly together in their opinions, that they&#10;would believe in no other. If the newspapers, or even the whole&#10;world, said of a certain subject, &#34;It is so-and-so;&#34; and a little&#10;schoolboy declared he had learned quite differently, they would&#10;take his assertion as the only true one, because he belonged to the&#10;family. And it is well known that if the yard-cock belonging to&#10;this family happened to crow at midnight, they would declare it was&#10;morning, although the watchman and all the clocks in the town were&#10;proclaiming the hour of twelve at night.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The great poet Goethe concludes his Faust with the words,&#10;&#34;may be continued;&#34; so might our wanderings in the churchyard be&#10;continued. I come here often, and if any of my friends, or those&#10;who are not my friends, are too much for me, I go out and choose a&#10;plot of ground in which to bury him or her. Then I bury them, as it&#10;were; there they lie, dead and powerless, till they come back new&#10;and better characters. Their lives and their deeds, looked at after&#10;my own fashion, I write down in my diary, as every one ought to do.&#10;Then, if any of our friends act absurdly, no one need to be vexed&#10;about it. Let them bury the offenders out of sight, and keep their&#10;good temper. They can also read the Intelligencer, which is a paper&#10;written by the people, with their hands guided. When the time comes&#10;for the history of my life, to be bound by the grave, then they&#10;will write upon it as my epitaph&#8212;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The man with a cheerful temper.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And this is my story. &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Child in the Grave'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;IT was a very sad day, and every heart in the house felt&#10;the deepest grief; for the youngest child, a boy of four years old,&#10;the joy and hope of his parents, was dead. Two daughters, the elder&#10;of whom was going to be confirmed, still remained: they were both&#10;good, charming girls; but the lost child always seems the dearest;&#10;and when it is youngest, and a son, it makes the trial still more&#10;heavy. The sisters mourned as young hearts can mourn, and were&#10;especially grieved at the sight of their parents&#39; sorrow. The&#10;father&#39;s heart was bowed down, but the mother sunk completely under&#10;the deep grief. Day and night she had attended to the sick child,&#10;nursing and carrying it in her bosom, as a part of herself. She&#10;could not realize the fact that the child was dead, and must be&#10;laid in a coffin to rest in the ground. She thought God could not&#10;take her darling little one from her; and when it did happen&#10;notwithstanding her hopes and her belief, and there could be no&#10;more doubt on the subject, she said in her feverish agony, &#34;God&#10;does not know it. He has hard-hearted ministering spirits on earth,&#10;who do according to their own will, and heed not a mother&#39;s&#10;prayers.&#34; Thus in her great grief she fell away from her faith in&#10;God, and dark thoughts arose in her mind respecting death and a&#10;future state. She tried to believe that man was but dust, and that&#10;with his life all existence ended. But these doubts were no support&#10;to her, nothing on which she could rest, and she sunk into the&#10;fathomless depths of despair. In her darkest hours she ceased to&#10;weep, and thought not of the young daughters who were still left to&#10;her. The tears of her husband fell on her forehead, but she took no&#10;notice of him; her thoughts were with her dead child; her whole&#10;existence seemed wrapped up in the remembrances of the little one&#10;and of every innocent word it had uttered.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The day of the little child&#39;s funeral came. For nights&#10;previously the mother had not slept, but in the morning twilight of&#10;this day she sunk from weariness into a deep sleep; in the mean&#10;time the coffin was carried into a distant room, and there nailed&#10;down, that she might not hear the blows of the hammer. When she&#10;awoke, and wanted to see her child, the husband, with tears, said,&#10;&#34;We have closed the coffin; it was necessary to do so.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;When God is so hard to me, how can I expect men to be&#10;better?&#34; she said with groans and tears.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The coffin was carried to the grave, and the disconsolate&#10;mother sat with her young daughters. She looked at them, but she&#10;saw them not; for her thoughts were far away from the domestic&#10;hearth. She gave herself up to her grief, and it tossed her to and&#10;fro, as the sea tosses a ship without compass or rudder. So the day&#10;of the funeral passed away, and similar days followed, of dark,&#10;wearisome pain. With tearful eyes and mournful glances, the&#10;sorrowing daughters and the afflicted husband looked upon her who&#10;would not hear their words of comfort; and, indeed, what comforting&#10;words could they speak, when they were themselves so full of grief?&#10;It seemed as if she would never again know sleep, and yet it would&#10;have been her best friend, one who would have strengthened her body&#10;and poured peace into her soul. They at last persuaded her to lie&#10;down, and then she would lie as still as if she slept.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;One night, when her husband listened, as he often did, to&#10;her breathing, he quite believed that she had at length found rest&#10;and relief in sleep. He folded his arms and prayed, and soon sunk&#10;himself into healthful sleep; therefore he did not notice that his&#10;wife arose, threw on her clothes, and glided silently from the&#10;house, to go where her thoughts constantly lingered&#8212;to the grave of&#10;her child. She passed through the garden, to a path across a field&#10;that led to the churchyard. No one saw her as she walked, nor did&#10;she see any one; for her eyes were fixed upon the one object of her&#10;wanderings. It was a lovely starlight night in the beginning of&#10;September, and the air was mild and still. She entered the&#10;churchyard, and stood by the little grave, which looked like a&#10;large nosegay of fragrant flowers. She sat down, and bent her head&#10;low over the grave, as if she could see her child through the earth&#10;that covered him&#8212;her little boy, whose smile was so vividly before&#10;her, and the gentle expression of whose eyes, even on his sick-bed,&#10;she could not forget. How full of meaning that glance had been, as&#10;she leaned over him, holding in hers the pale hand which he had no&#10;longer strength to raise! As she had sat by his little cot, so now&#10;she sat by his grave; and here she could weep freely, and her tears&#10;fell upon it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Thou wouldst gladly go down and be with thy child,&#34; said&#10;a voice quite close to her,&#8212;a voice that sounded so deep and clear,&#10;that it went to her heart.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;She looked up, and by her side stood a man wrapped in a&#10;black cloak, with a hood closely drawn over his face; but her keen&#10;glance could distinguish the face under the hood. It was stern, yet&#10;awakened confidence, and the eyes beamed with youthful&#10;radiance.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Down to my child,&#34; she repeated; and tones of despair and&#10;entreaty sounded in the words.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Darest thou to follow me?&#34; asked the form. &#34;I am&#10;Death.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;She bowed her head in token of assent. Then suddenly it&#10;appeared as if all the stars were shining with the radiance of the&#10;full moon on the many-colored flowers that decked the grave. The&#10;earth that covered it was drawn back like a floating drapery. She&#10;sunk down, and the spectre covered her with a black cloak; night&#10;closed around her, the night of death. She sank deeper than the&#10;spade of the sexton could penetrate, till the churchyard became a&#10;roof above her. Then the cloak was removed, and she found herself&#10;in a large hall, of wide-spreading dimensions, in which there was a&#10;subdued light, like twilight, reigning, and in a moment her child&#10;appeared before her, smiling, and more beautiful than ever; with a&#10;silent cry she pressed him to her heart. A glorious strain of music&#10;sounded&#8212;now distant, now near. Never had she listened to such tones&#10;as these; they came from beyond a large dark curtain which&#10;separated the regions of death from the land of&#10;eternity.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;My sweet, darling mother,&#34; she heard the child say. It&#10;was the well-known, beloved voice; and kiss followed kiss, in&#10;boundless delight. Then the child pointed to the dark curtain.&#10;&#34;There is nothing so beautiful on earth as it is here. Mother, do&#10;you not see them all? Oh, it is happiness indeed.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But the mother saw nothing of what the child pointed out,&#10;only the dark curtain. She looked with earthly eyes, and could not&#10;see as the child saw,&#8212;he whom God has called to be with Himself.&#10;She could hear the sounds of music, but she heard not the words,&#10;the Word in which she was to trust.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I can fly now, mother,&#34; said the child; &#34;I can fly with&#10;other happy children into the presence of the Almighty. I would&#10;fain fly away now; but if you weep for me as you are weeping now,&#10;you may never see me again. And yet I would go so gladly. May I not&#10;fly away? And you will come to me soon, will you not, dear&#10;mother?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, stay, stay!&#34; implored the mother; &#34;only one moment&#10;more; only once more, that I may look upon thee, and kiss thee, and&#10;press thee to my heart.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then she kissed and fondled her child. Suddenly her name&#10;was called from above; what could it mean? her name uttered in a&#10;plaintive voice.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Hearest thou?&#34; said the child. &#34;It is my father who calls&#10;thee.&#34; And in a few moments deep sighs were heard, as of children&#10;weeping. &#34;They are my sisters,&#34; said the child. &#34;Mother, surely you&#10;have not forgotten them.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And then she remembered those she left behind, and a great&#10;terror came over her. She looked around her at the dark night. Dim&#10;forms flitted by. She seemed to recognize some of them, as they&#10;floated through the regions of death towards the dark curtain,&#10;where they vanished. Would her husband and her daughters flit past?&#10;No; their sighs and lamentations still sounded from above; and she&#10;had nearly forgotten them, for the sake of him who was&#10;dead.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Mother, now the bells of heaven are ringing,&#34; said the&#10;child; &#34;mother, the sun is going to rise.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;An overpowering light streamed in upon her, the child had&#10;vanished, and she was being borne upwards. All around her became&#10;cold; she lifted her head, and saw that she was lying in the&#10;churchyard, on the grave of her child. The Lord, in a dream, had&#10;been a guide to her feet and a light to her spirit. She bowed her&#10;knees, and prayed for forgiveness. She had wished to keep back a&#10;soul from its immortal flight; she had forgotten her duties towards&#10;the living who were left her. And when she had offered this prayer,&#10;her heart felt lighter. The sun burst forth, over her head a little&#10;bird carolled his song, and the church-bells sounded for the early&#10;service. Everything around her seemed holy, and her heart was&#10;chastened. She acknowledged the goodness of God, she acknowledged&#10;the duties she had to perform, and eagerly she returned home. She&#10;bent over her husband, who still slept; her warm, devoted kiss&#10;awakened him, and words of heartfelt love fell from the lips of&#10;both. Now she was gentle and strong as a wife can be; and from her&#10;lips came the words of faith: &#34;Whatever He doeth is right and&#10;best.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then her husband asked, &#34;From whence hast thou all at once&#10;derived such strength and comforting faith?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And as she kissed him and her children, she said, &#34;It came&#10;from God, through my child in the grave.&#34; &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Farm-Yard Cock and the Weather-Cock'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;THERE were two cocks&#8212;one on the dung-hill, the other on&#10;the roof. They were both arrogant, but which of the two rendered&#10;most service? Tell us your opinion&#8212;we&#39;ll keep to ours just the same&#10;though.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The poultry yard was divided by some planks from another&#10;yard in which there was a dung-hill, and on the dung-hill lay and&#10;grew a large cucumber which was conscious of being a hot-bed&#10;plant.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;One is born to that,&#34; said the cucumber to itself. &#34;Not&#10;all can be born cucumbers; there must be other things, too. The&#10;hens, the ducks, and all the animals in the next yard are creatures&#10;too. Now I have a great opinion of the yard cock on the plank; he&#10;is certainly of much more importance than the weather-cock who is&#10;placed so high and can&#39;t even creak, much less crow. The latter has&#10;neither hens nor chicks, and only thinks of himself and perspires&#10;verdigris. No, the yard cock is really a cock! His step is a dance!&#10;His crowing is music, and wherever he goes one knows what a&#10;trumpeter is like! If he would only come in here! Even if he ate me&#10;up stump, stalk, and all, and I had to dissolve in his body, it&#10;would be a happy death,&#34; said the cucumber.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the night there was a terrible storm. The hens, chicks,&#10;and even the cock sought shelter; the wind tore down the planks&#10;between the two yards with a crash; the tiles came tumbling down,&#10;but the weather-cock sat firm. He did not even turn round, for he&#10;could not; and yet he was young and freshly cast, but prudent and&#10;sedate. He had been born old, and did not at all resemble the birds&#10;flying in the air&#8212;the sparrows, and the swallows; no, he despised&#10;them, these mean little piping birds, these common whistlers. He&#10;admitted that the pigeons, large and white and shining like&#10;mother-o&#39;-pearl, looked like a kind of weather-cock; but they were&#10;fat and stupid, and all their thoughts and endeavours were directed&#10;to filling themselves with food, and besides, they were tiresome&#10;things to converse with. The birds of passage had also paid the&#10;weather-cock a visit and told him of foreign countries, of airy&#10;caravans and robber stories that made one&#39;s hair stand on end. All&#10;this was new and interesting; that is, for the first time, but&#10;afterwards, as the weather-cock found out, they repeated themselves&#10;and always told the same stories, and that&#39;s very tedious, and&#10;there was no one with whom one could associate, for one and all&#10;were stale and small-minded.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The world is no good!&#34; he said. &#34;Everything in it is so&#10;stupid.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The weather-cock was puffed up, and that quality would&#10;have made him interesting in the eyes of the cucumber if it had&#10;known it, but it had eyes only for the yard cock, who was now in&#10;the yard with it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The wind had blown the planks, but the storm was&#10;over.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What do you think of that crowing?&#34; said the yard cock to&#10;the hens and chickens. &#34;It was a little rough&#8212;it wanted&#10;elegance.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the hens and chickens came up on the dung-hill, and&#10;the cock strutted about like a lord.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Garden plant!&#34; he said to the cucumber, and in that one&#10;word his deep learning showed itself, and it forgot that he was&#10;pecking at her and eating it up. &#34;A happy death!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The hens and the chickens came, for where one runs the&#10;others run too; they clucked, and chirped, and looked at the cock,&#10;and were proud that he was of their kind.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Cock-a-doodle-doo!&#34; he crowed, &#34;the chickens will grow up&#10;into great hens at once, if I cry it out in the poultry-yard of the&#10;world!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And hens and chicks clucked and chirped, and the cock&#10;announced a great piece of news.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;A cock can lay an egg! And do you know what&#39;s in that&#10;egg? A basilisk. No one can stand the sight of such a thing; people&#10;know that, and now you know it too&#8212;you know what is in me, and what&#10;a champion of all cocks I am!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;With that the yard cock flapped his wings, made his comb&#10;swell up, and crowed again; and they all shuddered, the hens and&#10;the little chicks&#8212;but they were very proud that one of their number&#10;was such a champion of all cocks. They clucked and chirped till the&#10;weather-cock heard; he heard it; but he did not stir.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Everything is very stupid,&#34; the weather-cock said to&#10;himself. &#34;The yard cock lays no eggs, and I am too lazy to do so;&#10;if I liked, I could lay a wind-egg.

Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Daisy'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Now listen! In the country, close by the high road, stood&#10;a farmhouse; perhaps you have passed by and seen it yourself. There&#10;was a little flower garden with painted wooden palings in front of&#10;it; close by was a ditch, on its fresh green bank grew a little&#10;daisy; the sun shone as warmly and brightly upon it as on the&#10;magnificent garden flowers, and therefore it thrived well. One&#10;morning it had quite opened, and its little snow-white petals stood&#10;round the yellow centre, like the rays of the sun. It did not mind&#10;that nobody saw it in the grass, and that it was a poor despised&#10;flower; on the contrary, it was quite happy, and turned towards the&#10;sun, looking upward and listening to the song of the lark high up&#10;in the air.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The little daisy was as happy as if the day had been a&#10;great holiday, but it was only Monday. All the children were at&#10;school, and while they were sitting on the forms and learning their&#10;lessons, it sat on its thin green stalk and learnt from the sun and&#10;from its surroundings how kind God is, and it rejoiced that the&#10;song of the little lark expressed so sweetly and distinctly its own&#10;feelings. With a sort of reverence the daisy looked up to the bird&#10;that could fly and sing, but it did not feel envious. &#34;I can see&#10;and hear,&#34; it thought; &#34;the sun shines upon me, and the forest&#10;kisses me. How rich I am!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the garden close by grew many large and magnificent&#10;flowers, and, strange to say, the less fragrance they had the&#10;haughtier and prouder they were. The peonies puffed themselves up&#10;in order to be larger than the roses, but size is not everything!&#10;The tulips had the finest colours, and they knew it well, too, for&#10;they were standing bolt upright like candles, that one might see&#10;them the better. In their pride they did not see the little daisy,&#10;which looked over to them and thought, &#34;How rich and beautiful they&#10;are! I am sure the pretty bird will fly down and call upon them.&#10;Thank God, that I stand so near and can at least see all the&#10;splendour.&#34; And while the daisy was still thinking, the lark came&#10;flying down, crying &#34;Tweet,&#34; but not to the peonies and tulips&#8212;no,&#10;into the grass to the poor daisy. Its joy was so great that it did&#10;not know what to think. The little bird hopped round it and sang,&#10;&#34;How beautifully soft the grass is, and what a lovely little flower&#10;with its golden heart and silver dress is growing here.&#34; The yellow&#10;centre in the daisy did indeed look like gold, while the little&#10;petals shone as brightly as silver.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;How happy the daisy was! No one has the least idea. The&#10;bird kissed it with its beak, sang to it, and then rose again up to&#10;the blue sky. It was certainly more than a quarter of an hour&#10;before the daisy recovered its senses. Half ashamed, yet glad at&#10;heart, it looked over to the other flowers in the garden; surely&#10;they had witnessed its pleasure and the honour that had been done&#10;to it; they understood its joy. But the tulips stood more stiffly&#10;than ever, their faces were pointed and red, because they were&#10;vexed. The peonies were sulky; it was well that they could not&#10;speak, otherwise they would have given the daisy a good lecture.&#10;The little flower could very well see that they were ill at ease,&#10;and pitied them sincerely.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Shortly after this a girl came into the garden, with a&#10;large sharp knife. She went to the tulips and began cutting them&#10;off, one after another. &#34;Ugh!&#34; sighed the daisy, &#34;that is terrible;&#10;now they are done for.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The girl carried the tulips away. The daisy was glad that&#10;it was outside, and only a small flower&#8212;it felt very grateful. At&#10;sunset it folded its petals, and fell asleep, and dreamt all night&#10;of the sun and the little bird.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;On the following morning, when the flower once more&#10;stretched forth its tender petals, like little arms, towards the&#10;air and light, the daisy recognised the bird&#39;s voice, but what it&#10;sang sounded so sad. Indeed the poor bird had good reason to be&#10;sad, for it had been caught and put into a cage close by the open&#10;window. It sang of the happy days when it could merrily fly about,&#10;of fresh green corn in the fields, and of the time when it could&#10;soar almost up to the clouds. The poor lark was most unhappy as a&#10;prisoner in a cage. The little daisy would have liked so much to&#10;help it, but what could be done? Indeed, that was very difficult&#10;for such a small flower to find out. It entirely forgot how&#10;beautiful everything around it was, how warmly the sun was shining,&#10;and how splendidly white its own petals were. It could only think&#10;of the poor captive bird, for which it could do nothing. Then two&#10;little boys came out of the garden; one of them had a large sharp&#10;knife, like that with which the girl had cut the tulips. They came&#10;straight towards the little daisy, which could not understand what&#10;they wanted.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Here is a fine piece of turf for the lark,&#34; said one of&#10;the boys, and began to cut out a square round the daisy, so that it&#10;remained in the centre of the grass.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Pluck the flower off&#34; said the other boy, and the daisy&#10;trembled for fear, for to be pulled off meant death to it; and it&#10;wished so much to live, as it was to go with the square of turf&#10;into the poor captive lark&#39;s cage.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No let it stay,&#34; said the other boy, &#34;it looks so&#10;pretty&#34;.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And so it stayed, and was brought into the lark&#39;s cage.&#10;The poor bird was lamenting its lost liberty, and beating its wings&#10;against the wires; and the little daisy could not speak or utter a&#10;consoling word, much as it would have liked to do so. So the&#10;forenoon passed.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I have no water,&#34; said the captive lark, &#34;they have all&#10;gone out, and forgotten to give me anything to drink. My throat is&#10;dry and burning. I feel as if I had fire and ice within me, and the&#10;air is so oppressive. Alas! I must die, and part with the warm&#10;sunshine, the fresh green meadows, and all the beauty that God has&#10;created.&#34; And it thrust its beak into the piece of grass, to&#10;refresh itself a little. Then it noticed the little daisy, and&#10;nodded to it, and kissed it with its beak and said: &#34;You must also&#10;fade in here, poor little flower. You and the piece of grass are&#10;all they have given me in exchange for the whole world, which I&#10;enjoyed outside. Each little blade of grass shall be a green tree&#10;for me, each of your white petals a fragrant flower. Alas! you only&#10;remind me of what I have lost.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I wish I could console the poor lark,&#34; thought the daisy.&#10;It could not move one of its leaves, but the fragrance of its&#10;delicate petals streamed forth, and was much stronger than such&#10;flowers usually have: the bird noticed it, although it was dying&#10;with thirst, and in its pain tore up the green blades of grass, but&#10;did not touch the flower.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The evening came, and nobody appeared to bring the poor&#10;bird a drop of water; it opened its beautiful wings, and fluttered&#10;about in its anguish; a faint and mournful &#34;Tweet, tweet,&#34; was all&#10;it could utter, then it bent its little head towards the flower,&#10;and its heart broke for want and longing. The flower could not, as&#10;on the previous evening, fold up its petals and sleep; it dropped&#10;sorrowfully. The boys only came the next morning; when they saw the&#10;dead bird, they began to cry bitterly, dug a nice grave for it, and&#10;adorned it with flowers. The bird&#39;s body was placed in a pretty red&#10;box; they wished to bury it with royal honours. While it was alive&#10;and sang they forgot it, and let it suffer want in the cage; now,&#10;they cried over it and covered it with flowers. The piece of turf,&#10;with the little daisy in it, was thrown out on the dusty highway.&#10;Nobody thought of the flower which had felt so much for the bird&#10;and had so greatly desired to comfort it. &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)

There was a crack in the upper leather, which&#10;had to be sewn together.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What coarse work!&#34; said the darning-needle, &#34;I shall&#10;never get through. I shall break!&#8212;I am breaking!&#34; and sure enough&#10;she broke. &#34;Did I not say so?&#34; said the darning-needle, &#34;I know I&#10;am too fine for such work as that.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;This needle is quite useless for sewing now,&#34; said the&#10;fingers; but they still held it fast, and the cook dropped some&#10;sealing-wax on the needle, and fastened her handkerchief with it in&#10;front.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;So now I am a breast-pin,&#34; said the darning-needle; &#34;I&#10;knew very well I should come to honor some day: merit is sure to&#10;rise;&#34; and she laughed, quietly to herself, for of course no one&#10;ever saw a darning-needle laugh. And there she sat as proudly as if&#10;she were in a state coach, and looked all around her. &#34;May I be&#10;allowed to ask if you are made of gold?&#34; she inquired of her&#10;neighbor, a pin; &#34;you have a very pretty appearance, and a curious&#10;head, although you are rather small. You must take pains to grow,&#10;for it is not every one who has sealing-wax dropped upon him;&#34; and&#10;as she spoke, the darning-needle drew herself up so proudly that&#10;she fell out of the handkerchief right into the sink, which the&#10;cook was cleaning. &#34;Now I am going on a journey,&#34; said the needle,&#10;as she floated away with the dirty water, &#34;I do hope I shall not be&#10;lost.&#34; But she really was lost in a gutter. &#34;I am too fine for this&#10;world,&#34; said the darning-needle, as she lay in the gutter; &#34;but I&#10;know who I am, and that is always some comfort.&#34; So the&#10;darning-needle kept up her proud behavior, and did not lose her&#10;good humor. Then there floated over her all sorts of things,&#8212;chips&#10;and straws, and pieces of old newspaper. &#34;See how they sail,&#34; said&#10;the darning-needle; &#34;they do not know what is under them. I am&#10;here, and here I shall stick. See, there goes a chip, thinking of&#10;nothing in the world but himself&#8212;only a chip. There&#39;s a straw going&#10;by now; how he turns and twists about! Don&#39;t be thinking too much&#10;of yourself, or you may chance to run against a stone. There swims&#10;a piece of newspaper; what is written upon it has been forgotten&#10;long ago, and yet it gives itself airs. I sit here patiently and&#10;quietly. I know who I am, so I shall not move.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;One day something lying close to the darning-needle&#10;glittered so splendidly that she thought it was a diamond; yet it&#10;was only a piece of broken bottle. The darning-needle spoke to it,&#10;because it sparkled, and represented herself as a breast-pin. &#34;I&#10;suppose you are really a diamond?&#34; she said.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Why yes, something of the kind,&#34; he replied; and so each&#10;believed the other to be very valuable, and then they began to talk&#10;about the world, and the conceited people in it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I have been in a lady&#39;s work-box,&#34; said the&#10;darning-needle, &#34;and this lady was the cook. She had on each hand&#10;five fingers, and anything so conceited as these five fingers I&#10;have never seen; and yet they were only employed to take me out of&#10;the box and to put me back again.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Were they not high-born?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;High-born!&#34; said the darning-needle, &#34;no indeed, but so&#10;haughty. They were five brothers, all born fingers; they kept very&#10;proudly together, though they were of different lengths. The one&#10;who stood first in the rank was named the thumb, he was short and&#10;thick, and had only one joint in his back, and could therefore make&#10;but one bow; but he said that if he were cut off from a man&#39;s hand,&#10;that man would be unfit for a soldier. Sweet-tooth, his neighbor,&#10;dipped himself into sweet or sour, pointed to the sun and moon, and&#10;formed the letters when the fingers wrote. Longman, the middle&#10;finger, looked over the heads of all the others. Gold-band, the&#10;next finger, wore a golden circle round his waist. And little&#10;Playman did nothing at all, and seemed proud of it. They were&#10;boasters, and boasters they will remain; and therefore I left&#10;them.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And now we sit here and glitter,&#34; said the piece of&#10;broken bottle.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;At the same moment more water streamed into the gutter, so&#10;that it overflowed, and the piece of bottle was carried&#10;away.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;So he is promoted,&#34; said the darning-needle, &#34;while I&#10;remain here; I am too fine, but that is my pride, and what do I&#10;care?&#34; And so she sat there in her pride, and had many such&#10;thoughts as these,&#8212;&#34;I could almost fancy that I came from a&#10;sunbeam, I am so fine. It seems as if the sunbeams were always&#10;looking for me under the water. Ah! I am so fine that even my&#10;mother cannot find me. Had I still my old eye, which was broken&#10;off, I believe I should weep; but no, I would not do that, it is&#10;not genteel to cry.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;One day a couple of street boys were paddling in the&#10;gutter, for they sometimes found old nails, farthings, and other&#10;treasures. It was dirty work, but they took great pleasure in it.&#10;&#34;Hallo!&#34; cried one, as he pricked himself with the darning-needle,&#10;&#34;here&#39;s a fellow for you.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I am not a fellow, I am a young lady,&#34; said the&#10;darning-needle; but no one heard her.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The sealing-wax had come off, and she was quite black; but&#10;black makes a person look slender, so she thought herself even&#10;finer than before.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Here comes an egg-shell sailing along,&#34; said one of the&#10;boys; so they stuck the darning-needle into the&#10;egg-shell.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;White walls, and I am black myself,&#34; said the&#10;darning-needle, &#34;that looks well; now I can be seen, but I hope I&#10;shall not be sea-sick, or I shall break again.&#34; She was not&#10;sea-sick, and she did not break. &#34;It is a good thing against&#10;sea-sickness to have a steel stomach, and not to forget one&#39;s own&#10;importance. Now my sea-sickness has past: delicate people can bear&#10;a great deal.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Crack went the egg-shell, as a waggon passed over it.&#10;&#34;Good heavens, how it crushes!&#34; said the darning-needle. &#34;I shall&#10;be sick now. I am breaking!&#34; but she did not break, though the&#10;waggon went over her as she lay at full length; and there let her&#10;lie. &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;Delaying Is Not Forgetting'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;THERE was an old mansion surrounded by a marshy ditch with&#10;a drawbridge which was but seldom let down:&#8212;not all guests are good&#10;people. Under the roof were loopholes to shoot through, and to pour&#10;down boiling water or even molten lead on the enemy, should he&#10;approach. Inside the house the rooms were very high and had&#10;ceilings of beams, and that was very useful considering the great&#10;deal of smoke which rose up from the chimney fire where the large,&#10;damp logs of wood smouldered. On the walls hung pictures of knights&#10;in armour and proud ladies in gorgeous dresses; the most stately of&#10;all walked about alive. She was called Meta Mogen; she was the&#10;mistress of the house, to her belonged the castle.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Towards the evening robbers came; they killed three of her&#10;people and also the yard&#8212;dog, and attached Mrs. Meta to the kennel&#10;by the chain, while they themselves made good cheer in the hall and&#10;drank the wine and the good ale out of her cellar. Mrs. Meta was&#10;now on the chain, she could not even bark.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But lo! the servant of one of the robbers secretly&#10;approached her; they must not see it, otherwise they would have&#10;killed him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Mrs. Meta Mogen,&#34; said the fellow, &#34;do you still remember&#10;how my father, when your husband was still alive, had to ride on&#10;the wooden horse? You prayed for him, but it was no good, he was to&#10;ride until his limbs were paralysed; but you stole down to him, as&#10;I steal now to you, you yourself put little stones under each of&#10;his feet that he might have support, nobody saw it, or they&#10;pretended not to see it, for you were then the young gracious&#10;mistress. My father has told me this, and I have not forgotten it!&#10;Now I will free you, Mrs. Meta Mogen!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then they pulled the horses out of the stable and rode off&#10;in rain and wind to obtain the assistance of friends.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Thus the small service done to the old man was richly&#10;rewarded!&#34; said Meta Mogen.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Delaying is not forgetting,&#34; said the fellow.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The robbers were hanged.&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;There was an old mansion, it is still there; it did not&#10;belong to Mrs. Meta Mogen, it belonged to another old noble&#10;family.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;We are now in the present time. The sun is shining on the&#10;gilt knob of the tower, little wooded islands lie like bouquets on&#10;the water, and wild swans are swimming round them. In the garden&#10;grow roses; the mistress of the house is herself the finest rose&#10;petal, she beams with joy, the joy of good deeds: however, not done&#10;in the wide world, but in her heart, and what is preserved there is&#10;not forgotten. Delaying is not forgetting!&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Now she goes from the mansion to a little peasant hut in&#10;the field. Therein lives a poor paralysed girl; the window of her&#10;little room looks northward, the sun does not enter here. The girl&#10;can only see a small piece of field which is surrounded by a high&#10;fence. But to-day the sun shines here&#8212;the warm, beautiful sun of&#10;God is within the little room; it comes from the south through the&#10;new window, where formerly the wall was.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The paralysed girl sits in the warm sunshine and can see&#10;the wood and the lake; the world had become so large, so beautiful,&#10;and only through a single word from the kind mistress of the&#10;mansion.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The word was so easy, the deed so small,&#34; she said, &#34;the&#10;joy it afforded me was infinitely great and sweet!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And therefore she does many a good deed, thinks of all in&#10;the humble cottages and in the rich mansions, where there are also&#10;afflicted ones. It is concealed and hidden, but God does not forget&#10;it. Delayed is not forgotten!&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;An old house stood there; it was in the large town with&#10;its busy traffic. There are rooms and halls in it, but we do not&#10;enter them, we remain in the kitchen, where it is warm and light,&#10;clean and tidy; the copper utensils are shining, the table as if&#10;polished with beeswax; the sink looks like a freshly scoured&#10;meatboard. All this a single servant has done, and yet she has time&#10;to spare as if she wished to go to church; she wears a bow on her&#10;cap, a black bow, that signifies mourning. But she has no one to&#10;mourn, neither father nor mother, neither relations nor sweetheart.&#10;She is a poor girl. One day she was engaged to a poor fellow; they&#10;loved each other dearly.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;One day he came to her and said:&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;We both have nothing! The rich widow over the way in the&#10;basement has made advances to me; she will make me rich, but you&#10;are in my heart; what do you advise me to do?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I advise you to do what you think will turn out to your&#10;happiness,&#34; said the girl. &#34;Be kind and good to her, but remember&#10;this; from the hour we part we shall never see each other&#10;again.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Years passed; then one day she met the old friend and&#10;sweetheart in the street; he looked ill and miserable, and she&#10;could not help asking him, &#34;How are you?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Rich and prospering in every respect,&#34; he said; &#34;the&#10;woman is brave and good, but you are in my heart. I have fought the&#10;battle, it will soon be ended; we shall not see each other again&#10;now until we meet before God!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A week has passed; this morning his death was in the&#10;newspaper, that is the reason of the girl&#39;s mourning! Her old&#10;sweetheart is dead and has left a wife and three step-children, as&#10;the paper says; it sounds as if there is a crack, but the metal is&#10;pure.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The black bow signifies mourning, the girl&#39;s face points&#10;to the same in a still higher degree; it is preserved in the heart&#10;and will never be forgotten. Delaying is not&#10;forgetting!&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;These are three stories you see, three leaves on the same&#10;stalk.

When any one takes one of these&#10;and holds it to his eye, and looks at a drop of water from the pond&#10;yonder, he sees above a thousand wonderful creatures that are&#10;otherwise never discerned in the water. But there they are, and it&#10;is no delusion. It almost looks like a great plateful of spiders&#10;jumping about in a crowd. And how fierce they are! They tear off&#10;each other&#39;s legs. and arms and bodies, before and behind; and yet&#10;they are merry and joyful in their way.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Now, there once was an old man whom all the people called&#10;Kribble-Krabble, for that was his name. He always wanted the best&#10;of everything, and when he could not manage it otherwise, he did it&#10;by magic.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;There he sat one day, and held his magnifying-glass to his&#10;eye, and looked at a drop of water that had been taken out of a&#10;puddle by the ditch. But what a kribbling and krabbling was there!&#10;All the thousands of little creatures hopped and sprang and tugged&#10;at one another, and ate each other up.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That is horrible!&#34; said old Kribble-Krabble. &#34;Can one not&#10;persuade them to live in peace and quietness, so that each one may&#10;mind his own business?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And he thought it over and over, but it would not do, and&#10;so he had recourse to magic.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I must give them color, that they may be seen more&#10;plainly,&#34; said he; and he poured something like a little drop of&#10;red wine into the drop of water, but it was witches&#39; blood from the&#10;lobes of the ear, the finest kind, at ninepence a drop. And now the&#10;wonderful little creatures were pink all over. It looked like a&#10;whole town of naked wild men.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What have you there?&#34; asked another old magician, who had&#10;no name&#8212;and that was the best thing about him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, if you can guess what it is,&#34; said Kribble-Krabble,&#10;&#34;I&#39;ll make you a present of it.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But it is not so easy to find out if one does not&#10;know.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the magician who had no name looked through the&#10;magnifying-glass.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It looked really like a great town reflected there, in&#10;which all the people were running about without clothes. It was&#10;terrible! But it was still more terrible to see how one beat and&#10;pushed the other, and bit and hacked, and tugged and mauled him.&#10;Those at the top were being pulled down, and those at the bottom&#10;were struggling upwards.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Look! look! his leg is longer than mine! Bah! Away with&#10;it! There is one who has a little bruise. It hurts him, but it&#10;shall hurt him still more.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And they hacked away at him, and they pulled at him, and&#10;ate him up, because of the little bruise. And there was one sitting&#10;as still as any little maiden, and wishing only for peace and&#10;quietness. But now she had to come out, and they tugged at her, and&#10;pulled her about, and ate her up.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That&#39;s funny!&#34; said the magician.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes; but what do you think it is?&#34; said Kribble-Krabble.&#10;&#34;Can you find that out?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Why, one can see that easily enough,&#34; said the other.&#10;&#34;That&#39;s Paris, or some other great city, for they&#39;re all alike.&#10;It&#39;s a great city!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It&#39;s a drop of puddle water!&#34; said&#10;Kribble-Krabble.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)

That was a journey, a flight without&#10;magic. We flew on the wings of steam over the sea and across the&#10;land.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Yes, our time is the time of fairy tales.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;We are in the midst of Paris, in a great hotel. Blooming&#10;flowers ornament the staircases, and soft carpets the&#10;floors.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Our room is a very cosy one, and through the open balcony&#10;door we have a view of a great square. Spring lives down there; it&#10;has come to Paris, and arrived at the same time with us. It has&#10;come in the shape of a glorious young chestnut tree, with delicate&#10;leaves newly opened. How the tree gleams, dressed in its spring&#10;garb, before all the other trees in the place! One of these latter&#10;had been struck out of the list of living trees. It lies on the&#10;ground with roots exposed. On the place where it stood, the young&#10;chestnut tree is to be planted, and to flourish.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It still stands towering aloft on the heavy wagon which&#10;has brought it this morning a distance of several miles to Paris.&#10;For years it had stood there, in the protection of a mighty oak&#10;tree, under which the old venerable clergyman had often sat, with&#10;children listening to his stories.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The young chestnut tree had also listened to the stories;&#10;for the Dryad who lived in it was a child also. She remembered the&#10;time when the tree was so little that it only projected a short way&#10;above the grass and ferns around. These were as tall as they would&#10;ever be; but the tree grew every year, and enjoyed the air and the&#10;sunshine, and drank the dew and the rain. Several times it was&#10;also, as it must be, well shaken by the wind and the rain; for that&#10;is a part of education.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Dryad rejoiced in her life, and rejoiced in the&#10;sunshine, and the singing of the birds; but she was most rejoiced&#10;at human voices; she understood the language of men as well as she&#10;understood that of animals.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Butterflies, cockchafers, dragon-flies, everything that&#10;could fly came to pay a visit. They could all talk. They told of&#10;the village, of the vineyard, of the forest, of the old castle with&#10;its parks and canals and ponds. Down in the water dwelt also living&#10;beings, which, in their way, could fly under the water from one&#10;place to another&#8212;beings with knowledge and delineation. They said&#10;nothing at all; they were so clever!&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the swallow, who had dived, told about the pretty&#10;little goldfish, of the thick turbot, the fat brill, and the old&#10;carp. The swallow could describe all that very well, but, &#34;Self is&#10;the man,&#34; she said. &#34;One ought to see these things one&#39;s self.&#34; But&#10;how was the Dryad ever to see such beings? She was obliged to be&#10;satisfied with being able to look over the beautiful country and&#10;see the busy industry of men.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was glorious; but most glorious of all when the old&#10;clergyman sat under the oak tree and talked of France, and of the&#10;great deeds of her sons and daughters, whose names will be&#10;mentioned with admiration through all time.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the Dryad heard of the shepherd girl, Joan of Arc,&#10;and of Charlotte Corday; she heard about Henry the Fourth, and&#10;Napoleon the First; she heard names whose echo sounds in the hearts&#10;of the people.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The village children listened attentively, and the Dryad&#10;no less attentively; she became a school-child with the rest. In&#10;the clouds that went sailing by she saw, picture by picture,&#10;everything that she heard talked about. The cloudy sky was her&#10;picture-book.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;She felt so happy in beautiful France, the fruitful land&#10;of genius, with the crater of freedom. But in her heart the sting&#10;remained that the bird, that every animal that could fly, was much&#10;better off than she. Even the fly could look about more in the&#10;world, far beyond the Dryad&#39;s horizon.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;France was so great and so glorious, but she could only&#10;look across a little piece of it. The land stretched out,&#10;world-wide, with vineyards, forests and great cities. Of all these&#10;Paris was the most splendid and the mightiest. The birds could get&#10;there; but she, never!&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Among the village children was a little ragged, poor girl,&#10;but a pretty one to look at. She was always laughing or singing and&#10;twining red flowers in her black hair.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Don&#39;t go to Paris!&#34; the old clergyman warned her. &#34;Poor&#10;child! if you go there, it will be your ruin.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But she went for all that.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Dryad often thought of her; for she had the same wish,&#10;and felt the same longing for the great city.&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Dryad&#39;s tree was bearing its first chestnut blossoms;&#10;the birds were twittering round them in the most beautiful&#10;sunshine. Then a stately carriage came rolling along that way, and&#10;in it sat a grand lady driving the spirited, light-footed horses.&#10;On the back seat a little smart groom balanced himself. The Dryad&#10;knew the lady, and the old clergyman knew her also. He shook his&#10;head gravely when he saw her, and said:&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;So you went there after all, and it was your ruin, poor&#10;Mary!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That one poor?&#34; thought the Dryad. &#34;No; she wears a dress&#10;fit for a countess&#34; (she had become one in the city of magic&#10;changes). &#34;Oh, if I were only there, amid all the splendor and&#10;pomp! They shine up into the very clouds at night; when I look up,&#10;I can tell in what direction the town lies.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Towards that direction the Dryad looked every evening. She&#10;saw in the dark night the gleaming cloud on the horizon; in the&#10;clear moonlight nights she missed the sailing clouds, which showed&#10;her pictures of the city and pictures from history.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The child grasps at the picture-books, the Dryad grasped&#10;at the cloud-world, her thought-book. A sudden, cloudless sky was&#10;for her a blank leaf; and for several days she had only had such&#10;leaves before her.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was in the warm summer-time: not a breeze moved through&#10;the glowing hot days. Every leaf, every flower, lay as if it were&#10;torpid, and the people seemed torpid, too.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the clouds arose and covered the region round about&#10;where the gleaming mist announced &#34;Here lies Paris.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The clouds piled themselves up like a chain of mountains,&#10;hurried on through the air, and spread themselves abroad over the&#10;whole landscape, as far as the Dryad&#39;s eye could reach.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Like enormous blue-black blocks of rock, the clouds lay&#10;piled over one another. Gleams of lightning shot forth from&#10;them.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;These also are the servants of the Lord God,&#34; the old&#10;clergyman had said. And there came a bluish dazzling flash of&#10;lightning, a lighting up as if of the sun itself, which could burst&#10;blocks of rock asunder. The lightning struck and split to the roots&#10;the old venerable oak. The crown fell asunder. It seemed as if the&#10;tree were stretching forth its arms to clasp the messengers of the&#10;light.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;No bronze cannon can sound over the land at the birth of a&#10;royal child as the thunder sounded at the death of the old oak. The&#10;rain streamed down; a refreshing wind was blowing; the storm had&#10;gone by, and there was quite a holiday glow on all things. The old&#10;clergyman spoke a few words for honorable remembrance, and a&#10;painter made a drawing, as a lasting record of the tree.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Everything passes away,&#34; said the Dryad, &#34;passes away&#10;like a cloud, and never comes back!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The old clergyman, too, did not come back. The green roof&#10;of his school was gone, and his teaching-chair had vanished. The&#10;children did not come; but autumn came, and winter came, and then&#10;spring also. In all this change of seasons the Dryad looked toward&#10;the region where, at night, Paris gleamed with its bright mist far&#10;on the horizon.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Forth from the town rushed engine after engine, train&#10;after train, whistling and screaming at all hours in the day. In&#10;the evening, towards midnight, at daybreak, and all the day&#10;through, came the trains. Out of each one, and into each one,&#10;streamed people from the country of every king. A new wonder of the&#10;world had summoned them to Paris.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In what form did this wonder exhibit itself?&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;A splendid blossom of art and industry,&#34; said one, &#34;has&#10;unfolded itself in the Champ de Mars, a gigantic sunflower, from&#10;whose petals one can learn geography and statistics, and can become&#10;as wise as a lord mayor, and raise one&#39;s self to the level of art&#10;and poetry, and study the greatness and power of the various&#10;lands.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;A fairy tale flower,&#34; said another, &#34;a many-colored&#10;lotus-plant, which spreads out its green leaves like a velvet&#10;carpet over the sand. The opening spring has brought it forth, the&#10;summer will see it in all its splendor, the autumn winds will sweep&#10;it away, so that not a leaf, not a fragment of its root shall&#10;remain.&#34;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In front of the Military School extends in time of peace&#10;the arena of war&#8212;a field without a blade of grass, a piece of sandy&#10;steppe, as if cut out of the Desert of Africa, where Fata Morgana&#10;displays her wondrous airy castles and hanging gardens. In the&#10;Champ de Mars, however, these were to be seen more splendid, more&#10;wonderful than in the East, for human art had converted the airy&#10;deceptive scenes into reality.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The Aladdin&#39;s Palace of the present has been built,&#34; it&#10;was said. &#34;Day by day, hour by hour, it unfolds more of its&#10;wonderful splendor.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The endless halls shine in marble and many colors. &#34;Master&#10;Bloodless&#34; here moves his limbs of steel and iron in the great&#10;circular hall of machinery. Works of art in metal, in stone, in&#10;Gobelins tapestry, announce the vitality of mind that is stirring&#10;in every land. Halls of paintings, splendor of flowers, everything&#10;that mind and skill can create in the workshop of the artisan, has&#10;been placed here for show. Even the memorials of ancient days, out&#10;of old graves and turf-moors, have appeared at this general&#10;meeting.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The overpowering great variegated whole must be divided&#10;into small portions, and pressed together like a plaything, if it&#10;is to be understood and described.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Like a great table on Christmas Eve, the Champ de Mars&#10;carried a wonder-castle of industry and art, and around this&#10;knickknacks from all countries had been ranged, knickknacks on a&#10;grand scale, for every nation found some remembrance of&#10;home.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Here stood the royal palace of Egypt, there the&#10;caravanserai of the desert land. The Bedouin had quitted his sunny&#10;country, and hastened by on his camel. Here stood the Russian&#10;stables, with the fiery glorious horses of the steppe. Here stood&#10;the simple straw-thatched dwelling of the Danish peasant, with the&#10;Dannebrog flag, next to Gustavus Vasa&#39;s wooden house from Dalarne,&#10;with its wonderful carvings. American huts, English cottages,&#10;French pavilions, kiosks, theatres, churches, all strewn around,&#10;and between them the fresh green turf, the clear springing water,&#10;blooming bushes, rare trees, hothouses, in which one might fancy&#10;one&#39;s self transported into the tropical forest; whole gardens&#10;brought from Damascus, and blooming under one roof. What colors,&#10;what fragrance!&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Artificial grottoes surrounded bodies of fresh or salt&#10;water, and gave a glimpse into the empire of the fishes; the&#10;visitor seemed to wander at the bottom of the sea, among fishes and&#10;polypi.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;All this,&#34; they said, &#34;the Champ de Mars offers;&#34; and&#10;around the great richly-spread table the crowd of human beings&#10;moves like a busy swarm of ants, on foot or in little carriages,&#10;for not all feet are equal to such a fatiguing journey.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Hither they swarm from morning till late in the evening.&#10;Steamer after steamer, crowded with people, glides down the Seine.&#10;The number of carriages is continually on the increase. The swarm&#10;of people on foot and on horseback grows more and more dense.&#10;Carriages and omnibuses are crowded, stuffed and embroidered with&#10;people. All these tributary streams flow in one direction&#8212;towards&#10;the Exhibition. On every entrance the flag of France is displayed;&#10;around the world&#39;s bazaar wave the flags of all nations. There is a&#10;humming and a murmuring from the hall of the machines; from the&#10;towers the melody of the chimes is heard; with the tones of the&#10;organs in the churches mingle the hoarse nasal songs from the cafes&#10;of the East. It is a kingdom of Babel, a wonder of the&#10;world!&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In very truth it was. That&#39;s what all the reports said,&#10;and who did not hear them? The Dryad knew everything that is told&#10;here of the new wonder in the city of cities.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Fly away, ye birds! fly away to see, and then come back&#10;and tell me,&#34; said the Dryad.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The wish became an intense desire&#8212;became the one thought&#10;of a life. Then, in the quiet silent night, while the full moon was&#10;shining, the Dryad saw a spark fly out of the moon&#39;s disc, and fall&#10;like a shooting star. And before the tree, whose leaves waved to&#10;and fro as if they were stirred by a tempest, stood a noble,&#10;mighty, and grand figure. In tones that were at once rich and&#10;strong, like the trumpet of the Last Judgment bidding farewell to&#10;life and summoning to the great account, it said:&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Thou shalt go to the city of magic; thou shalt take root&#10;there, and enjoy the mighty rushing breezes, the air and the&#10;sunshine there. But the time of thy life shall then be shortened;&#10;the line of years that awaited thee here amid the free nature shall&#10;shrink to but a small tale. Poor Dryad! It shall be thy&#10;destruction. Thy yearning and longing will increase, thy desire&#10;will grow more stormy, the tree itself will be as a prison to thee,&#10;thou wilt quit thy cell and give up thy nature to fly out and&#10;mingle among men. Then the years that would have belonged to thee&#10;will be contracted to half the span of the ephemeral fly, that&#10;lives but a day: one night, and thy life-taper shall be blown&#10;out&#8212;the leaves of the tree will wither and be blown away, to become&#10;green never again!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Thus the words sounded. And the light vanished away, but&#10;not the longing of the Dryad. She trembled in the wild fever of&#10;expectation.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I shall go there!&#34; she cried, rejoicingly. &#34;Life is&#10;beginning and swells like a cloud; nobody knows whither it is&#10;hastening.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;When the gray dawn arose and the moon turned pale and the&#10;clouds were tinted red, the wished-for hour struck. The words of&#10;promise were fulfilled.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;People appeared with spades and poles; they dug round the&#10;roots of the tree, deeper and deeper, and beneath it. A wagon was&#10;brought out, drawn by many horses, and the tree was lifted up, with&#10;its roots and the lumps of earth that adhered to them; matting was&#10;placed around the roots, as though the tree had its feet in a warm&#10;bag. And now the tree was lifted on the wagon and secured with&#10;chains. The journey began&#8212;the journey to Paris. There the tree was&#10;to grow as an ornament to the city of French glory.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The twigs and the leaves of the chestnut tree trembled in&#10;the first moments of its being moved; and the Dryad trembled in the&#10;pleasurable feeling of expectation.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Away! away!&#34; it sounded in every beat of her pulse.&#10;&#34;Away! away&#34; sounded in words that flew trembling along. The Dryad&#10;forgot to bid farewell to the regions of home; she thought not of&#10;the waving grass and of the innocent daisies, which had looked up&#10;to her as to a great lady, a young Princess playing at being a&#10;shepherdess out in the open air.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The chestnut tree stood upon the wagon, and nodded his&#10;branches; whether this meant &#34;farewell&#34; or &#34;forward,&#34; the Dryad&#10;knew not; she dreamed only of the marvellous new things, that&#10;seemed yet so familiar, and that were to unfold themselves before&#10;her. No child&#39;s heart rejoicing in innocence&#8212;no heart whose blood&#10;danced with passion&#8212;had set out on the journey to Paris more full&#10;of expectation than she.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Her &#34;farewell&#34; sounded in the words &#34;Away!&#10;away!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The wheels turned; the distant approached; the present&#10;vanished. The region was changed, even as the clouds change. New&#10;vineyards, forests, villages, villas appeared&#8212;came&#10;nearer&#8212;vanished!&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The chestnut tree moved forward, and the Dryad went with&#10;it. Steam-engine after steam-engine rushed past, sending up into&#10;the air vapory clouds, that formed figures which told of Paris,&#10;whence they came, and whither the Dryad was going.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Everything around knew it, and must know whither she was&#10;bound. It seemed to her as if every tree she passed stretched out&#10;its leaves towards her, with the prayer&#8212;&#34;Take me with you! take me&#10;with you!&#34; for every tree enclosed a longing Dryad.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;What changes during this flight! Houses seemed to be&#10;rising out of the earth&#8212;more and more&#8212;thicker and thicker. The&#10;chimneys rose like flower-pots ranged side by side, or in rows one&#10;above the other, on the roofs. Great inscriptions in letters a yard&#10;long, and figures in various colors, covering the walls from&#10;cornice to basement, came brightly out.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Where does Paris begin, and when shall I be there?&#34; asked&#10;the Dryad.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The crowd of people grew; the tumult and the bustle&#10;increased; carriage followed upon carriage; people on foot and&#10;people on horseback were mingled together; all around were shops on&#10;shops, music and song, crying and talking.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Dryad, in her tree, was now in the midst of Paris. The&#10;great heavy wagon all at once stopped on a little square planted&#10;with trees. The high houses around had all of them balconies to the&#10;windows, from which the inhabitants looked down upon the young&#10;fresh chestnut tree, which was coming to be planted here as a&#10;substitute for the dead tree that lay stretched on the&#10;ground.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The passers-by stood still and smiled in admiration of its&#10;pure vernal freshness. The older trees, whose buds were still&#10;closed, whispered with their waving branches, &#34;Welcome! welcome!&#34;&#10;The fountain, throwing its jet of water high up in the air, to let&#10;it fall again in the wide stone basin, told the wind to sprinkle&#10;the new-comer with pearly drops, as if it wished to give him a&#10;refreshing draught to welcome him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Dryad felt how her tree was being lifted from the&#10;wagon to be placed in the spot where it was to stand. The roots&#10;were covered with earth, and fresh turf was laid on top. Blooming&#10;shrubs and flowers in pots were ranged around; and thus a little&#10;garden arose in the square.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The tree that had been killed by the fumes of gas, the&#10;steam of kitchens, and the bad air of the city, was put upon the&#10;wagon and driven away. The passers-by looked on. Children and old&#10;men sat upon the bench, and looked at the green tree. And we who&#10;are telling this story stood upon a balcony, and looked down upon&#10;the green spring sight that had been brought in from the fresh&#10;country air, and said, what the old clergyman would have said,&#10;&#34;Poor Dryad!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I am happy! I am happy!&#34; the Dryad cried, rejoicing; &#34;and&#10;yet I cannot realize, cannot describe what I feel. Everything is as&#10;I fancied it, and yet as I did not fancy it.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The houses stood there, so lofty, so close! The sunlight&#10;shone on only one of the walls, and that one was stuck over with&#10;bills and placards, before which the people stood still; and this&#10;made a crowd.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Carriages rushed past, carriages rolled past; light ones&#10;and heavy ones mingled together. Omnibuses, those over-crowded&#10;moving houses, came rattling by; horsemen galloped among them; even&#10;carts and wagons asserted their rights.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Dryad asked herself if these high-grown houses, which&#10;stood so close around her, would not remove and take other shapes,&#10;like the clouds in the sky, and draw aside, so that she might cast&#10;a glance into Paris, and over it. Notre Dame must show itself, the&#10;Vendome Column, and the wondrous building which had called and was&#10;still calling so many strangers to the city.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But the houses did not stir from their places. It was yet&#10;day when the lamps were lit. The gas-jets gleamed from the shops,&#10;and shone even into the branches of the trees, so that it was like&#10;sunlight in summer. The stars above made their appearance, the same&#10;to which the Dryad had looked up in her home. She thought she felt&#10;a clear pure stream of air which went forth from them. She felt&#10;herself lifted up and strengthened, and felt an increased power of&#10;seeing through every leaf and through every fibre of the root. Amid&#10;all the noise and the turmoil, the colors and the lights, she knew&#10;herself watched by mild eyes.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;From the side streets sounded the merry notes of fiddles&#10;and wind instruments. Up! to the dance, to the dance! to jollity&#10;and pleasure! that was their invitation. Such music it was, that&#10;horses, carriages, trees, and houses would have danced, if they had&#10;known how. The charm of intoxicating delight filled the bosom of&#10;the Dryad.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;How glorious, how splendid it is!&#34; she cried,&#10;rejoicingly. &#34;Now I am in Paris!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The next day that dawned, the next night that fell,&#10;offered the same spectacle, similar bustle, similar life; changing,&#10;indeed, yet always the same; and thus it went on through the&#10;sequence of days.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Now I know every tree, every flower on the square here! I&#10;know every house, every balcony, every shop in this narrow cut-off&#10;corner, where I am denied the sight of this great mighty city.&#10;Where are the arches of triumph, the Boulevards, the wondrous&#10;building of the world? I see nothing of all this. As if shut up in&#10;a cage, I stand among the high houses, which I now know by heart,&#10;with their inscriptions, signs, and placards; all the painted&#10;confectionery, that is no longer to my taste. Where are all the&#10;things of which I heard, for which I longed, and for whose sake I&#10;wanted to come hither? what have I seized, found, won? I feel the&#10;same longing I felt before; I feel that there is a life I should&#10;wish to grasp and to experience. I must go out into the ranks of&#10;living men, and mingle among them. I must fly about like a bird. I&#10;must see and feel, and become human altogether. I must enjoy the&#10;one half-day, instead of vegetating for years in every-day sameness&#10;and weariness, in which I become ill, and at last sink and&#10;disappear like the dew on the meadows. I will gleam like the cloud,&#10;gleam in the sunshine of life, look out over the whole like the&#10;cloud, and pass away like it, no one knoweth whither.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Thus sighed the Dryad; and she prayed:&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Take from me the years that were destined for me, and&#10;give me but half of the life of the ephemeral fly! Deliver me from&#10;my prison! Give me human life, human happiness, only a short span,&#10;only the one night, if it cannot be otherwise; and then punish me&#10;for my wish to live, my longing for life! Strike me out of thy&#10;list. Let my shell, the fresh young tree, wither, or be hewn down,&#10;and burnt to ashes, and scattered to all the winds!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A rustling went through the leaves of the tree; there was&#10;a trembling in each of the leaves; it seemed as if fire streamed&#10;through it. A gust of wind shook its green crown, and from the&#10;midst of that crown a female figure came forth. In the same moment&#10;she was sitting beneath the brightly-illuminated leafy branches,&#10;young and beautiful to behold, like poor Mary, to whom the&#10;clergyman had said, &#34;The great city will be thy&#10;destruction.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Dryad sat at the foot of the tree&#8212;at her house door,&#10;which she had locked, and whose key had thrown away. So young! so&#10;fair! The stars saw her, and blinked at her. The gas-lamps saw her,&#10;and gleamed and beckoned to her. How delicate she was, and yet how&#10;blooming!&#8212;a child, and yet a grown maiden! Her dress was fine as&#10;silk, green as the freshly-opened leaves on the crown of the tree;&#10;in her nut-brown hair clung a half-opened chestnut blossom. She&#10;looked like the Goddess of Spring.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;For one short minute she sat motionless; then she sprang&#10;up, and, light as a gazelle, she hurried away. She ran and sprang&#10;like the reflection from the mirror that, carried by the sunshine,&#10;is cast, now here, now there. Could any one have followed her with&#10;his eyes, he would have seen how marvellously her dress and her&#10;form changed, according to the nature of the house or the place&#10;whose light happened to shine upon her.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;She reached the Boulevards. Here a sea of light streamed&#10;forth from the gas-flames of the lamps, the shops and the cafes.&#10;Here stood in a row young and slender trees, each of which&#10;concealed its Dryad, and gave shade from the artificial sunlight.&#10;The whole vast pavement was one great festive hall, where covered&#10;tables stood laden with refreshments of all kinds, from champagne&#10;and Chartreuse down to coffee and beer. Here was an exhibition of&#10;flowers, statues, books, and colored stuffs.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;From the crowd close by the lofty houses she looked forth&#10;over the terrific stream beyond the rows of trees. Yonder heaved a&#10;stream of rolling carriages, cabriolets, coaches, omnibuses, cabs,&#10;and among them riding gentlemen and marching troops. To cross to&#10;the opposite shore was an undertaking fraught with danger to life&#10;and limb. Now lanterns shed their radiance abroad; now the gas had&#10;the upper hand; suddenly a rocket rises! Whence?&#10;Whither?&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Here are sounds of soft Italian melodies; yonder, Spanish&#10;songs are sung, accompanied by the rattle of the castanets; but&#10;strongest of all, and predominating over the rest, the street-organ&#10;tunes of the moment, the exciting &#34;Can-Can&#34; music, which Orpheus&#10;never knew, and which was never heard by the &#34;Belle Helene.&#34; Even&#10;the barrow was tempted to hop upon one of its wheels.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Dryad danced, floated, flew, changing her color every&#10;moment, like a humming-bird in the sunshine; each house, with the&#10;world belonging to it, gave her its own reflections.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;As the glowing lotus-flower, torn from its stem, is&#10;carried away by the stream, so the Dryad drifted along. Whenever&#10;she paused, she was another being, so that none was able to follow&#10;her, to recognize her, or to look more closely at her.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Like cloud-pictures, all things flew by her. She looked&#10;into a thousand faces, but not one was familiar to her; she saw not&#10;a single form from home. Two bright eyes had remained in her&#10;memory. She thought of Mary, poor Mary, the ragged merry child, who&#10;wore the red flowers in her black hair. Mary was now here, in the&#10;world-city, rich and magnificent as in that day when she drove past&#10;the house of the old clergyman, and past the tree of the Dryad, the&#10;old oak.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Here she was certainly living, in the deafening tumult.&#10;Perhaps she had just stepped out of one of the gorgeous carriages&#10;in waiting. Handsome equipages, with coachmen in gold braid and&#10;footmen in silken hose, drove up. The people who alighted from them&#10;were all richly-dressed ladies. They went through the opened gate,&#10;and ascended the broad staircase that led to a building resting on&#10;marble pillars. Was this building, perhaps, the wonder of the&#10;world? There Mary would certainly be found.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Sancta Maria!&#34; resounded from the interior. Incense&#10;floated through the lofty painted and gilded aisles, where a solemn&#10;twilight reigned.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was the Church of the Madeleine.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Clad in black garments of the most costly stuffs,&#10;fashioned according to the latest mode, the rich feminine world of&#10;Paris glided across the shining pavement. The crests of the&#10;proprietors were engraved on silver shields on the velvet-bound&#10;prayer-books, and embroidered in the corners of perfumed&#10;handkerchiefs bordered with Brussels lace. A few of the ladies were&#10;kneeling in silent prayer before the altars; others resorted to the&#10;confessionals.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Anxiety and fear took possession of the Dryad; she felt as&#10;if she had entered a place where she had no right to be. Here was&#10;the abode of silence, the hall of secrets. Everything was said in&#10;whispers, every word was a mystery.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Dryad saw herself enveloped in lace and silk, like the&#10;women of wealth and of high birth around her. Had, perhaps, every&#10;one of them a longing in her breast, like the Dryad?&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A deep, painful sigh was heard. Did it escape from some&#10;confessional in a distant corner, or from the bosom of the Dryad?&#10;She drew the veil closer around her; she breathed incense, and not&#10;the fresh air. Here was not the abiding-place of her&#10;longing.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Away! away&#8212;a hastening without rest. The ephemeral fly&#10;knows not repose, for her existence is flight.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;She was out again among the gas candelabra, by a&#10;magnificent fountain.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;All its streaming waters are not able to wash out the&#10;innocent blood that was spilt here.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Such were the words spoken. Strangers stood around,&#10;carrying on a lively conversation, such as no one would have dared&#10;to carry on in the gorgeous hall of secrets whence the Dryad&#10;came.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A heavy stone slab was turned and then lifted. She did not&#10;understand why. She saw an opening that led into the depths below.&#10;The strangers stepped down, leaving the starlit air and the&#10;cheerful life of the upper world behind them.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I am afraid,&#34; said one of the women who stood around, to&#10;her husband, &#34;I cannot venture to go down, nor do I care for the&#10;wonders down yonder. You had better stay here with me.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Indeed, and travel home,&#34; said the man, &#34;and quit Paris&#10;without having seen the most wonderful thing of all&#8212;the real wonder&#10;of the present period, created by the power and resolution of one&#10;man!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I will not go down for all that,&#34; was the&#10;reply.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The wonder of the present time,&#34; it had been called. The&#10;Dryad had heard and had understood it. The goal of her ardent&#10;longing had thus been reached, and here was the entrance to it.&#10;Down into the depths below Paris? She had not thought of such a&#10;thing; but now she heard it said, and saw the strangers descending,&#10;and went after them.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The staircase was of cast iron, spiral, broad and easy.&#10;Below there burned a lamp, and farther down, another. They stood in&#10;a labyrinth of endless halls and arched passages, all communicating&#10;with each other. All the streets and lanes of Paris were to be seen&#10;here again, as in a dim reflection. The names were painted up; and&#10;every, house above had its number down here also, and struck its&#10;roots under the macadamized quays of a broad canal, in which the&#10;muddy water flowed onward. Over it the fresh streaming water was&#10;carried on arches; and quite at the top hung the tangled net of&#10;gas-pipes and telegraph-wires.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the distance lamps gleamed, like a reflection from the&#10;world-city above. Every now and then a dull rumbling was heard.&#10;This came from the heavy wagons rolling over the entrance&#10;bridges.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Whither had the Dryad come?&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;You have, no doubt, heard of the CATACOMBS? Now they are&#10;vanishing points in that new underground world&#8212;that wonder of the&#10;present day&#8212;the sewers of Paris. The Dryad was there, and not in&#10;the world&#39;s Exhibition in the Champ de Mars.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;She heard exclamations of wonder and&#10;admiration.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;From here go forth health and life for thousands upon&#10;thousands up yonder! Our time is the time of progress, with its&#10;manifold blessings.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Such was the opinion and the speech of men; but not of&#10;those creatures who had been born here, and who built and dwelt&#10;here&#8212;of the rats, namely, who were squeaking to one another in the&#10;clefts of a crumbling wall, quite plainly, and in a way the Dryad&#10;understood well.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A big old Father-Rat, with his tail bitten off, was&#10;relieving his feelings in loud squeaks; and his family gave their&#10;tribute of concurrence to every word he said:&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I am disgusted with this man-mewing,&#34; he cried&#8212;&#34;with&#10;these outbursts of ignorance. A fine magnificence, truly! all made&#10;up of gas and petroleum! I can&#39;t eat such stuff as that. Everything&#10;here is so fine and bright now, that one&#39;s ashamed of one&#39;s self,&#10;without exactly knowing why. Ah, if we only lived in the days of&#10;tallow candles! and it does not lie so very far behind us. That was&#10;a romantic time, as one may say.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What are you talking of there?&#34; asked the Dryad. &#34;I have&#10;never seen you before. What is it you are talking&#10;about?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Of the glorious days that are gone,&#34; said the Rat&#8212;&#34;of the&#10;happy time of our great-grandfathers and great-grandmothers. Then&#10;it was a great thing to get down here. That was a rat&#39;s nest quite&#10;different from Paris. Mother Plague used to live here then; she&#10;killed people, but never rats. Robbers and smugglers could breathe&#10;freely here. Here was the meeting-place of the most interesting&#10;personages, whom one now only gets to see in the theatres where&#10;they act melodrama, up above. The time of romance is gone even in&#10;our rat&#39;s nest; and here also fresh air and petroleum have broken&#10;in.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Thus squeaked the Rat; he squeaked in honor of the old&#10;time, when Mother Plague was still alive.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A carriage stopped, a kind of open omnibus, drawn by swift&#10;horses. The company mounted and drove away along the Boulevard de&#10;Sebastopol, that is to say, the underground boulevard, over which&#10;the well-known crowded street of that name extended.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The carriage disappeared in the twilight; the Dryad&#10;disappeared, lifted to the cheerful freshness above. Here, and not&#10;below in the vaulted passages, filled with heavy air, the wonder&#10;work must be found which she was to seek in her short lifetime. It&#10;must gleam brighter than all the gas-flames, stronger than the moon&#10;that was just gliding past.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Yes, certainly, she saw it yonder in the distance, it&#10;gleamed before her, and twinkled and glittered like the evening&#10;star in the sky.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;She saw a glittering portal open, that led to a little&#10;garden, where all was brightness and dance music. Colored lamps&#10;surrounded little lakes, in which were water-plants of colored&#10;metal, from whose flowers jets of water spurted up. Beautiful&#10;weeping willows, real products of spring, hung their fresh branches&#10;over these lakes like a fresh, green, transparent, and yet&#10;screening veil. In the bushes burnt an open fire, throwing a red&#10;twilight over the quiet huts of branches, into which the sounds of&#10;music penetrated&#8212;an ear tickling, intoxicating music, that sent the&#10;blood coursing through the veins.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Beautiful girls in festive attire, with pleasant smiles on&#10;their lips, and the light spirit of youth in their hearts&#8212;&#34;Marys,&#34;&#10;with roses in their hair, but without carriage and&#10;postilion&#8212;flitted to and fro in the wild dance.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Where were the heads, where the feet? As if stung by&#10;tarantulas, they sprang, laughed, rejoiced, as if in their&#10;ecstacies they were going to embrace all the world.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Dryad felt herself torn with them into the whirl of&#10;the dance. Round her delicate foot clung the silken boot, chestnut&#10;brown in color, like the ribbon that floated from her hair down&#10;upon her bare shoulders. The green silk dress waved in large folds,&#10;but did not entirely hide the pretty foot and ankle.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Had she come to the enchanted Garden of Armida? What was&#10;the name of the place?&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The name glittered in gas-jets over the entrance. It was&#10;&#34;Mabille.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The soaring upwards of rockets, the splashing of&#10;fountains, and the popping of champagne corks accompanied the wild&#10;bacchantic dance. Over the whole glided the moon through the air,&#10;clear, but with a somewhat crooked face.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A wild joviality seemed to rush through the Dryad, as&#10;though she were intoxicated with opium. Her eyes spoke, her lips&#10;spoke, but the sound of violins and of flutes drowned the sound of&#10;her voice. Her partner whispered words to her which she did not&#10;understand, nor do we understand them. He stretched out his arms to&#10;draw her to him, but he embraced only the empty air.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Dryad had been carried away, like a rose-leaf on the&#10;wind. Before her she saw a flame in the air, a flashing light high&#10;up on a tower. The beacon light shone from the goal of her longing,&#10;shone from the red lighthouse tower of the Fata Morgana of the&#10;Champ de Mars. Thither she was carried by the wind. She circled&#10;round the tower; the workmen thought it was a butterfly that had&#10;come too early, and that now sank down dying.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The moon shone bright, gas-lamps spread light around,&#10;through the halls, over the all-world&#39;s buildings scattered about,&#10;over the rose-hills and the rocks produced by human ingenuity, from&#10;which waterfalls, driven by the power of &#34;Master Bloodless,&#34; fell&#10;down. The caverns of the sea, the depths of the lakes, the kingdom&#10;of the fishes were opened here. Men walked as in the depths of the&#10;deep pond, and held converse with the sea, in the diving-bell of&#10;glass. The water pressed against the strong glass walls above and&#10;on every side. The polypi, eel-like living creatures, had fastened&#10;themselves to the bottom, and stretched out arms, fathoms long, for&#10;prey. A big turbot was making himself broad in front, quietly&#10;enough, but not without casting some suspicious glances aside. A&#10;crab clambered over him, looking like a gigantic spider, while the&#10;shrimps wandered about in restless haste, like the butterflies and&#10;moths of the sea.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the fresh water grew water-lilies, nymphaea, and reeds;&#10;the gold-fishes stood up below in rank and file, all turning their&#10;heads one way, that the streaming water might flow into their&#10;mouths. Fat carps stared at the glass wall with stupid eyes. They&#10;knew that they were here to be exhibited, and that they had made&#10;the somewhat toilsome journey hither in tubs filled with water; and&#10;they thought with dismay of the land-sickness from which they had&#10;suffered so cruelly on the railway.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;They had come to see the Exhibition, and now contemplated&#10;it from their fresh or salt-water position. They looked attentively&#10;at the crowds of people who passed by them early and late. All the&#10;nations in the world, they thought, had made an exhibition of their&#10;inhabitants, for the edification of the soles and haddocks, pike&#10;and carp, that they might give their opinions upon the different&#10;kinds.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Those are scaly animals&#34; said a little slimy Whiting.&#10;&#34;They put on different scales two or three times a day, and they&#10;emit sounds which they call speaking. We don&#39;t put on scales, and&#10;we make ourselves understood in an easier way, simply by twitching&#10;the corners of our mouths and staring with our eyes. We have a&#10;great many advantages over mankind.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But they have learned swimming of us,&#34; remarked a&#10;well-educated Codling. &#34;You must know I come from the great sea&#10;outside. In the hot time of the year the people yonder go into the&#10;water; first they take off their scales, and then they swim. They&#10;have learnt from the frogs to kick out with their hind legs, and&#10;row with their fore paws. But they cannot hold out long. They want&#10;to be like us, but they cannot come up to us. Poor&#10;people!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the fishes stared. They thought that the whole swarm&#10;of people whom they had seen in the bright daylight were still&#10;moving around them; they were certain they still saw the same forms&#10;that had first caught their attention.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A pretty Barbel, with spotted skin, and an enviably round&#10;back, declared that the &#34;human fry&#34; were still there.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I can see a well set-up human figure quite well,&#34; said&#10;the Barbel. &#34;She was called &#39;contumacious lady,&#39; or something of&#10;that kind. She had a mouth and staring eyes, like ours, and a great&#10;balloon at the back of her head, and something like a shut-up&#10;umbrella in front; there were a lot of dangling bits of seaweed&#10;hanging about her. She ought to take all the rubbish off, and go as&#10;we do; then she would look something like a respectable barbel, so&#10;far as it is possible for a person to look like one!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What&#39;s become of that one whom they drew away with the&#10;hook? He sat on a wheel-chair, and had paper, and pen, and ink, and&#10;wrote down everything. They called him a &#39;writer.&#39;&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;They&#39;re going about with him still,&#34; said a hoary old&#10;maid of a Carp, who carried her misfortune about with her, so that&#10;she was quite hoarse. In her youth she had once swallowed a hook,&#10;and still swam patiently about with it in her gullet. &#34;A writer?&#10;That means, as we fishes describe it, a kind of cuttle or ink-fish&#10;among men.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Thus the fishes gossipped in their own way; but in the&#10;artificial water-grotto the laborers were busy; who were obliged to&#10;take advantage of the hours of night to get their work done by&#10;daybreak. They accompanied with blows of their hammers and with&#10;songs the parting words of the vanishing Dryad.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;So, at any rate, I have seen you, you pretty&#10;gold-fishes,&#34; she said. &#34;Yes, I know you;&#34; and she waved her hand&#10;to them. &#34;I have known about you a long time in my home; the&#10;swallow told me about you. How beautiful you are! how delicate and&#10;shining! I should like to kiss every one of you. You others, also.&#10;I know you all; but you do not know me.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The fishes stared out into the twilight. They did not&#10;understand a word of it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Dryad was there no longer. She had been a long time in&#10;the open air, where the different countries&#8212;the country of black&#10;bread, the codfish coast, the kingdom of Russia leather, and the&#10;banks of eau-de-Cologne, and the gardens of rose oil&#8212;exhaled their&#10;perfumes from the world-wonder flower.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;When, after a night at a ball, we drive home half asleep&#10;and half awake, the melodies still sound plainly in our ears; we&#10;hear them, and could sing them all from memory. When the eye of the&#10;murdered man closes, the picture of what it saw last clings to it&#10;for a time like a photographic picture.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;So it was likewise here. The bustling life of day had not&#10;yet disappeared in the quiet night. The Dryad had seen it; she&#10;knew, thus it will be repeated tomorrow.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Dryad stood among the fragrant roses, and thought she&#10;knew them, and had seen them in her own home. She also saw red&#10;pomegranate flowers, like those that little Mary had worn in her&#10;dark hair.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Remembrances from the home of her childhood flashed&#10;through her thoughts; her eyes eagerly drank in the prospect&#10;around, and feverish restlessness chased her through the&#10;wonder-filled halls.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A weariness that increased continually, took possession of&#10;her. She felt a longing to rest on the soft Oriental carpets&#10;within, or to lean against the weeping willow without by the clear&#10;water. But for the ephemeral fly there was no rest. In a few&#10;moments the day had completed its circle.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Her thoughts trembled, her limbs trembled, she sank down&#10;on the grass by the bubbling water.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Thou wilt ever spring living from the earth,&#34; she said&#10;mournfully. &#34;Moisten my tongue&#8212;bring me a refreshing&#10;draught.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I am no living water,&#34; was the answer. &#34;I only spring&#10;upward when the machine wills it.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Give me something of thy freshness, thou green grass,&#34;&#10;implored the Dryad; &#34;give me one of thy fragrant&#10;flowers.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;We must die if we are torn from our stalks,&#34; replied the&#10;Flowers and the Grass.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Give me a kiss, thou fresh stream of air&#8212;only a single&#10;life-kiss.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Soon the sun will kiss the clouds red,&#34; answered the&#10;Wind; &#34;then thou wilt be among the dead&#8212;blown away, as all the&#10;splendor here will be blown away before the year shall have ended.&#10;Then I can play again with the light loose sand on the place here,&#10;and whirl the dust over the land and through the air. All is&#10;dust!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Dryad felt a terror like a woman who has cut asunder&#10;her pulse-artery in the bath, but is filled again with the love of&#10;life, even while she is bleeding to death. She raised herself,&#10;tottered forward a few steps, and sank down again at the entrance&#10;to a little church. The gate stood open, lights were burning upon&#10;the altar, and the organ sounded.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;What music! Such notes the Dryad had never yet heard; and&#10;yet it seemed to her as if she recognized a number of well-known&#10;voices among them. They came deep from the heart of all creation.&#10;She thought she heard the stories of the old clergyman, of great&#10;deeds, and of the celebrated names, and of the gifts that the&#10;creatures of God must bestow upon posterity, if they would live on&#10;in the world.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The tones of the organ swelled, and in their song there&#10;sounded these words:&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Thy wishing and thy longing have torn thee, with thy&#10;roots, from the place which God appointed for thee. That was thy&#10;destruction, thou poor Dryad!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The notes became soft and gentle, and seemed to die away&#10;in a wail.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the sky the clouds showed themselves with a ruddy&#10;gleam. The Wind sighed:&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Pass away, ye dead! now the sun is going to&#10;rise!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The first ray fell on the Dryad. Her form was irradiated&#10;in changing colors, like the soap-bubble when it is bursting and&#10;becomes a drop of water; like a tear that falls and passes away&#10;like a vapor.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Poor Dryad! Only a dew-drop, only a tear, poured upon the&#10;earth, and vanished away! &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;Jack the Dullard: An Old Story Told Anew'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;FAR in the interior of the country lay an old baronial&#10;hall, and in it lived an old proprietor, who had two sons, which&#10;two young men thought themselves too clever by half. They wanted to&#10;go out and woo the King&#39;s daughter; for the maiden in question had&#10;publicly announced that she would choose for her husband that youth&#10;who could arrange his words best.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;So these two geniuses prepared themselves a full week for&#10;the wooing&#8212;this was the longest time that could be granted them;&#10;but it was enough, for they had had much preparatory information,&#10;and everybody knows how useful that is. One of them knew the whole&#10;Latin dictionary by heart, and three whole years of the daily paper&#10;of the little town into the bargain, and so well, indeed, that he&#10;could repeat it all either backwards or forwards, just as he chose.&#10;The other was deeply read in the corporation laws, and knew by&#10;heart what every corporation ought to know; and accordingly he&#10;thought he could talk of affairs of state, and put his spoke in the&#10;wheel in the council. And he knew one thing more: he could&#10;embroider suspenders with roses and other flowers, and with&#10;arabesques, for he was a tasty, light-fingered fellow.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I shall win the Princess!&#34; So cried both of them.&#10;Therefore their old papa gave to each of them a handsome horse. The&#10;youth who knew the dictionary and newspaper by heart had a black&#10;horse, and he who knew all about the corporation laws received a&#10;milk-white steed. Then they rubbed the corners of their mouths with&#10;fish-oil, so that they might become very smooth and glib. All the&#10;servants stood below in the courtyard, and looked on while they&#10;mounted their horses; and just by chance the third son came up. For&#10;the proprietor had really three sons, though nobody counted the&#10;third with his brothers, because he was not so learned as they, and&#10;indeed he was generally known as &#34;Jack the Dullard.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Hallo!&#34; said Jack the Dullard, &#34;where are you going? I&#10;declare you have put on your Sunday clothes!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;We&#39;re going to the King&#39;s court, as suitors to the King&#39;s&#10;daughter. Don&#39;t you know the announcement that has been made all&#10;through the country?&#34; And they told him all about it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;My word! I&#39;ll be in it too!&#34; cried Jack the Dullard; and&#10;his two brothers burst out laughing at him, and rode&#10;away.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Father, dear,&#34; said Jack, &#34;I must have a horse too. I do&#10;feel so desperately inclined to marry! If she accepts me, she&#10;accepts me; and if she won&#39;t have me, I&#39;ll have her; but she shall&#10;be mine!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Don&#39;t talk nonsense,&#34; replied the old gentleman. &#34;You&#10;shall have no horse from me. You don&#39;t know how to speak&#8212;you can&#39;t&#10;arrange your words. Your brothers are very different fellows from&#10;you.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Well,&#34; quoth Jack the Dullard, &#34;If I can&#39;t have a horse,&#10;I&#39;ll take the Billy-goat, who belongs to me, and he can carry me&#10;very well!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And so said, so done. He mounted the Billy-goat, pressed&#10;his heels into its sides, and galloped down the high street like a&#10;hurricane.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Hei, houp! that was a ride! Here I come!&#34; shouted Jack&#10;the Dullard, and he sang till his voice echoed far and&#10;wide.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But his brothers rode slowly on in advance of him. They&#10;spoke not a word, for they were thinking about the fine extempore&#10;speeches they would have to bring out, and these had to be cleverly&#10;prepared beforehand.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Hallo!&#34; shouted Jack the Dullard. &#34;Here am I! Look what I&#10;have found on the high road.&#34; And he showed them what it was, and&#10;it was a dead crow.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Dullard!&#34; exclaimed the brothers, &#34;what are you going to&#10;do with that?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;With the crow? why, I am going to give it to the&#10;Princess.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, do so,&#34; said they; and they laughed, and rode&#10;on.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Hallo, here I am again! just see what I have found now:&#10;you don&#39;t find that on the high road every day!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the brothers turned round to see what he could have&#10;found now.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Dullard!&#34; they cried, &#34;that is only an old wooden shoe,&#10;and the upper part is missing into the bargain; are you going to&#10;give that also to the Princess?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Most certainly I shall,&#34; replied Jack the Dullard; and&#10;again the brothers laughed and rode on, and thus they got far in&#10;advance of him; but&#8212;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Hallo&#8212;hop rara!&#34; and there was Jack the Dullard again.&#10;&#34;It is getting better and better,&#34; he cried. &#34;Hurrah! it is quite&#10;famous.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Why, what have you found this time?&#34; inquired the&#10;brothers.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh,&#34; said Jack the Dullard, &#34;I can hardly tell you. How&#10;glad the Princess will be!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Bah!&#34; said the brothers; &#34;that is nothing but clay out of&#10;the ditch.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, certainly it is,&#34; said Jack the Dullard; &#34;and clay&#10;of the finest sort. See, it is so wet, it runs through one&#39;s&#10;fingers.&#34; And he filled his pocket with the clay.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But his brothers galloped on till the sparks flew, and&#10;consequently they arrived a full hour earlier at the town gate than&#10;could Jack. Now at the gate each suitor was provided with a number,&#10;and all were placed in rows immediately on their arrival, six in&#10;each row, and so closely packed together that they could not move&#10;their arms; and that was a prudent arrangement, for they would&#10;certainly have come to blows, had they been able, merely because&#10;one of them stood before the other.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;All the inhabitants of the country round about stood in&#10;great crowds around the castle, almost under the very windows, to&#10;see the Princess receive the suitors; and as each stepped into the&#10;hall, his power of speech seemed to desert him, like the light of a&#10;candle that is blown out. Then the Princess would say, &#34;He is of no&#10;use! Away with him out of the hall!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;At last the turn came for that brother who knew the&#10;dictionary by heart; but he did not know it now; he had absolutely&#10;forgotten it altogether; and the boards seemed to re-echo with his&#10;footsteps, and the ceiling of the hall was made of looking-glass,&#10;so that he saw himself standing on his head; and at the window&#10;stood three clerks and a head clerk, and every one of them was&#10;writing down every single word that was uttered, so that it might&#10;be printed in the newspapers, and sold for a penny at the street&#10;corners. It was a terrible ordeal, and they had, moreover, made&#10;such a fire in the stove, that the room seemed quite red&#10;hot.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It is dreadfully hot here!&#34; observed the first&#10;brother.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes,&#34; replied the Princess, &#34;my father is going to roast&#10;young pullets today.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Baa!&#34; there he stood like a baa-lamb. He had not been&#10;prepared for a speech of this kind, and had not a word to say,&#10;though he intended to say something witty. &#34;Baa!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;He is of no use!&#34; said the Princess. &#34;Away with&#10;him!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And he was obliged to go accordingly. And now the second&#10;brother came in.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It is terribly warm here!&#34; he observed.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, we&#39;re roasting pullets to-day,&#34; replied the&#10;Princess.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What&#8212;what were you&#8212;were you pleased to ob-&#34; stammered&#10;he&#8212;and all the clerks wrote down, &#34;pleased to ob-&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;He is of no use!&#34; said the Princess. &#34;Away with&#10;him!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Now came the turn of Jack the Dullard. He rode into the&#10;hall on his goat.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Well, it&#39;s most abominably hot here.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, because I&#39;m roasting young pullets,&#34; replied the&#10;Princess.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ah, that&#39;s lucky!&#34; exclaimed Jack the Dullard, &#34;for I&#10;suppose you&#39;ll let me roast my crow at the same time?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;With the greatest pleasure,&#34; said the Princess. &#34;But have&#10;you anything you can roast it in? for I have neither pot nor&#10;pan.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Certainly I have!&#34; said Jack. &#34;Here&#39;s a cooking utensil&#10;with a tin handle.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And he brought out the old wooden shoe, and put the crow&#10;into it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Well, that is a famous dish!&#34; said the Princess. &#34;But&#10;what shall we do for sauce?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, I have that in my pocket,&#34; said Jack; &#34;I have so much&#10;of it that I can afford to throw some away;&#34; and he poured some of&#10;the clay out of his pocket.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I like that!&#34; said the Princess. &#34;You can give an answer,&#10;and you have something to say for yourself, and so you shall be my&#10;husband. But are you aware that every word we speak is being taken&#10;down, and will be published in the paper to-morrow? Look yonder,&#10;and you will see in every window three clerks and a head clerk; and&#10;the old head clerk is the worst of all, for he can&#39;t understand&#10;anything.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But she only said this to frighten Jack the Dullard; and&#10;the clerks gave a great crow of delight, and each one spurted a&#10;blot out of his pen on to the floor.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, those are the gentlemen, are they?&#34; said Jack; &#34;then&#10;I will give the best I have to the head clerk.&#34; And he turned out&#10;his pockets, and flung the wet clay full in the head clerk&#39;s&#10;face.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That was very cleverly done,&#34; observed the Princess. &#34;I&#10;could not have done that; but I shall learn in time.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And accordingly Jack the Dullard was made a king, and&#10;received a crown and a wife, and sat upon a throne. And this report&#10;we have wet from the press of the head clerk and the corporation of&#10;printers&#8212;but they are not to be depended upon in the least.&#10;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)

The sun&#10;was shining and all the windows were open; within the house people&#10;were very busy. In the yard, in an arbour formed by lilac bushes in&#10;full bloom, stood an open coffin; thither they had carried a dead&#10;man, who was to be buried that very afternoon. Nobody shed a tear&#10;over him; his face was covered over with a white cloth, under his&#10;head they had placed a large thick book, the leaves of which&#10;consisted of folded sheets of blotting-paper, and withered flowers&#10;lay between them; it was the herbarium which he had gathered in&#10;various places and was to be buried with him, according to his own&#10;wish. Every one of the flowers in it was connected with some&#10;chapter of his life.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Who is the dead man?&#34; we asked.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The old student,&#34; was the reply. &#34;They say that he was&#10;once an energetic young man, that he studied the dead languages,&#10;and sang and even composed many songs; then something had happened&#10;to him, and in consequence of this he gave himself up to drink,&#10;body and mind. When at last he had ruined his health, they brought&#10;him into the country, where someone paid for his board and&#10;residence. He was gentle as a child as long as the sullen mood did&#10;not come over him; but when it came he was fierce, became as strong&#10;as a giant, and ran about in the wood like a chased deer. But when&#10;we succeeded in bringing him home, and prevailed upon him to open&#10;the book with the dried-up plants in it, he would sometimes sit for&#10;a whole day looking at this or that plant, while frequently the&#10;tears rolled over his cheeks. God knows what was in his mind; but&#10;he requested us to put the book into his coffin, and now he lies&#10;there. In a little while the lid will be placed upon the coffin,&#10;and he will have sweet rest in the grave!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The cloth which covered his face was lifted up; the dead&#10;man&#39;s face expressed peace&#8212;a sunbeam fell upon it. A swallow flew&#10;with the swiftness of an arrow into the arbour, turning in its&#10;flight, and twittered over the dead man&#39;s head.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;What a strange feeling it is&#8212;surely we all know it&#8212;to look&#10;through old letters of our young days; a different life rises up&#10;out of the past, as it were, with all its hopes and sorrows. How&#10;many of the people with whom in those days we used to be on&#10;intimate terms appear to us as if dead, and yet they are still&#10;alive&#8212;only we have not thought of them for such a long time, whom&#10;we imagined we should retain in our memories for ever, and share&#10;every joy and sorrow with them.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The withered oak leaf in the book here recalled the&#10;friend, the schoolfellow, who was to be his friend for life. He&#10;fixed the leaf to the student&#39;s cap in the green wood, when they&#10;vowed eternal friendship. Where does he dwell now? The leaf is&#10;kept, but the friendship does no longer exist. Here is a foreign&#10;hothouse plant, too tender for the gardens of the North. It is&#10;almost as if its leaves still smelt sweet! She gave it to him out&#10;of her own garden&#8212;a nobleman&#39;s daughter.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Here is a water-lily that he had plucked himself, and&#10;watered with salt tears&#8212;a lily of sweet water. And here is a&#10;nettle: what may its leaves tell us? What might he have thought&#10;when he plucked and kept it? Here is a little snowdrop out of the&#10;solitary wood; here is an evergreen from the flower-pot at the&#10;tavern; and here is a simple blade of grass.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The lilac bends its fresh fragrant flowers over the dead&#10;man&#39;s head; the swallow passes again&#8212;&#34;twit, twit;&#34; now the men come&#10;with hammer and nails, the lid is placed over the dead man, while&#10;his head rests on the dumb book&#8212;so long cherished, now closed for&#10;ever! &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)

He was&#10;such a little wee thing, that no human eye could see him. Behind&#10;each leaf of the rose he had a sleeping chamber. He was as well&#10;formed and as beautiful as a little child could be, and had wings&#10;that reached from his shoulders to his feet. Oh, what sweet&#10;fragrance there was in his chambers! and how clean and beautiful&#10;were the walls! for they were the blushing leaves of the&#10;rose.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;During the whole day he enjoyed himself in the warm&#10;sunshine, flew from flower to flower, and danced on the wings of&#10;the flying butterflies. Then he took it into his head to measure&#10;how many steps he would have to go through the roads and&#10;cross-roads that are on the leaf of a linden-tree. What we call the&#10;veins on a leaf, he took for roads; ay, and very long roads they&#10;were for him; for before he had half finished his task, the sun&#10;went down: he had commenced his work too late. It became very cold,&#10;the dew fell, and the wind blew; so he thought the best thing he&#10;could do would be to return home. He hurried himself as much as he&#10;could; but he found the roses all closed up, and he could not get&#10;in; not a single rose stood open. The poor little elf was very much&#10;frightened. He had never before been out at night, but had always&#10;slumbered secretly behind the warm rose-leaves. Oh, this would&#10;certainly be his death. At the other end of the garden, he knew&#10;there was an arbor, overgrown with beautiful honey-suckles. The&#10;blossoms looked like large painted horns; and he thought to&#10;himself, he would go and sleep in one of these till the morning. He&#10;flew thither; but &#34;hush!&#34; two people were in the arbor,&#8212;a handsome&#10;young man and a beautiful lady. They sat side by side, and wished&#10;that they might never be obliged to part. They loved each other&#10;much more than the best child can love its father and&#10;mother.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But we must part,&#34; said the young man; &#34;your brother does&#10;not like our engagement, and therefore he sends me so far away on&#10;business, over mountains and seas. Farewell, my sweet bride; for so&#10;you are to me.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And then they kissed each other, and the girl wept, and&#10;gave him a rose; but before she did so, she pressed a kiss upon it&#10;so fervently that the flower opened. Then the little elf flew in,&#10;and leaned his head on the delicate, fragrant walls. Here he could&#10;plainly hear them say, &#34;Farewell, farewell;&#34; and he felt that the&#10;rose had been placed on the young man&#39;s breast. Oh, how his heart&#10;did beat! The little elf could not go to sleep, it thumped so&#10;loudly. The young man took it out as he walked through the dark&#10;wood alone, and kissed the flower so often and so violently, that&#10;the little elf was almost crushed. He could feel through the leaf&#10;how hot the lips of the young man were, and the rose had opened, as&#10;if from the heat of the noonday sun.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;There came another man, who looked gloomy and wicked. He&#10;was the wicked brother of the beautiful maiden. He drew out a sharp&#10;knife, and while the other was kissing the rose, the wicked man&#10;stabbed him to death; then he cut off his head, and buried it with&#10;the body in the soft earth under the linden-tree.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Now he is gone, and will soon be forgotten,&#34; thought the&#10;wicked brother; &#34;he will never come back again. He was going on a&#10;long journey over mountains and seas; it is easy for a man to lose&#10;his life in such a journey. My sister will suppose he is dead; for&#10;he cannot come back, and she will not dare to question me about&#10;him.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then he scattered the dry leaves over the light earth with&#10;his foot, and went home through the darkness; but he went not&#10;alone, as he thought,&#8212;the little elf accompanied him. He sat in a&#10;dry rolled-up linden-leaf, which had fallen from the tree on to the&#10;wicked man&#39;s head, as he was digging the grave. The hat was on the&#10;head now, which made it very dark, and the little elf shuddered&#10;with fright and indignation at the wicked deed.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was the dawn of morning before the wicked man reached&#10;home; he took off his hat, and went into his sister&#39;s room. There&#10;lay the beautiful, blooming girl, dreaming of him whom she loved&#10;so, and who was now, she supposed, travelling far away over&#10;mountain and sea. Her wicked brother stopped over her, and laughed&#10;hideously, as fiends only can laugh. The dry leaf fell out of his&#10;hair upon the counterpane; but he did not notice it, and went to&#10;get a little sleep during the early morning hours. But the elf&#10;slipped out of the withered leaf, placed himself by the ear of the&#10;sleeping girl, and told her, as in a dream, of the horrid murder;&#10;described the place where her brother had slain her lover, and&#10;buried his body; and told her of the linden-tree, in full blossom,&#10;that stood close by.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That you may not think this is only a dream that I have&#10;told you,&#34; he said, &#34;you will find on your bed a withered&#10;leaf.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then she awoke, and found it there. Oh, what bitter tears&#10;she shed! and she could not open her heart to any one for&#10;relief.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The window stood open the whole day, and the little elf&#10;could easily have reached the roses, or any of the flowers; but he&#10;could not find it in his heart to leave one so afflicted. In the&#10;window stood a bush bearing monthly roses. He seated himself in one&#10;of the flowers, and gazed on the poor girl. Her brother often came&#10;into the room, and would be quite cheerful, in spite of his base&#10;conduct; so she dare not say a word to him of her heart&#39;s&#10;grief.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;As soon as night came on, she slipped out of the house,&#10;and went into the wood, to the spot where the linden-tree stood;&#10;and after removing the leaves from the earth, she turned it up, and&#10;there found him who had been murdered. Oh, how she wept and prayed&#10;that she also might die! Gladly would she have taken the body home&#10;with her; but that was impossible; so she took up the poor head&#10;with the closed eyes, kissed the cold lips, and shook the mould out&#10;of the beautiful hair.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I will keep this,&#34; said she; and as soon as she had&#10;covered the body again with the earth and leaves, she took the head&#10;and a little sprig of jasmine that bloomed in the wood, near the&#10;spot where he was buried, and carried them home with her. As soon&#10;as she was in her room, she took the largest flower-pot she could&#10;find, and in this she placed the head of the dead man, covered it&#10;up with earth, and planted the twig of jasmine in it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Farewell, farewell,&#34; whispered the little elf. He could&#10;not any longer endure to witness all this agony of grief, he&#10;therefore flew away to his own rose in the garden. But the rose was&#10;faded; only a few dry leaves still clung to the green hedge behind&#10;it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Alas! how soon all that is good and beautiful passes&#10;away,&#34; sighed the elf.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;After a while he found another rose, which became his&#10;home, for among its delicate fragrant leaves he could dwell in&#10;safety. Every morning he flew to the window of the poor girl, and&#10;always found her weeping by the flower pot. The bitter tears fell&#10;upon the jasmine twig, and each day, as she became paler and paler,&#10;the sprig appeared to grow greener and fresher. One shoot after&#10;another sprouted forth, and little white buds blossomed, which the&#10;poor girl fondly kissed. But her wicked brother scolded her, and&#10;asked her if she was going mad. He could not imagine why she was&#10;weeping over that flower-pot, and it annoyed him. He did not know&#10;whose closed eyes were there, nor what red lips were fading beneath&#10;the earth. And one day she sat and leaned her head against the&#10;flower-pot, and the little elf of the rose found her asleep. Then&#10;he seated himself by her ear, talked to her of that evening in the&#10;arbor, of the sweet perfume of the rose, and the loves of the&#10;elves. Sweetly she dreamed, and while she dreamt, her life passed&#10;away calmly and gently, and her spirit was with him whom she loved,&#10;in heaven. And the jasmine opened its large white bells, and spread&#10;forth its sweet fragrance; it had no other way of showing its grief&#10;for the dead. But the wicked brother considered the beautiful&#10;blooming plant as his own property, left to him by his sister, and&#10;he placed it in his sleeping room, close by his bed, for it was&#10;very lovely in appearance, and the fragrance sweet and delightful.&#10;The little elf of the rose followed it, and flew from flower to&#10;flower, telling each little spirit that dwelt in them the story of&#10;the murdered young man, whose head now formed part of the earth&#10;beneath them, and of the wicked brother and the poor sister. &#34;We&#10;know it,&#34; said each little spirit in the flowers, &#34;we know it, for&#10;have we not sprung from the eyes and lips of the murdered one. We&#10;know it, we know it,&#34; and the flowers nodded with their heads in a&#10;peculiar manner. The elf of the rose could not understand how they&#10;could rest so quietly in the matter, so he flew to the bees, who&#10;were gathering honey, and told them of the wicked brother. And the&#10;bees told it to their queen, who commanded that the next morning&#10;they should go and kill the murderer. But during the night, the&#10;first after the sister&#39;s death, while the brother was sleeping in&#10;his bed, close to where he had placed the fragrant jasmine, every&#10;flower cup opened, and invisibly the little spirits stole out,&#10;armed with poisonous spears. They placed themselves by the ear of&#10;the sleeper, told him dreadful dreams and then flew across his&#10;lips, and pricked his tongue with their poisoned spears. &#34;Now have&#10;we revenged the dead,&#34; said they, and flew back into the white&#10;bells of the jasmine flowers. When the morning came, and as soon as&#10;the window was opened, the rose elf, with the queen bee, and the&#10;whole swarm of bees, rushed in to kill him. But he was already&#10;dead. People were standing round the bed, and saying that the scent&#10;of the jasmine had killed him. Then the elf of the rose understood&#10;the revenge of the flowers, and explained it to the queen bee, and&#10;she, with the whole swarm, buzzed about the flower-pot. The bees&#10;could not be driven away. Then a man took it up to remove it, and&#10;one of the bees stung him in the hand, so that he let the&#10;flower-pot fall, and it was broken to pieces. Then every one saw&#10;the whitened skull, and they knew the dead man in the bed was a&#10;murderer. And the queen bee hummed in the air, and sang of the&#10;revenge of the flowers, and of the elf of the rose and said that&#10;behind the smallest leaf dwells One, who can discover evil deeds,&#10;and punish them also. &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Elfin Hill'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A FEW large lizards were running nimbly about in the&#10;clefts of an old tree; they could understand one another very well,&#10;for they spoke the lizard language.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What a buzzing and a rumbling there is in the elfin&#10;hill,&#34; said one of the lizards; &#34;I have not been able to close my&#10;eyes for two nights on account of the noise; I might just as well&#10;have had the toothache, for that always keeps me awake.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;There is something going on within there,&#34; said the other&#10;lizard; &#34;they propped up the top of the hill with four red posts,&#10;till cock-crow this morning, so that it is thoroughly aired, and&#10;the elfin girls have learnt new dances; there is&#10;something.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I spoke about it to an earth-worm of my acquaintance,&#34;&#10;said a third lizard; &#34;the earth-worm had just come from the elfin&#10;hill, where he has been groping about in the earth day and night.&#10;He has heard a great deal; although he cannot see, poor miserable&#10;creature, yet he understands very well how to wriggle and lurk&#10;about. They expect friends in the elfin hill, grand company, too;&#10;but who they are the earth-worm would not say, or, perhaps, he&#10;really did not know. All the will-o&#39;-the-wisps are ordered to be&#10;there to hold a torch dance, as it is called. The silver and gold&#10;which is plentiful in the hill will be polished and placed out in&#10;the moonlight.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Who can the strangers be?&#34; asked the lizards; &#34;what can&#10;the matter be? Hark, what a buzzing and humming there&#10;is!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Just at this moment the elfin hill opened, and an old&#10;elfin maiden, hollow behind, came tripping out; she was the old elf&#10;king&#39;s housekeeper, and a distant relative of the family; therefore&#10;she wore an amber heart on the middle of her forehead. Her feet&#10;moved very fast, &#34;trip, trip;&#34; good gracious, how she could trip&#10;right down to the sea to the night-raven.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You are invited to the elf hill for this evening,&#34; said&#10;she; &#34;but will you do me a great favor and undertake the&#10;invitations? you ought to do something, for you have no&#10;housekeeping to attend to as I have. We are going to have some very&#10;grand people, conjurors, who have always something to say; and&#10;therefore the old elf king wishes to make a great&#10;display.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Who is to be invited?&#34; asked the raven.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;All the world may come to the great ball, even human&#10;beings, if they can only talk in their sleep, or do something after&#10;our fashion. But for the feast the company must be carefully&#10;selected; we can only admit persons of high rank; I have had a&#10;dispute myself with the elf king, as he thought we could not admit&#10;ghosts. The merman and his daughter must be invited first, although&#10;it may not be agreeable to them to remain so long on dry land, but&#10;they shall have a wet stone to sit on, or perhaps something better;&#10;so I think they will not refuse this time. We must have all the old&#10;demons of the first class, with tails, and the hobgoblins and imps;&#10;and then I think we ought not to leave out the death-horse, or the&#10;grave-pig, or even the church dwarf, although they do belong to the&#10;clergy, and are not reckoned among our people; but that is merely&#10;their office, they are nearly related to us, and visit us very&#10;frequently.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Croak,&#34; said the night-raven as he flew away with the&#10;invitations.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The elfin maidens we&#39;re already dancing on the elf hill,&#10;and they danced in shawls woven from moonshine and mist, which look&#10;very pretty to those who like such things. The large hall within&#10;the elf hill was splendidly decorated; the floor had been washed&#10;with moonshine, and the walls had been rubbed with magic ointment,&#10;so that they glowed like tulip-leaves in the light. In the kitchen&#10;were frogs roasting on the spit, and dishes preparing of snail&#10;skins, with children&#39;s fingers in them, salad of mushroom seed,&#10;hemlock, noses and marrow of mice, beer from the marsh woman&#39;s&#10;brewery, and sparkling salt-petre wine from the grave cellars.&#10;These were all substantial food. Rusty nails and church-window&#10;glass formed the dessert. The old elf king had his gold crown&#10;polished up with powdered slate-pencil; it was like that used by&#10;the first form, and very difficult for an elf king to obtain. In&#10;the bedrooms, curtains were hung up and fastened with the slime of&#10;snails; there was, indeed, a buzzing and humming&#10;everywhere.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Now we must fumigate the place with burnt horse-hair and&#10;pig&#39;s bristles, and then I think I shall have done my part,&#34; said&#10;the elf man-servant.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Father, dear,&#34; said the youngest daughter, &#34;may I now&#10;hear who our high-born visitors are?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Well, I suppose I must tell you now,&#34; he replied; &#34;two of&#10;my daughters must prepare themselves to be married, for the&#10;marriages certainly will take place. The old goblin from Norway,&#10;who lives in the ancient Dovre mountains, and who possesses many&#10;castles built of rock and freestone, besides a gold mine, which is&#10;better than all, so it is thought, is coming with his two sons, who&#10;are both seeking a wife. The old goblin is a true-hearted, honest,&#10;old Norwegian graybeard; cheerful and straightforward. I knew him&#10;formerly, when we used to drink together to our good fellowship: he&#10;came here once to fetch his wife, she is dead now. She was the&#10;daughter of the king of the chalk-hills at Moen. They say he took&#10;his wife from chalk; I shall be delighted to see him again. It is&#10;said that the boys are ill-bred, forward lads, but perhaps that is&#10;not quite correct, and they will become better as they grow older.&#10;Let me see that you know how to teach them good&#10;manners.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And when are they coming?&#34; asked the daughter.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That depends upon wind and weather,&#34; said the elf king;&#10;&#34;they travel economically. They will come when there is the chance&#10;of a ship. I wanted them to come over to Sweden, but the old man&#10;was not inclined to take my advice. He does not go forward with the&#10;times, and that I do not like.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Two will-o&#39;-the-wisps came jumping in, one quicker than&#10;the other, so of course, one arrived first. &#34;They are coming! they&#10;are coming!&#34; he cried.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Give me my crown,&#34; said the elf king, &#34;and let me stand&#10;in the moonshine.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The daughters drew on their shawls and bowed down to the&#10;ground. There stood the old goblin from the Dovre mountains, with&#10;his crown of hardened ice and polished fir-cones. Besides this, he&#10;wore a bear-skin, and great, warm boots, while his sons went with&#10;their throats bare and wore no braces, for they were strong&#10;men.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Is that a hill?&#34; said the youngest of the boys, pointing&#10;to the elf hill, &#34;we should call it a hole in Norway.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Boys,&#34; said the old man, &#34;a hole goes in, and a hill&#10;stands out; have you no eyes in your heads?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Another thing they wondered at was, that they were able&#10;without trouble to understand the language.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Take care,&#34; said the old man, &#34;or people will think you&#10;have not been well brought up.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then they entered the elfin hill, where the select and&#10;grand company were assembled, and so quickly had they appeared that&#10;they seemed to have been blown together. But for each guest the&#10;neatest and pleasantest arrangement had been made. The sea folks&#10;sat at table in great water-tubs, and they said it was just like&#10;being at home. All behaved themselves properly excepting the two&#10;young northern goblins; they put their legs on the table and&#10;thought they were all right.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Feet off the table-cloth!&#34; said the old goblin. They&#10;obeyed, but not immediately. Then they tickled the ladies who&#10;waited at table, with the fir-cones, which they carried in their&#10;pockets. They took off their boots, that they might be more at&#10;ease, and gave them to the ladies to hold. But their father, the&#10;old goblin, was very different; he talked pleasantly about the&#10;stately Norwegian rocks, and told fine tales of the waterfalls&#10;which dashed over them with a clattering noise like thunder or the&#10;sound of an organ, spreading their white foam on every side. He&#10;told of the salmon that leaps in the rushing waters, while the&#10;water-god plays on his golden harp. He spoke of the bright winter&#10;nights, when the sledge bells are ringing, and the boys run with&#10;burning torches across the smooth ice, which is so transparent that&#10;they can see the fishes dart forward beneath their feet. He&#10;described everything so clearly, that those who listened could see&#10;it all; they could see the saw-mills going, the men-servants and&#10;the maidens singing songs, and dancing a rattling dance,&#8212;when all&#10;at once the old goblin gave the old elfin maiden a kiss, such a&#10;tremendous kiss, and yet they were almost strangers to each&#10;other.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the elfin girls had to dance, first in the usual way,&#10;and then with stamping feet, which they performed very well; then&#10;followed the artistic and solo dance. Dear me, how they did throw&#10;their legs about! No one could tell where the dance begun, or where&#10;it ended, nor indeed which were legs and which were arms, for they&#10;were all flying about together, like the shavings in a saw-pit! And&#10;then they spun round so quickly that the death-horse and the&#10;grave-pig became sick and giddy, and were obliged to leave the&#10;table.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Stop!&#34; cried the old goblin,&#34; is that the only&#10;house-keeping they can perform? Can they do anything more than&#10;dance and throw about their legs, and make a whirlwind?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You shall soon see what they can do,&#34; said the elf king.&#10;And then he called his youngest daughter to him. She was slender&#10;and fair as moonlight, and the most graceful of all the sisters.&#10;She took a white chip in her mouth, and vanished instantly; this&#10;was her accomplishment. But the old goblin said he should not like&#10;his wife to have such an accomplishment, and thought his boys would&#10;have the same objection. Another daughter could make a figure like&#10;herself follow her, as if she had a shadow, which none of the&#10;goblin folk ever had. The third was of quite a different sort; she&#10;had learnt in the brew-house of the moor witch how to lard elfin&#10;puddings with glow-worms.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;She will make a good housewife,&#34; said the old goblin, and&#10;then saluted her with his eyes instead of drinking her health; for&#10;he did not drink much.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Now came the fourth daughter, with a large harp to play&#10;upon; and when she struck the first chord, every one lifted up the&#10;left leg (for the goblins are left-legged), and at the second chord&#10;they found they must all do just what she wanted.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That is a dangerous woman,&#34; said the old goblin; and the&#10;two sons walked out of the hill; they had had enough of it. &#34;And&#10;what can the next daughter do?&#34; asked the old goblin.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I have learnt everything that is Norwegian,&#34; said she;&#10;&#34;and I will never marry, unless I can go to Norway.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then her youngest sister whispered to the old goblin,&#10;&#34;That is only because she has heard, in a Norwegian song, that when&#10;the world shall decay, the cliffs of Norway will remain standing&#10;like monuments; and she wants to get there, that she may be safe;&#10;for she is so afraid of sinking.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ho! ho!&#34; said the old goblin, &#34;is that what she means?&#10;Well, what can the seventh and last do?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The sixth comes before the seventh,&#34; said the elf king,&#10;for he could reckon; but the sixth would not come&#10;forward.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I can only tell people the truth,&#34; said she. &#34;No one&#10;cares for me, nor troubles himself about me; and I have enough to&#10;do to sew my grave clothes.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;So the seventh and last came; and what could she do? Why,&#10;she could tell stories, as many as you liked, on any&#10;subject.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Here are my five fingers,&#34; said the old goblin; &#34;now tell&#10;me a story for each of them.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;So she took him by the wrist, and he laughed till he&#10;nearly choked; and when she came to the fourth finger, there was a&#10;gold ring on it, as if it knew there was to be a betrothal. Then&#10;the old goblin said, &#34;Hold fast what you have: this hand is yours;&#10;for I will have you for a wife myself.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the elfin girl said that the stories about the&#10;ring-finger and little Peter Playman had not yet been&#10;told.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;We will hear them in the winter,&#34; said the old goblin,&#10;&#34;and also about the fir and the birch-trees, and the ghost stories,&#10;and of the tingling frost. You shall tell your tales, for no one&#10;over there can do it so well; and we will sit in the stone rooms,&#10;where the pine logs are burning, and drink mead out of the golden&#10;drinking-horn of the old Norwegian kings. The water-god has given&#10;me two; and when we sit there, Nix comes to pay us a visit, and&#10;will sing you all the songs of the mountain shepherdesses. How&#10;merry we shall be! The salmon will be leaping in the waterfalls,&#10;and dashing against the stone walls, but he will not be able to&#10;come in. It is indeed very pleasant to live in old Norway. But&#10;where are the lads?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Where indeed were they? Why, running about the fields, and&#10;blowing out the will-o&#39;-the-wisps, who so good-naturedly came and&#10;brought their torches.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What tricks have you been playing?&#34; said the old goblin.&#10;&#34;I have taken a mother for you, and now you may take one of your&#10;aunts.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But the youngsters said they would rather make a speech&#10;and drink to their good fellowship; they had no wish to marry. Then&#10;they made speeches and drank toasts, and tipped their glasses, to&#10;show that they were empty. Then they took off their coats, and lay&#10;down on the table to sleep; for they made themselves quite at home.&#10;But the old goblin danced about the room with his young bride, and&#10;exchanged boots with her, which is more fashionable than exchanging&#10;rings.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The cock is crowing,&#34; said the old elfin maiden who acted&#10;as housekeeper; now we must close the shutters, that the sun may&#10;not scorch us.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the hill closed up. But the lizards continued to run&#10;up and down the riven tree; and one said to the other, &#34;Oh, how&#10;much I was pleased with the old goblin!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The boys pleased me better,&#34; said the earth-worm. But&#10;then the poor miserable creature could not see.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Emperor&#39;s New Suit'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;MANY, many years ago lived an emperor, who thought so much&#10;of new clothes that he spent all his money in order to obtain them;&#10;his only ambition was to be always well dressed. He did not care&#10;for his soldiers, and the theatre did not amuse him; the only&#10;thing, in fact, he thought anything of was to drive out and show a&#10;new suit of clothes. He had a coat for every hour of the day; and&#10;as one would say of a king &#34;He is in his cabinet,&#34; so one could say&#10;of him, &#34;The emperor is in his dressing-room.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The great city where he resided was very gay; every day&#10;many strangers from all parts of the globe arrived. One day two&#10;swindlers came to this city; they made people believe that they&#10;were weavers, and declared they could manufacture the finest cloth&#10;to be imagined. Their colours and patterns, they said, were not&#10;only exceptionally beautiful, but the clothes made of their&#10;material possessed the wonderful quality of being invisible to any&#10;man who was unfit for his office or unpardonably stupid.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That must be wonderful cloth,&#34; thought the emperor. &#34;If I&#10;were to be dressed in a suit made of this cloth I should be able to&#10;find out which men in my empire were unfit for their places, and I&#10;could distinguish the clever from the stupid. I must have this&#10;cloth woven for me without delay.&#34; And he gave a large sum of money&#10;to the swindlers, in advance, that they should set to work without&#10;any loss of time. They set up two looms, and pretended to be very&#10;hard at work, but they did nothing whatever on the looms. They&#10;asked for the finest silk and the most precious gold-cloth; all&#10;they got they did away with, and worked at the empty looms till&#10;late at night.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I should very much like to know how they are getting on&#10;with the cloth,&#34; thought the emperor. But he felt rather uneasy&#10;when he remembered that he who was not fit for his office could not&#10;see it. Personally, he was of opinion that he had nothing to fear,&#10;yet he thought it advisable to send somebody else first to see how&#10;matters stood. Everybody in the town knew what a remarkable quality&#10;the stuff possessed, and all were anxious to see how bad or stupid&#10;their neighbours were.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I shall send my honest old minister to the weavers,&#34;&#10;thought the emperor. &#34;He can judge best how the stuff looks, for he&#10;is intelligent, and nobody understands his office better than&#10;he.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The good old minister went into the room where the&#10;swindlers sat before the empty looms. &#34;Heaven preserve us!&#34; he&#10;thought, and opened his eyes wide, &#34;I cannot see anything at all,&#34;&#10;but he did not say so. Both swindlers requested him to come near,&#10;and asked him if he did not admire the exquisite pattern and the&#10;beautiful colours, pointing to the empty looms. The poor old&#10;minister tried his very best, but he could see nothing, for there&#10;was nothing to be seen. &#34;Oh dear,&#34; he thought, &#34;can I be so stupid?&#10;I should never have thought so, and nobody must know it! Is it&#10;possible that I am not fit for my office? No, no, I cannot say that&#10;I was unable to see the cloth.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Now, have you got nothing to say?&#34; said one of the&#10;swindlers, while he pretended to be busily weaving.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, it is very pretty, exceedingly beautiful,&#34; replied&#10;the old minister looking through his glasses. &#34;What a beautiful&#10;pattern, what brilliant colours! I shall tell the emperor that I&#10;like the cloth very much.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;We are pleased to hear that,&#34; said the two weavers, and&#10;described to him the colours and explained the curious pattern. The&#10;old minister listened attentively, that he might relate to the&#10;emperor what they said; and so he did.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Now the swindlers asked for more money, silk and&#10;gold-cloth, which they required for weaving. They kept everything&#10;for themselves, and not a thread came near the loom, but they&#10;continued, as hitherto, to work at the empty looms.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Soon afterwards the emperor sent another honest courtier&#10;to the weavers to see how they were getting on, and if the cloth&#10;was nearly finished. Like the old minister, he looked and looked&#10;but could see nothing, as there was nothing to be seen.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Is it not a beautiful piece of cloth?&#34; asked the two&#10;swindlers, showing and explaining the magnificent pattern, which,&#10;however, did not exist.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I am not stupid,&#34; said the man. &#34;It is therefore my good&#10;appointment for which I am not fit. It is very strange, but I must&#10;not let any one know it;&#34; and he praised the cloth, which he did&#10;not see, and expressed his joy at the beautiful colours and the&#10;fine pattern. &#34;It is very excellent,&#34; he said to the&#10;emperor.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Everybody in the whole town talked about the precious&#10;cloth. At last the emperor wished to see it himself, while it was&#10;still on the loom. With a number of courtiers, including the two&#10;who had already been there, he went to the two clever swindlers,&#10;who now worked as hard as they could, but without using any&#10;thread.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Is it not magnificent?&#34; said the two old statesmen who&#10;had been there before. &#34;Your Majesty must admire the colours and&#10;the pattern.&#34; And then they pointed to the empty looms, for they&#10;imagined the others could see the cloth.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What is this?&#34; thought the emperor, &#34;I do not see&#10;anything at all. That is terrible! Am I stupid? Am I unfit to be&#10;emperor? That would indeed be the most dreadful thing that could&#10;happen to me.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Really,&#34; he said, turning to the weavers, &#34;your cloth has&#10;our most gracious approval;&#34; and nodding contentedly he looked at&#10;the empty loom, for he did not like to say that he saw nothing. All&#10;his attendants, who were with him, looked and looked, and although&#10;they could not see anything more than the others, they said, like&#10;the emperor, &#34;It is very beautiful.&#34; And all advised him to wear&#10;the new magnificent clothes at a great procession which was soon to&#10;take place. &#34;It is magnificent, beautiful, excellent,&#34; one heard&#10;them say; everybody seemed to be delighted, and the emperor&#10;appointed the two swindlers &#34;Imperial Court weavers.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The whole night previous to the day on which the&#10;procession was to take place, the swindlers pretended to work, and&#10;burned more than sixteen candles. People should see that they were&#10;busy to finish the emperor&#39;s new suit. They pretended to take the&#10;cloth from the loom, and worked about in the air with big scissors,&#10;and sewed with needles without thread, and said at last: &#34;The&#10;emperor&#39;s new suit is ready now.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The emperor and all his barons then came to the hall; the&#10;swindlers held their arms up as if they held something in their&#10;hands and said: &#34;These are the trousers!&#34; &#34;This is the coat!&#34; and&#10;&#34;Here is the cloak!&#34; and so on. &#34;They are all as light as a cobweb,&#10;and one must feel as if one had nothing at all upon the body; but&#10;that is just the beauty of them.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Indeed!&#34; said all the courtiers; but they could not see&#10;anything, for there was nothing to be seen.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Does it please your Majesty now to graciously undress,&#34;&#10;said the swindlers, &#34;that we may assist your Majesty in putting on&#10;the new suit before the large looking-glass?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The emperor undressed, and the swindlers pretended to put&#10;the new suit upon him, one piece after another; and the emperor&#10;looked at himself in the glass from every side.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;How well they look! How well they fit!&#34; said all. &#34;What a&#10;beautiful pattern! What fine colours! That is a magnificent suit of&#10;clothes!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The master of the ceremonies announced that the bearers of&#10;the canopy, which was to be carried in the procession, were&#10;ready.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I am ready,&#34; said the emperor. &#34;Does not my suit fit me&#10;marvellously?&#34; Then he turned once more to the looking-glass, that&#10;people should think he admired his garments.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The chamberlains, who were to carry the train, stretched&#10;their hands to the ground as if they lifted up a train, and&#10;pretended to hold something in their hands; they did not like&#10;people to know that they could not see anything.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The emperor marched in the procession under the beautiful&#10;canopy, and all who saw him in the street and out of the windows&#10;exclaimed: &#34;Indeed, the emperor&#39;s new suit is incomparable! What a&#10;long train he has! How well it fits him!&#34; Nobody wished to let&#10;others know he saw nothing, for then he would have been unfit for&#10;his office or too stupid. Never emperor&#39;s clothes were more&#10;admired.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But he has nothing on at all,&#34; said a little child at&#10;last. &#34;Good heavens! listen to the voice of an innocent child,&#34;&#10;said the father, and one whispered to the other what the child had&#10;said. &#34;But he has nothing on at all,&#34; cried at last the whole&#10;people. That made a deep impression upon the emperor, for it seemed&#10;to him that they were right; but he thought to himself, &#34;Now I must&#10;bear up to the end.&#34; And the chamberlains walked with still greater&#10;dignity, as if they carried the train which did not exist.&#10;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Fir Tree'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;FAR down in the forest, where the warm sun and the fresh&#10;air made a sweet resting-place, grew a pretty little fir-tree; and&#10;yet it was not happy, it wished so much to be tall like its&#10;companions&#8212;the pines and firs which grew around it. The sun shone,&#10;and the soft air fluttered its leaves, and the little peasant&#10;children passed by, prattling merrily, but the fir-tree heeded them&#10;not. Sometimes the children would bring a large basket of&#10;raspberries or strawberries, wreathed on a straw, and seat&#10;themselves near the fir-tree, and say, &#34;Is it not a pretty little&#10;tree?&#34; which made it feel more unhappy than before. And yet all&#10;this while the tree grew a notch or joint taller every year; for by&#10;the number of joints in the stem of a fir-tree we can discover its&#10;age. Still, as it grew, it complained, &#34;Oh! how I wish I were as&#10;tall as the other trees, then I would spread out my branches on&#10;every side, and my top would over-look the wide world. I should&#10;have the birds building their nests on my boughs, and when the wind&#10;blew, I should bow with stately dignity like my tall companions.&#34;&#10;The tree was so discontented, that it took no pleasure in the warm&#10;sunshine, the birds, or the rosy clouds that floated over it&#10;morning and evening. Sometimes, in winter, when the snow lay white&#10;and glittering on the ground, a hare would come springing along,&#10;and jump right over the little tree; and then how mortified it&#10;would feel! Two winters passed, and when the third arrived, the&#10;tree had grown so tall that the hare was obliged to run round it.&#10;Yet it remained unsatisfied, and would exclaim, &#34;Oh, if I could but&#10;keep on growing tall and old! There is nothing else worth caring&#10;for in the world!&#34; In the autumn, as usual, the wood-cutters came&#10;and cut down several of the tallest trees, and the young fir-tree,&#10;which was now grown to its full height, shuddered as the noble&#10;trees fell to the earth with a crash. After the branches were&#10;lopped off, the trunks looked so slender and bare, that they could&#10;scarcely be recognized. Then they were placed upon wagons, and&#10;drawn by horses out of the forest. &#34;Where were they going? What&#10;would become of them?&#34; The young fir-tree wished very much to know;&#10;so in the spring, when the swallows and the storks came, it asked,&#10;&#34;Do you know where those trees were taken? Did you meet&#10;them?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The swallows knew nothing, but the stork, after a little&#10;reflection, nodded his head, and said, &#34;Yes, I think I do. I met&#10;several new ships when I flew from Egypt, and they had fine masts&#10;that smelt like fir. I think these must have been the trees; I&#10;assure you they were stately, very stately.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, how I wish I were tall enough to go on the sea,&#34; said&#10;the fir-tree. &#34;What is the sea, and what does it look&#10;like?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It would take too much time to explain,&#34; said the stork,&#10;flying quickly away.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Rejoice in thy youth,&#34; said the sunbeam; &#34;rejoice in thy&#10;fresh growth, and the young life that is in thee.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the wind kissed the tree, and the dew watered it with&#10;tears; but the fir-tree regarded them not.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Christmas-time drew near, and many young trees were cut&#10;down, some even smaller and younger than the fir-tree who enjoyed&#10;neither rest nor peace with longing to leave its forest home. These&#10;young trees, which were chosen for their beauty, kept their&#10;branches, and were also laid on wagons and drawn by horses out of&#10;the forest.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Where are they going?&#34; asked the fir-tree. &#34;They are not&#10;taller than I am: indeed, one is much less; and why are the&#10;branches not cut off? Where are they going?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;We know, we know,&#34; sang the sparrows; &#34;we have looked in&#10;at the windows of the houses in the town, and we know what is done&#10;with them. They are dressed up in the most splendid manner. We have&#10;seen them standing in the middle of a warm room, and adorned with&#10;all sorts of beautiful things,&#8212;honey cakes, gilded apples,&#10;playthings, and many hundreds of wax tapers.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And then,&#34; asked the fir-tree, trembling through all its&#10;branches, &#34;and then what happens?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;We did not see any more,&#34; said the sparrows; &#34;but this&#10;was enough for us.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I wonder whether anything so brilliant will ever happen&#10;to me,&#34; thought the fir-tree. &#34;It would be much better than&#10;crossing the sea. I long for it almost with pain. Oh! when will&#10;Christmas be here? I am now as tall and well grown as those which&#10;were taken away last year. Oh! that I were now laid on the wagon,&#10;or standing in the warm room, with all that brightness and splendor&#10;around me! Something better and more beautiful is to come after, or&#10;the trees would not be so decked out. Yes, what follows will be&#10;grander and more splendid. What can it be? I am weary with longing.&#10;I scarcely know how I feel.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Rejoice with us,&#34; said the air and the sunlight. &#34;Enjoy&#10;thine own bright life in the fresh air.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But the tree would not rejoice, though it grew taller&#10;every day; and, winter and summer, its dark-green foliage might be&#10;seen in the forest, while passers by would say, &#34;What a beautiful&#10;tree!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A short time before Christmas, the discontented fir-tree&#10;was the first to fall. As the axe cut through the stem, and divided&#10;the pith, the tree fell with a groan to the earth, conscious of&#10;pain and faintness, and forgetting all its anticipations of&#10;happiness, in sorrow at leaving its home in the forest. It knew&#10;that it should never again see its dear old companions, the trees,&#10;nor the little bushes and many-colored flowers that had grown by&#10;its side; perhaps not even the birds. Neither was the journey at&#10;all pleasant. The tree first recovered itself while being unpacked&#10;in the courtyard of a house, with several other trees; and it heard&#10;a man say, &#34;We only want one, and this is the&#10;prettiest.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then came two servants in grand livery, and carried the&#10;fir-tree into a large and beautiful apartment. On the walls hung&#10;pictures, and near the great stove stood great china vases, with&#10;lions on the lids. There were rocking chairs, silken sofas, large&#10;tables, covered with pictures, books, and playthings, worth a great&#10;deal of money,&#8212;at least, the children said so. Then the fir-tree&#10;was placed in a large tub, full of sand; but green baize hung all&#10;around it, so that no one could see it was a tub, and it stood on a&#10;very handsome carpet. How the fir-tree trembled! &#34;What was going to&#10;happen to him now?&#34; Some young ladies came, and the servants helped&#10;them to adorn the tree. On one branch they hung little bags cut out&#10;of colored paper, and each bag was filled with sweetmeats; from&#10;other branches hung gilded apples and walnuts, as if they had grown&#10;there; and above, and all round, were hundreds of red, blue, and&#10;white tapers, which were fastened on the branches. Dolls, exactly&#10;like real babies, were placed under the green leaves,&#8212;the tree had&#10;never seen such things before,&#8212;and at the very top was fastened a&#10;glittering star, made of tinsel. Oh, it was very&#10;beautiful!&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;This evening,&#34; they all exclaimed, &#34;how bright it will&#10;be!&#34; &#34;Oh, that the evening were come,&#34; thought the tree, &#34;and the&#10;tapers lighted! then I shall know what else is going to happen.&#10;Will the trees of the forest come to see me? I wonder if the&#10;sparrows will peep in at the windows as they fly? shall I grow&#10;faster here, and keep on all these ornaments summer and winter?&#34;&#10;But guessing was of very little use; it made his bark ache, and&#10;this pain is as bad for a slender fir-tree, as headache is for us.&#10;At last the tapers were lighted, and then what a glistening blaze&#10;of light the tree presented! It trembled so with joy in all its&#10;branches, that one of the candles fell among the green leaves and&#10;burnt some of them. &#34;Help! help!&#34; exclaimed the young ladies, but&#10;there was no danger, for they quickly extinguished the fire. After&#10;this, the tree tried not to tremble at all, though the fire&#10;frightened him; he was so anxious not to hurt any of the beautiful&#10;ornaments, even while their brilliancy dazzled him. And now the&#10;folding doors were thrown open, and a troop of children rushed in&#10;as if they intended to upset the tree; they were followed more&#10;silently by their elders. For a moment the little ones stood silent&#10;with astonishment, and then they shouted for joy, till the room&#10;rang, and they danced merrily round the tree, while one present&#10;after another was taken from it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What are they doing? What will happen next?&#34; thought the&#10;fir. At last the candles burnt down to the branches and were put&#10;out. Then the children received permission to plunder the&#10;tree.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Oh, how they rushed upon it, till the branches cracked,&#10;and had it not been fastened with the glistening star to the&#10;ceiling, it must have been thrown down. The children then danced&#10;about with their pretty toys, and no one noticed the tree, except&#10;the children&#39;s maid who came and peeped among the branches to see&#10;if an apple or a fig had been forgotten.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;A story, a story,&#34; cried the children, pulling a little&#10;fat man towards the tree.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Now we shall be in the green shade,&#34; said the man, as he&#10;seated himself under it, &#34;and the tree will have the pleasure of&#10;hearing also, but I shall only relate one story; what shall it be?&#10;Ivede-Avede, or Humpty Dumpty, who fell down stairs, but soon got&#10;up again, and at last married a princess.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ivede-Avede,&#34; cried some. &#34;Humpty Dumpty,&#34; cried others,&#10;and there was a fine shouting and crying out. But the fir-tree&#10;remained quite still, and thought to himself, &#34;Shall I have&#10;anything to do with all this?&#34; but he had already amused them as&#10;much as they wished. Then the old man told them the story of Humpty&#10;Dumpty, how he fell down stairs, and was raised up again, and&#10;married a princess. And the children clapped their hands and cried,&#10;&#34;Tell another, tell another,&#34; for they wanted to hear the story of&#10;&#34;Ivede-Avede;&#34; but they only had &#34;Humpty Dumpty.&#34; After this the&#10;fir-tree became quite silent and thoughtful; never had the birds in&#10;the forest told such tales as &#34;Humpty Dumpty,&#34; who fell down&#10;stairs, and yet married a princess.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ah! yes, so it happens in the world,&#34; thought the&#10;fir-tree; he believed it all, because it was related by such a nice&#10;man. &#34;Ah! well,&#34; he thought, &#34;who knows? perhaps I may fall down&#10;too, and marry a princess;&#34; and he looked forward joyfully to the&#10;next evening, expecting to be again decked out with lights and&#10;playthings, gold and fruit. &#34;To-morrow I will not tremble,&#34; thought&#10;he; &#34;I will enjoy all my splendor, and I shall hear the story of&#10;Humpty Dumpty again, and perhaps Ivede-Avede.&#34; And the tree&#10;remained quiet and thoughtful all night. In the morning the&#10;servants and the housemaid came in. &#34;Now,&#34; thought the fir, &#34;all my&#10;splendor is going to begin again.&#34; But they dragged him out of the&#10;room and up stairs to the garret, and threw him on the floor, in a&#10;dark corner, where no daylight shone, and there they left him.&#10;&#34;What does this mean?&#34; thought the tree, &#34;what am I to do here? I&#10;can hear nothing in a place like this,&#34; and he had time enough to&#10;think, for days and nights passed and no one came near him, and&#10;when at last somebody did come, it was only to put away large boxes&#10;in a corner. So the tree was completely hidden from sight as if it&#10;had never existed. &#34;It is winter now,&#34; thought the tree, &#34;the&#10;ground is hard and covered with snow, so that people cannot plant&#10;me. I shall be sheltered here, I dare say, until spring comes. How&#10;thoughtful and kind everybody is to me! Still I wish this place&#10;were not so dark, as well as lonely, with not even a little hare to&#10;look at. How pleasant it was out in the forest while the snow lay&#10;on the ground, when the hare would run by, yes, and jump over me&#10;too, although I did not like it then. Oh! it is terrible lonely&#10;here.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Squeak, squeak,&#34; said a little mouse, creeping cautiously&#10;towards the tree; then came another; and they both sniffed at the&#10;fir-tree and crept between the branches.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, it is very cold,&#34; said the little mouse, &#34;or else we&#10;should be so comfortable here, shouldn&#39;t we, you old&#10;fir-tree?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I am not old,&#34; said the fir-tree, &#34;there are many who are&#10;older than I am.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Where do you come from? and what do you know?&#34; asked the&#10;mice, who were full of curiosity. &#34;Have you seen the most beautiful&#10;places in the world, and can you tell us all about them? and have&#10;you been in the storeroom, where cheeses lie on the shelf, and hams&#10;hang from the ceiling? One can run about on tallow candles there,&#10;and go in thin and come out fat.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I know nothing of that place,&#34; said the fir-tree, &#34;but I&#10;know the wood where the sun shines and the birds sing.&#34; And then&#10;the tree told the little mice all about its youth. They had never&#10;heard such an account in their lives; and after they had listened&#10;to it attentively, they said, &#34;What a number of things you have&#10;seen? you must have been very happy.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Happy!&#34; exclaimed the fir-tree, and then as he reflected&#10;upon what he had been telling them, he said, &#34;Ah, yes! after all&#10;those were happy days.&#34; But when he went on and related all about&#10;Christmas-eve, and how he had been dressed up with cakes and&#10;lights, the mice said, &#34;How happy you must have been, you old&#10;fir-tree.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I am not old at all,&#34; replied the tree, &#34;I only came from&#10;the forest this winter, I am now checked in my growth.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What splendid stories you can relate,&#34; said the little&#10;mice. And the next night four other mice came with them to hear&#10;what the tree had to tell. The more he talked the more he&#10;remembered, and then he thought to himself, &#34;Those were happy days,&#10;but they may come again. Humpty Dumpty fell down stairs, and yet he&#10;married the princess; perhaps I may marry a princess too.&#34; And the&#10;fir-tree thought of the pretty little birch-tree that grew in the&#10;forest, which was to him a real beautiful princess.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Who is Humpty Dumpty?&#34; asked the little mice. And then&#10;the tree related the whole story; he could remember every single&#10;word, and the little mice was so delighted with it, that they were&#10;ready to jump to the top of the tree. The next night a great many&#10;more mice made their appearance, and on Sunday two rats came with&#10;them; but they said, it was not a pretty story at all, and the&#10;little mice were very sorry, for it made them also think less of&#10;it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Do you know only one story?&#34; asked the rats.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Only one,&#34; replied the fir-tree; &#34;I heard it on the&#10;happiest evening of my life; but I did not know I was so happy at&#10;the time.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;We think it is a very miserable story,&#34; said the rats.&#10;&#34;Don&#39;t you know any story about bacon, or tallow in the&#10;storeroom.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No,&#34; replied the tree.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Many thanks to you then,&#34; replied the rats, and they&#10;marched off.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The little mice also kept away after this, and the tree&#10;sighed, and said, &#34;It was very pleasant when the merry little mice&#10;sat round me and listened while I talked. Now that is all passed&#10;too. However, I shall consider myself happy when some one comes to&#10;take me out of this place.&#34; But would this ever happen? Yes; one&#10;morning people came to clear out the garret, the boxes were packed&#10;away, and the tree was pulled out of the corner, and thrown roughly&#10;on the garret floor; then the servant dragged it out upon the&#10;staircase where the daylight shone. &#34;Now life is beginning again,&#34;&#10;said the tree, rejoicing in the sunshine and fresh air. Then it was&#10;carried down stairs and taken into the courtyard so quickly, that&#10;it forgot to think of itself, and could only look about, there was&#10;so much to be seen. The court was close to a garden, where&#10;everything looked blooming. Fresh and fragrant roses hung over the&#10;little palings. The linden-trees were in blossom; while the&#10;swallows flew here and there, crying, &#34;Twit, twit, twit, my mate is&#10;coming,&#34;&#8212;but it was not the fir-tree they meant. &#34;Now I shall&#10;live,&#34; cried the tree, joyfully spreading out its branches; but&#10;alas! they were all withered and yellow, and it lay in a corner&#10;amongst weeds and nettles. The star of gold paper still stuck in&#10;the top of the tree and glittered in the sunshine. In the same&#10;courtyard two of the merry children were playing who had danced&#10;round the tree at Christmas, and had been so happy. The youngest&#10;saw the gilded star, and ran and pulled it off the tree. &#34;Look what&#10;is sticking to the ugly old fir-tree,&#34; said the child, treading on&#10;the branches till they crackled under his boots. And the tree saw&#10;all the fresh bright flowers in the garden, and then looked at&#10;itself, and wished it had remained in the dark corner of the&#10;garret. It thought of its fresh youth in the forest, of the merry&#10;Christmas evening, and of the little mice who had listened to the&#10;story of &#34;Humpty Dumpty.&#34; &#34;Past! past!&#34; said the old tree; &#34;Oh, had&#10;I but enjoyed myself while I could have done so! but now it is too&#10;late.&#34; Then a lad came and chopped the tree into small pieces, till&#10;a large bundle lay in a heap on the ground. The pieces were placed&#10;in a fire under the copper, and they quickly blazed up brightly,&#10;while the tree sighed so deeply that each sigh was like a&#10;pistol-shot. Then the children, who were at play, came and seated&#10;themselves in front of the fire, and looked at it and cried, &#34;Pop,&#10;pop.&#34; But at each &#34;pop,&#34; which was a deep sigh, the tree was&#10;thinking of a summer day in the forest; and of Christmas evening,&#10;and of &#34;Humpty Dumpty,&#34; the only story it had ever heard or knew&#10;how to relate, till at last it was consumed. The boys still played&#10;in the garden, and the youngest wore the golden star on his breast,&#10;with which the tree had been adorned during the happiest evening of&#10;its existence. Now all was past; the tree&#39;s life was past, and the&#10;story also,&#8212;for all stories must come to an end at last.&#10;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Flax'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;THE flax was in full bloom; it had pretty little blue&#10;flowers as delicate as the wings of a moth, or even more so. The&#10;sun shone, and the showers watered it; and this was just as good&#10;for the flax as it is for little children to be washed and then&#10;kissed by their mother. They look much prettier for it, and so did&#10;the flax.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;People say that I look exceedingly well,&#34; said the flax,&#10;&#34;and that I am so fine and long that I shall make a beautiful piece&#10;of linen. How fortunate I am; it makes me so happy, it is such a&#10;pleasant thing to know that something can be made of me. How the&#10;sunshine cheers me, and how sweet and refreshing is the rain; my&#10;happiness overpowers me, no one in the world can feel happier than&#10;I am.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ah, yes, no doubt,&#34; said the fern, &#34;but you do not know&#10;the world yet as well as I do, for my sticks are knotty;&#34; and then&#10;it sung quite mournfully&#8212;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Snip, snap, snurre,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Basse lurre:&#60;br /&#62;&#10;The song is ended.&#34;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No, it is not ended,&#34; said the flax. &#34;To-morrow the sun&#10;will shine, or the rain descend. I feel that I am growing. I feel&#10;that I am in full blossom. I am the happiest of all&#10;creatures.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Well, one day some people came, who took hold of the flax,&#10;and pulled it up by the roots; this was painful; then it was laid&#10;in water as if they intended to drown it; and, after that, placed&#10;near a fire as if it were to be roasted; all this was very&#10;shocking. &#34;We cannot expect to be happy always,&#34; said the flax; &#34;by&#10;experiencing evil as well as good, we become wise.&#34; And certainly&#10;there was plenty of evil in store for the flax. It was steeped, and&#10;roasted, and broken, and combed; indeed, it scarcely knew what was&#10;done to it. At last it was put on the spinning wheel. &#34;Whirr,&#10;whirr,&#34; went the wheel so quickly that the flax could not collect&#10;its thoughts. &#34;Well, I have been very happy,&#34; he thought in the&#10;midst of his pain, &#34;and must be contented with the past;&#34; and&#10;contented he remained till he was put on the loom, and became a&#10;beautiful piece of white linen. All the flax, even to the last&#10;stalk, was used in making this one piece. &#34;Well, this is quite&#10;wonderful; I could not have believed that I should be so favored by&#10;fortune. The fern was not wrong with its song of&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#39;Snip, snap, snurre,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Basse lurre.&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But the song is not ended yet, I am sure; it is only just&#10;beginning. How wonderful it is, that after all I have suffered, I&#10;am made something of at last; I am the luckiest person in the&#10;world&#8212;so strong and fine; and how white, and what a length! This is&#10;something different to being a mere plant and bearing flowers. Then&#10;I had no attention, nor any water unless it rained; now, I am&#10;watched and taken care of. Every morning the maid turns me over,&#10;and I have a shower-bath from the watering-pot every evening. Yes,&#10;and the clergyman&#39;s wife noticed me, and said I was the best piece&#10;of linen in the whole parish. I cannot be happier than I am&#10;now.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;After some time, the linen was taken into the house,&#10;placed under the scissors, and cut and torn into pieces, and then&#10;pricked with needles. This certainly was not pleasant; but at last&#10;it was made into twelve garments of that kind which people do not&#10;like to name, and yet everybody should wear one. &#34;See, now, then,&#34;&#10;said the flax; &#34;I have become something of importance. This was my&#10;destiny; it is quite a blessing. Now I shall be of some use in the&#10;world, as everyone ought to be; it is the only way to be happy. I&#10;am now divided into twelve pieces, and yet we are all one and the&#10;same in the whole dozen. It is most extraordinary good&#10;fortune.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Years passed away, and at last the linen was so worn it&#10;could scarcely hold together. &#34;It must end very soon,&#34; said the&#10;pieces to each other; &#34;we would gladly have held together a little&#10;longer, but it is useless to expect impossibilities.&#34; And at length&#10;they fell into rags and tatters, and thought it was all over with&#10;them, for they were torn to shreds, and steeped in water, and made&#10;into a pulp, and dried, and they knew not what besides, till all at&#10;once they found themselves beautiful white paper. &#34;Well, now, this&#10;is a surprise; a glorious surprise too,&#34; said the paper. &#34;I am now&#10;finer than ever, and I shall be written upon, and who can tell what&#10;fine things I may have written upon me. This is wonderful luck!&#34;&#10;And sure enough the most beautiful stories and poetry were written&#10;upon it, and only once was there a blot, which was very fortunate.&#10;Then people heard the stories and poetry read, and it made them&#10;wiser and better; for all that was written had a good and sensible&#10;meaning, and a great blessing was contained in the words on this&#10;paper.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I never imagined anything like this,&#34; said the paper,&#10;&#34;when I was only a little blue flower, growing in the fields. How&#10;could I fancy that I should ever be the means of bringing knowledge&#10;and joy to man? I cannot understand it myself, and yet it is really&#10;so. Heaven knows that I have done nothing myself, but what I was&#10;obliged to do with my weak powers for my own preservation; and yet&#10;I have been promoted from one joy and honor to another. Each time I&#10;think that the song is ended; and then something higher and better&#10;begins for me. I suppose now I shall be sent on my travels about&#10;the world, so that people may read me. It cannot be otherwise;&#10;indeed, it is more than probable; for I have more splendid thoughts&#10;written upon me, than I had pretty flowers in olden times. I am&#10;happier than ever.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But the paper did not go on its travels; it was sent to&#10;the printer, and all the words written upon it were set up in type,&#10;to make a book, or rather, many hundreds of books; for so many more&#10;persons could derive pleasure and profit from a printed book, than&#10;from the written paper; and if the paper had been sent around the&#10;world, it would have been worn out before it had got half through&#10;its journey.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;This is certainly the wisest plan,&#34; said the written&#10;paper; &#34;I really did not think of that. I shall remain at home, and&#10;be held in honor, like some old grandfather, as I really am to all&#10;these new books. They will do some good. I could not have wandered&#10;about as they do. Yet he who wrote all this has looked at me, as&#10;every word flowed from his pen upon my surface. I am the most&#10;honored of all.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the paper was tied in a bundle with other papers, and&#10;thrown into a tub that stood in the washhouse.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;After work, it is well to rest,&#34; said the paper, &#34;and a&#10;very good opportunity to collect one&#39;s thoughts. Now I am able, for&#10;the first time, to think of my real condition; and to know one&#39;s&#10;self is true progress. What will be done with me now, I wonder? No&#10;doubt I shall still go forward. I have always progressed hitherto,&#10;as I know quite well.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Now it happened one day that all the paper in the tub was&#10;taken out, and laid on the hearth to be burnt. People said it could&#10;not be sold at the shop, to wrap up butter and sugar, because it&#10;had been written upon. The children in the house stood round the&#10;stove; for they wanted to see the paper burn, because it flamed up&#10;so prettily, and afterwards, among the ashes, so many red sparks&#10;could be seen running one after the other, here and there, as quick&#10;as the wind. They called it seeing the children come out of school,&#10;and the last spark was the schoolmaster. They often thought the&#10;last spark had come; and one would cry, &#34;There goes the&#10;schoolmaster;&#34; but the next moment another spark would appear,&#10;shining so beautifully. How they would like to know where the&#10;sparks all went to! Perhaps we shall find out some day, but we&#10;don&#39;t know now.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The whole bundle of paper had been placed on the fire, and&#10;was soon alight. &#34;Ugh,&#34; cried the paper, as it burst into a bright&#10;flame; &#34;ugh.&#34; It was certainly not very pleasant to be burning; but&#10;when the whole was wrapped in flames, the flames mounted up into&#10;the air, higher than the flax had ever been able to raise its&#10;little blue flower, and they glistened as the white linen never&#10;could have glistened. All the written letters became quite red in a&#10;moment, and all the words and thoughts turned to fire.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Now I am mounting straight up to the sun,&#34; said a voice&#10;in the flames; and it was as if a thousand voices echoed the words;&#10;and the flames darted up through the chimney, and went out at the&#10;top. Then a number of tiny beings, as many in number as the flowers&#10;on the flax had been, and invisible to mortal eyes, floated above&#10;them. They were even lighter and more delicate than the flowers&#10;from which they were born; and as the flames were extinguished, and&#10;nothing remained of the paper but black ashes, these little beings&#10;danced upon it; and whenever they touched it, bright red sparks&#10;appeared.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The children are all out of school, and the schoolmaster&#10;was the last of all,&#34; said the children. It was good fun, and they&#10;sang over the dead ashes,&#8212;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Snip, snap, snurre,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Basse lure:&#60;br /&#62;&#10;The song is ended.&#34;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But the little invisible beings said, &#34;The song is never&#10;ended; the most beautiful is yet to come.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But the children could neither hear nor understand this,&#10;nor should they; for children must not know everything.&#10;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Flying Trunk'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;THERE was once a merchant who was so rich that he could&#10;have paved the whole street with gold, and would even then have had&#10;enough for a small alley. But he did not do so; he knew the value&#10;of money better than to use it in this way. So clever was he, that&#10;every shilling he put out brought him a crown; and so he continued&#10;till he died. His son inherited his wealth, and he lived a merry&#10;life with it; he went to a masquerade every night, made kites out&#10;of five pound notes, and threw pieces of gold into the sea instead&#10;of stones, making ducks and drakes of them. In this manner he soon&#10;lost all his money. At last he had nothing left but a pair of&#10;slippers, an old dressing-gown, and four shillings. And now all his&#10;friends deserted him, they could not walk with him in the streets;&#10;but one of them, who was very good-natured, sent him an old trunk&#10;with this message, &#34;Pack up!&#34; &#34;Yes,&#34; he said, &#34;it is all very well&#10;to say &#39;pack up,&#39; &#34;but he had nothing left to pack up, therefore he&#10;seated himself in the trunk. It was a very wonderful trunk; no&#10;sooner did any one press on the lock than the trunk could fly. He&#10;shut the lid and pressed the lock, when away flew the trunk up the&#10;chimney with the merchant&#39;s son in it, right up into the clouds.&#10;Whenever the bottom of the trunk cracked, he was in a great fright,&#10;for if the trunk fell to pieces he would have made a tremendous&#10;somerset over the trees. However, he got safely in his trunk to the&#10;land of Turkey. He hid the trunk in the wood under some dry leaves,&#10;and then went into the town: he could so this very well, for the&#10;Turks always go about dressed in dressing-gowns and slippers, as he&#10;was himself. He happened to meet a nurse with a little child. &#34;I&#10;say, you Turkish nurse,&#34; cried he, &#34;what castle is that near the&#10;town, with the windows placed so high?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The king&#39;s daughter lives there,&#34; she replied; &#34;it has&#10;been prophesied that she will be very unhappy about a lover, and&#10;therefore no one is allowed to visit her, unless the king and queen&#10;are present.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Thank you,&#34; said the merchant&#39;s son. So he went back to&#10;the wood, seated himself in his trunk, flew up to the roof of the&#10;castle, and crept through the window into the princess&#39;s room. She&#10;lay on the sofa asleep, and she was so beautiful that the&#10;merchant&#39;s son could not help kissing her. Then she awoke, and was&#10;very much frightened; but he told her he was a Turkish angel, who&#10;had come down through the air to see her, which pleased her very&#10;much. He sat down by her side and talked to her: he said her eyes&#10;were like beautiful dark lakes, in which the thoughts swam about&#10;like little mermaids, and he told her that her forehead was a snowy&#10;mountain, which contained splendid halls full of pictures. And then&#10;he related to her about the stork who brings the beautiful children&#10;from the rivers. These were delightful stories; and when he asked&#10;the princess if she would marry him, she consented&#10;immediately.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But you must come on Saturday,&#34; she said; &#34;for then the&#10;king and queen will take tea with me. They will be very proud when&#10;they find that I am going to marry a Turkish angel; but you must&#10;think of some very pretty stories to tell them, for my parents like&#10;to hear stories better than anything. My mother prefers one that is&#10;deep and moral; but my father likes something funny, to make him&#10;laugh.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Very well,&#34; he replied; &#34;I shall bring you no other&#10;marriage portion than a story,&#34; and so they parted. But the&#10;princess gave him a sword which was studded with gold coins, and&#10;these he could use.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then he flew away to the town and bought a new&#10;dressing-gown, and afterwards returned to the wood, where he&#10;composed a story, so as to be ready for Saturday, which was no easy&#10;matter. It was ready however by Saturday, when he went to see the&#10;princess. The king, and queen, and the whole court, were at tea&#10;with the princess; and he was received with great&#10;politeness.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Will you tell us a story?&#34; said the queen,&#8212;&#34;one that is&#10;instructive and full of deep learning.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, but with something in it to laugh at,&#34; said the&#10;king.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Certainly,&#34; he replied, and commenced at once, asking&#10;them to listen attentively. &#34;There was once a bundle of matches&#10;that were exceedingly proud of their high descent. Their&#10;genealogical tree, that is, a large pine-tree from which they had&#10;been cut, was at one time a large, old tree in the wood. The&#10;matches now lay between a tinder-box and an old iron saucepan, and&#10;were talking about their youthful days. &#39;Ah! then we grew on the&#10;green boughs, and were as green as they; every morning and evening&#10;we were fed with diamond drops of dew. Whenever the sun shone, we&#10;felt his warm rays, and the little birds would relate stories to us&#10;as they sung. We knew that we were rich, for the other trees only&#10;wore their green dress in summer, but our family were able to array&#10;themselves in green, summer and winter. But the wood-cutter came,&#10;like a great revolution, and our family fell under the axe. The&#10;head of the house obtained a situation as mainmast in a very fine&#10;ship, and can sail round the world when he will. The other branches&#10;of the family were taken to different places, and our office now is&#10;to kindle a light for common people. This is how such high-born&#10;people as we came to be in a kitchen.&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;Mine has been a very different fate,&#39; said the iron pot,&#10;which stood by the matches; &#39;from my first entrance into the world&#10;I have been used to cooking and scouring. I am the first in this&#10;house, when anything solid or useful is required. My only pleasure&#10;is to be made clean and shining after dinner, and to sit in my&#10;place and have a little sensible conversation with my neighbors.&#10;All of us, excepting the water-bucket, which is sometimes taken&#10;into the courtyard, live here together within these four walls. We&#10;get our news from the market-basket, but he sometimes tells us very&#10;unpleasant things about the people and the government. Yes, and one&#10;day an old pot was so alarmed, that he fell down and was broken to&#10;pieces. He was a liberal, I can tell you.&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;You are talking too much,&#39; said the tinder-box, and the&#10;steel struck against the flint till some sparks flew out, crying,&#10;&#39;We want a merry evening, don&#39;t we?&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;Yes, of course,&#39; said the matches, &#39;let us talk about&#10;those who are the highest born.&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;No, I don&#39;t like to be always talking of what we are,&#39;&#10;remarked the saucepan; &#39;let us think of some other amusement; I&#10;will begin. We will tell something that has happened to ourselves;&#10;that will be very easy, and interesting as well. On the Baltic Sea,&#10;near the Danish shore&#39;&#8212;&#34;&#39;What a pretty commencement!&#39; said the&#10;plates; &#39;we shall all like that story, I am sure.&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;Yes; well in my youth, I lived in a quiet family, where&#10;the furniture was polished, the floors scoured, and clean curtains&#10;put up every fortnight,&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;What an interesting way you have of relating a story,&#39;&#10;said the carpet-broom; &#39;it is easy to perceive that you have been a&#10;great deal in women&#39;s society, there is something so pure runs&#10;through what you say.&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;That is quite true,&#39; said the water-bucket; and he made&#10;a spring with joy, and splashed some water on the floor.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Then the saucepan went on with his story, and the end was&#10;as good as the beginning.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The plates rattled with pleasure, and the carpet-broom&#10;brought some green parsley out of the dust-hole and crowned the&#10;saucepan, for he knew it would vex the others; and he thought, &#39;If&#10;I crown him to-day he will crown me to-morrow.&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;Now, let us have a dance,&#39; said the fire-tongs; and then&#10;how they danced and stuck up one leg in the air. The chair-cushion&#10;in the corner burst with laughter when she saw it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;Shall I be crowned now?&#39; asked the fire-tongs; so the&#10;broom found another wreath for the tongs.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;They were only common people after all,&#39; thought the&#10;matches. The tea-urn was now asked to sing, but she said she had a&#10;cold, and could not sing without boiling heat. They all thought&#10;this was affectation, and because she did not wish to sing&#10;excepting in the parlor, when on the table with the grand&#10;people.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;In the window sat an old quill-pen, with which the maid&#10;generally wrote. There was nothing remarkable about the pen,&#10;excepting that it had been dipped too deeply in the ink, but it was&#10;proud of that.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;If the tea-urn won&#39;t sing,&#39; said the pen, &#39;she can leave&#10;it alone; there is a nightingale in a cage who can sing; she has&#10;not been taught much, certainly, but we need not say anything this&#10;evening about that.&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;I think it highly improper,&#39; said the tea-kettle, who&#10;was kitchen singer, and half-brother to the tea-urn, &#39;that a rich&#10;foreign bird should be listened to here. Is it patriotic? Let the&#10;market-basket decide what is right.&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;I certainly am vexed,&#39; said the basket; &#39;inwardly vexed,&#10;more than any one can imagine. Are we spending the evening&#10;properly? Would it not be more sensible to put the house in order?&#10;If each were in his own place I would lead a game; this would be&#10;quite another thing.&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;Let us act a play,&#39; said they all. At the same moment&#10;the door opened, and the maid came in. Then not one stirred; they&#10;all remained quite still; yet, at the same time, there was not a&#10;single pot amongst them who had not a high opinion of himself, and&#10;of what he could do if he chose.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;Yes, if we had chosen,&#39; they each thought, &#39;we might&#10;have spent a very pleasant evening.&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The maid took the matches and lighted them; dear me, how&#10;they sputtered and blazed up!&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;Now then,&#39; they thought, &#39;every one will see that we are&#10;the first. How we shine; what a light we give!&#39; Even while they&#10;spoke their light went out.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What a capital story,&#34; said the queen, &#34;I feel as if I&#10;were really in the kitchen, and could see the matches; yes, you&#10;shall marry our daughter.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Certainly,&#34; said the king, &#34;thou shalt have our&#10;daughter.&#34; The king said thou to him because he was going to be one&#10;of the family. The wedding-day was fixed, and, on the evening&#10;before, the whole city was illuminated. Cakes and sweetmeats were&#10;thrown among the people. The street boys stood on tiptoe and&#10;shouted &#34;hurrah,&#34; and whistled between their fingers; altogether it&#10;was a very splendid affair.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I will give them another treat,&#34; said the merchant&#39;s son.&#10;So he went and bought rockets and crackers, and all sorts of&#10;fire-works that could be thought of, packed them in his trunk, and&#10;flew up with it into the air. What a whizzing and popping they made&#10;as they went off! The Turks, when they saw such a sight in the air,&#10;jumped so high that their slippers flew about their ears. It was&#10;easy to believe after this that the princess was really going to&#10;marry a Turkish angel.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;As soon as the merchant&#39;s son had come down in his flying&#10;trunk to the wood after the fireworks, he thought, &#34;I will go back&#10;into the town now, and hear what they think of the entertainment.&#34;&#10;It was very natural that he should wish to know. And what strange&#10;things people did say, to be sure! every one whom he questioned had&#10;a different tale to tell, though they all thought it very&#10;beautiful.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;I saw the Turkish angel myself,&#34; said one; &#34;he had eyes&#10;like glittering stars, and a head like foaming water.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;He flew in a mantle of fire,&#34; cried another, &#34;and lovely&#10;little cherubs peeped out from the folds.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;He heard many more fine things about himself, and that the&#10;next day he was to be married. After this he went back to the&#10;forest to rest himself in his trunk. It had disappeared! A spark&#10;from the fireworks which remained had set it on fire; it was burnt&#10;to ashes! So the merchant&#39;s son could not fly any more, nor go to&#10;meet his bride. She stood all day on the roof waiting for him, and&#10;most likely she is waiting there still; while he wanders through&#10;the world telling fairy tales, but none of them so amusing as the&#10;one he related about the matches. &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Shepherd&#39;s Story of the Bond of Friendship'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;THE little dwelling in which we lived was of clay, but the&#10;door-posts were columns of fluted marble, found near the spot on&#10;which it stood. The roof sloped nearly to the ground. It was at&#10;this time dark, brown, and ugly, but had originally been formed of&#10;blooming olive and laurel branches, brought from beyond the&#10;mountains. The house was situated in a narrow gorge, whose rocky&#10;walls rose to a perpendicular height, naked and black, while round&#10;their summits clouds often hung, looking like white living figures.&#10;Not a singing bird was ever heard there, neither did men dance to&#10;the sound of the pipe. The spot was one sacred to olden times; even&#10;its name recalled a memory of the days when it was called &#34;Delphi.&#34;&#10;Then the summits of the dark, sacred mountains were covered with&#10;snow, and the highest, mount Parnassus, glowed longest in the red&#10;evening light. The brook which rolled from it near our house, was&#10;also sacred. How well I can remember every spot in that deep,&#10;sacred solitude! A fire had been kindled in the midst of the hut,&#10;and while the hot ashes lay there red and glowing, the bread was&#10;baked in them. At times the snow would be piled so high around our&#10;hut as almost to hide it, and then my mother appeared most&#10;cheerful. She would hold my head between her hands, and sing the&#10;songs she never sang at other times, for the Turks, our masters,&#10;would not allow it. She sang,&#8212;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;On the summit of mount Olympus, in a forest of dwarf&#10;firs, lay an old stag. His eyes were heavy with tears, and&#10;glittering with colors like dewdrops; and there came by a roebuck,&#10;and said, &#39;What ailest thee, that thou weepest blue and red tears?&#39;&#10;And the stag answered, &#39;The Turk has come to our city; he has wild&#10;dogs for the chase, a goodly pack.&#39; &#39;I will drive them away across&#10;the islands!&#39; cried the young roebuck; &#39;I will drive them away&#10;across the islands into the deep sea.&#39; But before evening the&#10;roebuck was slain, and before night the hunted stag was&#10;dead.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And when my mother sang thus, her eyes would become moist;&#10;and on the long eyelashes were tears, but she concealed them and&#10;watched the black bread baking in the ashes. Then I would clench my&#10;fist, and cry, &#34;We will kill these Turks!&#34; But she repeated the&#10;words of the song, &#34;I will drive them across the islands to the&#10;deep sea; but before evening came the roebuck was slain, and before&#10;the night the hunted stag was dead.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;We had been lonely in our hut for several days and nights&#10;when my father came home. I knew he would bring me some shells from&#10;the gulf of Lepanto, or perhaps a knife with a shining blade. This&#10;time he brought, under his sheep-skin cloak, a little child, a&#10;little half-naked girl. She was wrapped in a fur; but when this was&#10;taken off, and she lay in my mother&#39;s lap, three silver coins were&#10;found fastened in her dark hair; they were all her possessions. My&#10;father told us that the child&#39;s parents had been killed by the&#10;Turks, and he talked so much about them that I dreamed of Turks all&#10;night. He himself had been wounded, and my mother bound up his arm.&#10;It was a deep wound, and the thick sheep-skin cloak was stiff with&#10;congealed blood. The little maiden was to be my sister. How pretty&#10;and bright she looked: even my mother&#39;s eyes were not more gentle&#10;than hers. Anastasia, as she was called, was to be my sister,&#10;because her father had been united to mine by an old custom, which&#10;we still follow. They had sworn brotherhood in their youth, and the&#10;most beautiful and virtuous maiden in the neighborhood was chosen&#10;to perform the act of consecration upon this bond of friendship. So&#10;now this little girl was my sister. She sat in my lap, and I&#10;brought her flowers, and feathers from the birds of the mountain.&#10;We drank together of the waters of Parnassus, and dwelt for many&#10;years beneath the laurel roof of the hut, while, winter after&#10;winter, my mother sang her song of the stag who shed red tears. But&#10;as yet I did not understand that the sorrows of my own countrymen&#10;were mirrored in those tears.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;One day there came to our hut Franks, men from a far&#10;country, whose dress was different to ours. They had tents and beds&#10;with them, carried by horses; and they were accompanied by more&#10;than twenty Turks, all armed with swords and muskets. These Franks&#10;were friends of the Pacha, and had letters from him, commanding an&#10;escort for them. They only came to see our mountain, to ascend&#10;Parnassus amid the snow and clouds, and to look at the strange&#10;black rocks which raised their steep sides near our hut. They could&#10;not find room in the hut, nor endure the smoke that rolled along&#10;the ceiling till it found its way out at the low door; so they&#10;pitched their tents on a small space outside our dwelling. Roasted&#10;lambs and birds were brought forth, and strong, sweet wine, of&#10;which the Turks are forbidden to partake.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;When they departed, I accompanied them for some distance,&#10;carrying my little sister Anastasia, wrapped in a goat-skin, on my&#10;back. One of the Frankish gentlemen made me stand in front of a&#10;rock, and drew us both as we stood there, so that we looked like&#10;one creature. I did not think of it then, but Anastasia and I were&#10;really one. She was always sitting on my lap, or riding in the&#10;goat-skin on my back; and in my dreams she always appeared to&#10;me.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Two nights after this, other men, armed with knives and&#10;muskets, came into our tent. They were Albanians, brave men, my&#10;mother told me. They only stayed a short time. My sister Anastasia&#10;sat on the knee of one of them; and when they were gone, she had&#10;not three, but two silver coins in her hair&#8212;one had disappeared.&#10;They wrapped tobacco in strips of paper, and smoked it; and I&#10;remember they were uncertain as to the road they ought to take. But&#10;they were obliged to go at last, and my father went with them. Soon&#10;after, we heard the sound of firing. The noise continued, and&#10;presently soldiers rushed into our hut, and took my mother and&#10;myself and Anastasia prisoners. They declared that we had&#10;entertained robbers, and that my father had acted as their guide,&#10;and therefore we must now go with them. The corpses of the robbers,&#10;and my father&#39;s corpse, were brought into the hut. I saw my poor&#10;dead father, and cried till I fell asleep. When I awoke, I found&#10;myself in a prison; but the room was not worse than our own in the&#10;hut. They gave me onions and musty wine from a tarred cask; but we&#10;were not accustomed to much better fare at home. How long we were&#10;kept in prison, I do not know; but many days and nights passed by.&#10;We were set free about Easter-time. I carried Anastasia on my back,&#10;and we walked very slowly; for my mother was very weak, and it is a&#10;long way to the sea, to the Gulf of Lepanto.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;On our arrival, we entered a church, in which there were&#10;beautiful pictures in golden frames. They were pictures of angels,&#10;fair and bright; and yet our little Anastasia looked equally&#10;beautiful, as it seemed to me. In the centre of the floor stood a&#10;coffin filled with roses. My mother told me it was the Lord Jesus&#10;Christ who was represented by these roses. Then the priest&#10;announced, &#34;Christ is risen,&#34; and all the people greeted each&#10;other. Each one carried a burning taper in his hand, and one was&#10;given to me, as well as to little Anastasia. The music sounded, and&#10;the people left the church hand-in-hand, with joy and gladness.&#10;Outside, the women were roasting the paschal lamb. We were invited&#10;to partake; and as I sat by the fire, a boy, older than myself, put&#10;his arms round my neck, and kissed me, and said, &#34;Christ is risen.&#34;&#10;And thus it was that for the first time I met&#10;Aphtanides.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;My mother could make fishermen&#39;s nets, for which there was&#10;a great demand here in the bay; and we lived a long time by the&#10;side of the sea, the beautiful sea, that had a taste like tears,&#10;and in its colors reminded me of the stag that wept red tears; for&#10;sometimes its waters were red, and sometimes green or blue.&#10;Aphtanides knew how to manage our boat, and I often sat in it, with&#10;my little Anastasia, while it glided on through the water, swift as&#10;a bird flying through the air. Then, when the sun set, how&#10;beautifully, deeply blue, would be the tint on the mountains, one&#10;rising above the other in the far distance, and the summit of mount&#10;Parnassus rising above them all like a glorious crown. Its top&#10;glittered in the evening rays like molten gold, and it seemed as if&#10;the light came from within it; for long after the sun had sunk&#10;beneath the horizon, the mountain-top would glow in the clear, blue&#10;sky. The white aquatic birds skimmed the surface of the water in&#10;their flight, and all was calm and still as amid the black rocks at&#10;Delphi. I lay on my back in the boat, Anastasia leaned against me,&#10;while the stars above us glittered more brightly than the lamps in&#10;our church. They were the same stars, and in the same position over&#10;me as when I used to sit in front of our hut at Delphi, and I had&#10;almost begun to fancy I was still there, when suddenly there was a&#10;splash in the water&#8212;Anastasia had fallen in; but in a moment&#10;Aphtanides has sprung in after her, and was now holding her up to&#10;me. We dried her clothes as well as we were able, and remained on&#10;the water till they were dry; for we did not wish it to be known&#10;what a fright we had had, nor the danger which our little adopted&#10;sister had incurred, in whose life Aphtanides had now a&#10;part.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The summer came, and the burning heat of the sun tinted&#10;the leaves of the trees with lines of gold. I thought of our cool&#10;mountain-home, and the fresh water that flowed near it; my mother,&#10;too, longed for if, and one evening we wandered towards home. How&#10;peaceful and silent it was as we walked on through the thick, wild&#10;thyme, still fragrant, though the sun had scorched the leaves. Not&#10;a single herdsman did we meet, not a solitary hut did we pass;&#10;everything appeared lonely and deserted&#8212;only a shooting star showed&#10;that in the heavens there was yet life. I know not whether the&#10;clear, blue atmosphere gleamed with its own light, or if the&#10;radiance came from the stars; but we could distinguish quite&#10;plainly the outline of the mountains. My mother lighted a fire, and&#10;roasted some roots she had brought with her, and I and my little&#10;sister slept among the bushes, without fear of the ugly smidraki,&#10;from whose throat issues fire, or of the wolf and the jackal; for&#10;my mother sat by us, and I considered her presence sufficient&#10;protection.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;We reached our old home; but the cottage was in ruins, and&#10;we had to build a new one. With the aid of some neighbors, chiefly&#10;women, the walls were in a few days erected, and very soon covered&#10;with a roof of olive-branches. My mother obtained a living by&#10;making bottle-cases of bark and skins, and I kept the sheep&#10;belonging to the priests, who were sometimes peasants, while I had&#10;for my playfellows Anastasia and the turtles.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Once our beloved Aphtanides paid us a visit. He said he&#10;had been longing to see us so much; and he remained with us two&#10;whole happy days. A month afterwards he came again to wish us&#10;good-bye, and brought with him a large fish for my mother. He told&#10;us he was going in a ship to Corfu and Patras, and could relate a&#10;great many stories, not only about the fishermen who lived near the&#10;gulf of Lepanto, but also of kings and heroes who had once&#10;possessed Greece, just as the Turks possess it now.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;I have seen a bud on a rose-bush gradually, in the course&#10;of a few weeks, unfold its leaves till it became a rose in all its&#10;beauty; and, before I was aware of it, I beheld it blooming in rosy&#10;loveliness. The same thing had happened to Anastasia. Unnoticed by&#10;me, she had gradually become a beautiful maiden, and I was now also&#10;a stout, strong youth. The wolf-skins that covered the bed in which&#10;my mother and Anastasia slept, had been taken from wolves which I&#10;had myself shot.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Years had gone by when, one evening, Aphtanides came in.&#10;He had grown tall and slender as a reed, with strong limbs, and a&#10;dark, brown skin. He kissed us all, and had so much to tell of what&#10;he had seen of the great ocean, of the fortifications at Malta, and&#10;of the marvellous sepulchres of Egypt, that I looked up to him with&#10;a kind of veneration. His stories were as strange as the legends of&#10;the priests of olden times.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;How much you know!&#34; I exclaimed, &#34;and what wonders you&#10;can relate?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I think what you once told me, the finest of all,&#34; he&#10;replied; &#34;you told me of a thing that has never been out of my&#10;thoughts&#8212;of the good old custom of &#39;the bond of friendship,&#39;&#8212;a&#10;custom I should like to follow. Brother, let you and I go to&#10;church, as your father and Anastasia&#39;s father once did. Your sister&#10;Anastasia is the most beautiful and most innocent of maidens, and&#10;she shall consecrate the deed. No people have such grand old&#10;customs as we Greeks.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Anastasia blushed like a young rose, and my mother kissed&#10;Aphtanides.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;At about two miles from our cottage, where the earth on&#10;the hill is sheltered by a few scattered trees, stood the little&#10;church, with a silver lamp hanging before the altar. I put on my&#10;best clothes, and the white tunic fell in graceful folds over my&#10;hips. The red jacket fitted tight and close, the tassel on my Fez&#10;cap was of silver, and in my girdle glittered a knife and my&#10;pistols. Aphtanides was clad in the blue dress worn by the Greek&#10;sailors; on his breast hung a silver medal with the figure of the&#10;Virgin Mary, and his scarf was as costly as those worn by rich&#10;lords. Every one could see that we were about to perform a solemn&#10;ceremony. When we entered the little, unpretending church, the&#10;evening sunlight streamed through the open door on the burning&#10;lamp, and glittered on the golden picture frames. We knelt down&#10;together on the altar steps, and Anastasia drew near and stood&#10;beside us. A long, white garment fell in graceful folds over her&#10;delicate form, and on her white neck and bosom hung a chain&#10;entwined with old and new coins, forming a kind of collar. Her&#10;black hair was fastened into a knot, and confined by a headdress&#10;formed of gold and silver coins which had been found in an ancient&#10;temple. No Greek girl had more beautiful ornaments than these. Her&#10;countenance glowed, and her eyes were like two stars. We all three&#10;offered a silent prayer, and then she said to us, &#34;Will you be&#10;friends in life and in death?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes,&#34; we replied.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Will you each remember to say, whatever may happen, &#39;My&#10;brother is a part of myself; his secret is my secret, my happiness&#10;is his; self-sacrifice, patience, everything belongs to me as they&#10;do to him?&#39;&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And we again answered, &#34;Yes.&#34; Then she joined out hands&#10;and kissed us on the forehead, and we again prayed silently. After&#10;this a priest came through a door near the altar, and blessed us&#10;all three. Then a song was sung by other holy men behind the&#10;altar-screen, and the bond of eternal friendship was confirmed.&#10;When we arose, I saw my mother standing by the church door,&#10;weeping.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;How cheerful everything seemed now in our little cottage&#10;by the Delphian springs! On the evening before his departure,&#10;Aphtanides sat thoughtfully beside me on the slopes of the&#10;mountain. His arm was flung around me, and mine was round his neck.&#10;We spoke of the sorrows of Greece, and of the men of the country&#10;who could be trusted. Every thought of our souls lay clear before&#10;us. Presently I seized his hand: &#34;Aphtanides,&#34; I exclaimed, &#34;there&#10;is one thing still that you must know,&#8212;one thing that till now has&#10;been a secret between myself and Heaven. My whole soul is filled&#10;with love,&#8212;with a love stronger than the love I bear to my mother&#10;and to thee.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And whom do you love?&#34; asked Aphtanides. And his face and&#10;neck grew red as fire.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I love Anastasia,&#34; I replied.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then his hand trembled in mine, and he became pale as a&#10;corpse. I saw it, I understood the cause, and I believe my hand&#10;trembled too. I bent towards him, I kissed his forehead, and&#10;whispered, &#34;I have never spoken of this to her, and perhaps she&#10;does not love me. Brother, think of this; I have seen her daily,&#10;she has grown up beside me, and has become a part of my&#10;soul.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And she shall be thine,&#34; he exclaimed; &#34;thine! I may not&#10;wrong thee, nor will I do so. I also love her, but tomorrow I&#10;depart. In a year we will see each other again, but then you will&#10;be married; shall it not be so? I have a little gold of my own, it&#10;shall be yours. You must and shall take it.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;We wandered silently homeward across the mountains. It was&#10;late in the evening when we reached my mother&#39;s door. Anastasia&#10;held the lamp as we entered; my mother was not there. She looked at&#10;Aphtanides with a sweet but mournful expression on her face.&#10;&#34;To-morrow you are going to leave us,&#34; she said. &#34;I am very&#10;sorry.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Sorry!&#34; he exclaimed, and his voice was troubled with a&#10;grief as deep as my own. I could not speak; but he seized her hand&#10;and said, &#34;Our brother yonder loves you, and is he not dear to you?&#10;His very silence now proves his affection.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Anastasia trembled, and burst into tears. Then I saw no&#10;one, thought of none, but her. I threw my arms round her, and&#10;pressed my lips to hers. As she flung her arms round my neck, the&#10;lamp fell to the ground, and we were in darkness, dark as the heart&#10;of poor Aphtanides.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Before daybreak he rose, kissed us all, and said&#10;&#34;Farewell,&#34; and went away. He had given all his money to my mother&#10;for us. Anastasia was betrothed to me, and in a few days afterwards&#10;she became my wife. &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Girl Who Trod on the Loaf'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;THERE was once a girl who trod on a loaf to avoid soiling&#10;her shoes, and the misfortunes that happened to her in consequence&#10;are well known. Her name was Inge; she was a poor child, but proud&#10;and presuming, and with a bad and cruel disposition. When quite a&#10;little child she would delight in catching flies, and tearing off&#10;their wings, so as to make creeping things of them. When older, she&#10;would take cockchafers and beetles, and stick pins through them.&#10;Then she pushed a green leaf, or a little scrap of paper towards&#10;their feet, and when the poor creatures would seize it and hold it&#10;fast, and turn over and over in their struggles to get free from&#10;the pin, she would say, &#34;The cockchafer is reading; see how he&#10;turns over the leaf.&#34; She grew worse instead of better with years,&#10;and, unfortunately, she was pretty, which caused her to be excused,&#10;when she should have been sharply reproved.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Your headstrong will requires severity to conquer it,&#34;&#10;her mother often said to her. &#34;As a little child you used to&#10;trample on my apron, but one day I fear you will trample on my&#10;heart.&#34; And, alas! this fear was realized.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Inge was taken to the house of some rich people, who lived&#10;at a distance, and who treated her as their own child, and dressed&#10;her so fine that her pride and arrogance increased.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;When she had been there about a year, her patroness said&#10;to her, &#34;You ought to go, for once, and see your parents,&#10;Inge.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;So Inge started to go and visit her parents; but she only&#10;wanted to show herself in her native place, that the people might&#10;see how fine she was. She reached the entrance of the village, and&#10;saw the young laboring men and maidens standing together chatting,&#10;and her own mother amongst them. Inge&#39;s mother was sitting on a&#10;stone to rest, with a fagot of sticks lying before her, which she&#10;had picked up in the wood. Then Inge turned back; she who was so&#10;finely dressed she felt ashamed of her mother, a poorly clad woman,&#10;who picked up wood in the forest. She did not turn back out of pity&#10;for her mother&#39;s poverty, but from pride.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Another half-year went by, and her mistress said, &#34;you&#10;ought to go home again, and visit your parents, Inge, and I will&#10;give you a large wheaten loaf to take to them, they will be glad to&#10;see you, I am sure.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;So Inge put on her best clothes, and her new shoes, drew&#10;her dress up around her, and set out, stepping very carefully, that&#10;she might be clean and neat about the feet, and there was nothing&#10;wrong in doing so. But when she came to the place where the&#10;footpath led across the moor, she found small pools of water, and a&#10;great deal of mud, so she threw the loaf into the mud, and trod&#10;upon it, that she might pass without wetting her feet. But as she&#10;stood with one foot on the loaf and the other lifted up to step&#10;forward, the loaf began to sink under her, lower and lower, till&#10;she disappeared altogether, and only a few bubbles on the surface&#10;of the muddy pool remained to show where she had sunk. And this is&#10;the story.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But where did Inge go? She sank into the ground, and went&#10;down to the Marsh Woman, who is always brewing there.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Marsh Woman is related to the elf maidens, who are&#10;well-known, for songs are sung and pictures painted about them. But&#10;of the Marsh Woman nothing is known, excepting that when a mist&#10;arises from the meadows, in summer time, it is because she is&#10;brewing beneath them. To the Marsh Woman&#39;s brewery Inge sunk down&#10;to a place which no one can endure for long. A heap of mud is a&#10;palace compared with the Marsh Woman&#39;s brewery; and as Inge fell&#10;she shuddered in every limb, and soon became cold and stiff as&#10;marble. Her foot was still fastened to the loaf, which bowed her&#10;down as a golden ear of corn bends the stem.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;An evil spirit soon took possession of Inge, and carried&#10;her to a still worse place, in which she saw crowds of unhappy&#10;people, waiting in a state of agony for the gates of mercy to be&#10;opened to them, and in every heart was a miserable and eternal&#10;feeling of unrest. It would take too much time to describe the&#10;various tortures these people suffered, but Inge&#39;s punishment&#10;consisted in standing there as a statue, with her foot fastened to&#10;the loaf. She could move her eyes about, and see all the misery&#10;around her, but she could not turn her head; and when she saw the&#10;people looking at her she thought they were admiring her pretty&#10;face and fine clothes, for she was still vain and proud. But she&#10;had forgotten how soiled her clothes had become while in the Marsh&#10;Woman&#39;s brewery, and that they were covered with mud; a snake had&#10;also fastened itself in her hair, and hung down her back, while&#10;from each fold in her dress a great toad peeped out and croaked&#10;like an asthmatic poodle. Worse than all was the terrible hunger&#10;that tormented her, and she could not stoop to break off a piece of&#10;the loaf on which she stood. No; her back was too stiff, and her&#10;whole body like a pillar of stone. And then came creeping over her&#10;face and eyes flies without wings; she winked and blinked, but they&#10;could not fly away, for their wings had been pulled off; this,&#10;added to the hunger she felt, was horrible torture.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;If this lasts much longer,&#34; she said, &#34;I shall not be&#10;able to bear it.&#34; But it did last, and she had to bear it, without&#10;being able to help herself.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A tear, followed by many scalding tears, fell upon her&#10;head, and rolled over her face and neck, down to the loaf on which&#10;she stood. Who could be weeping for Inge? She had a mother in the&#10;world still, and the tears of sorrow which a mother sheds for her&#10;child will always find their way to the child&#39;s heart, but they&#10;often increase the torment instead of being a relief. And Inge&#10;could hear all that was said about her in the world she had left,&#10;and every one seemed cruel to her. The sin she had committed in&#10;treading on the loaf was known on earth, for she had been seen by&#10;the cowherd from the hill, when she was crossing the marsh and had&#10;disappeared.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;When her mother wept and exclaimed, &#34;Ah, Inge! what grief&#10;thou hast caused thy mother&#34; she would say, &#34;Oh that I had never&#10;been born! My mother&#39;s tears are useless now.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And then the words of the kind people who had adopted her&#10;came to her ears, when they said, &#34;Inge was a sinful girl, who did&#10;not value the gifts of God, but trampled them under her&#10;feet.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ah,&#34; thought Inge, &#34;they should have punished me, and&#10;driven all my naughty tempers out of me.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A song was made about &#34;The girl who trod on a loaf to keep&#10;her shoes from being soiled,&#34; and this song was sung everywhere.&#10;The story of her sin was also told to the little children, and they&#10;called her &#34;wicked Inge,&#34; and said she was so naughty that she&#10;ought to be punished. Inge heard all this, and her heart became&#10;hardened and full of bitterness.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But one day, while hunger and grief were gnawing in her&#10;hollow frame, she heard a little, innocent child, while listening&#10;to the tale of the vain, haughty Inge, burst into tears and&#10;exclaim, &#34;But will she never come up again?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And she heard the reply, &#34;No, she will never come up&#10;again.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But if she were to say she was sorry, and ask pardon, and&#10;promise never to do so again?&#34; asked the little one.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, then she might come; but she will not beg pardon,&#34;&#10;was the answer.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, I wish she would!&#34; said the child, who was quite&#10;unhappy about it. &#34;I should be so glad. I would give up my doll and&#10;all my playthings, if she could only come here again. Poor Inge! it&#10;is so dreadful for her.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;These pitying words penetrated to Inge&#39;s inmost heart, and&#10;seemed to do her good. It was the first time any one had said,&#10;&#34;Poor Inge!&#34; without saying something about her faults. A little&#10;innocent child was weeping, and praying for mercy for her. It made&#10;her feel quite strange, and she would gladly have wept herself, and&#10;it added to her torment to find she could not do so. And while she&#10;thus suffered in a place where nothing changed, years passed away&#10;on earth, and she heard her name less frequently mentioned. But one&#10;day a sigh reached her ear, and the words, &#34;Inge! Inge! what a&#10;grief thou hast been to me! I said it would be so.&#34; It was the last&#10;sigh of her dying mother.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;After this, Inge heard her kind mistress say, &#34;Ah, poor&#10;Inge! shall I ever see thee again? Perhaps I may, for we know not&#10;what may happen in the future.&#34; But Inge knew right well that her&#10;mistress would never come to that dreadful place.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Time-passed&#8212;a long bitter time&#8212;then Inge heard her name&#10;pronounced once more, and saw what seemed two bright stars shining&#10;above her. They were two gentle eyes closing on earth. Many years&#10;had passed since the little girl had lamented and wept about &#34;poor&#10;Inge.&#34; That child was now an old woman, whom God was taking to&#10;Himself. In the last hour of existence the events of a whole life&#10;often appear before us; and this hour the old woman remembered how,&#10;when a child, she had shed tears over the story of Inge, and she&#10;prayed for her now. As the eyes of the old woman closed to earth,&#10;the eyes of the soul opened upon the hidden things of eternity, and&#10;then she, in whose last thoughts Inge had been so vividly present,&#10;saw how deeply the poor girl had sunk. She burst into tears at the&#10;sight, and in heaven, as she had done when a little child on earth,&#10;she wept and prayed for poor Inge. Her tears and her prayers echoed&#10;through the dark void that surrounded the tormented captive soul,&#10;and the unexpected mercy was obtained for it through an angel&#39;s&#10;tears. As in thought Inge seemed to act over again every sin she&#10;had committed on earth, she trembled, and tears she had never yet&#10;been able to weep rushed to her eyes. It seemed impossible that the&#10;gates of mercy could ever be opened to her; but while she&#10;acknowledged this in deep penitence, a beam of radiant light shot&#10;suddenly into the depths upon her. More powerful than the sunbeam&#10;that dissolves the man of snow which the children have raised, more&#10;quickly than the snowflake melts and becomes a drop of water on the&#10;warm lips of a child, was the stony form of Inge changed, and as a&#10;little bird she soared, with the speed of lightning, upward to the&#10;world of mortals. A bird that felt timid and shy to all things&#10;around it, that seemed to shrink with shame from meeting any living&#10;creature, and hurriedly sought to conceal itself in a dark corner&#10;of an old ruined wall; there it sat cowering and unable to utter a&#10;sound, for it was voiceless. Yet how quickly the little bird&#10;discovered the beauty of everything around it. The sweet, fresh&#10;air; the soft radiance of the moon, as its light spread over the&#10;earth; the fragrance which exhaled from bush and tree, made it feel&#10;happy as it sat there clothed in its fresh, bright plumage. All&#10;creation seemed to speak of beneficence and love. The bird wanted&#10;to give utterance to thoughts that stirred in his breast, as the&#10;cuckoo and the nightingale in the spring, but it could not. Yet in&#10;heaven can be heard the song of praise, even from a worm; and the&#10;notes trembling in the breast of the bird were as audible to Heaven&#10;even as the psalms of David before they had fashioned themselves&#10;into words and song.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Christmas-time drew near, and a peasant who dwelt close by&#10;the old wall stuck up a pole with some ears of corn fastened to the&#10;top, that the birds of heaven might have feast, and rejoice in the&#10;happy, blessed time. And on Christmas morning the sun arose and&#10;shone upon the ears of corn, which were quickly surrounded by a&#10;number of twittering birds. Then, from a hole in the wall, gushed&#10;forth in song the swelling thoughts of the bird as he issued from&#10;his hiding place to perform his first good deed on earth,&#8212;and in&#10;heaven it was well known who that bird was.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The winter was very hard; the ponds were covered with ice,&#10;and there was very little food for either the beasts of the field&#10;or the birds of the air. Our little bird flew away into the public&#10;roads, and found here and there, in the ruts of the sledges, a&#10;grain of corn, and at the halting places some crumbs. Of these he&#10;ate only a few, but he called around him the other birds and the&#10;hungry sparrows, that they too might have food. He flew into the&#10;towns, and looked about, and wherever a kind hand had strewed bread&#10;on the window-sill for the birds, he only ate a single crumb&#10;himself, and gave all the rest to the rest of the other birds. In&#10;the course of the winter the bird had in this way collected many&#10;crumbs and given them to other birds, till they equalled the weight&#10;of the loaf on which Inge had trod to keep her shoes clean; and&#10;when the last bread-crumb had been found and given, the gray wings&#10;of the bird became white, and spread themselves out for&#10;flight.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;See, yonder is a sea-gull!&#34; cried the children, when they&#10;saw the white bird, as it dived into the sea, and rose again into&#10;the clear sunlight, white and glittering. But no one could tell&#10;whither it went then although some declared it flew straight to the&#10;sun. &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Goblin and the Huckster'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;THERE was once a regular student, who lived in a garret,&#10;and had no possessions. And there was also a regular huckster, to&#10;whom the house belonged, and who occupied the ground floor. A&#10;goblin lived with the huckster, because at Christmas he always had&#10;a large dish full of jam, with a great piece of butter in the&#10;middle. The huckster could afford this; and therefore the goblin&#10;remained with the huckster, which was very cunning of&#10;him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;One evening the student came into the shop through the&#10;back door to buy candles and cheese for himself, he had no one to&#10;send, and therefore he came himself; he obtained what he wished,&#10;and then the huckster and his wife nodded good evening to him, and&#10;she was a woman who could do more than merely nod, for she had&#10;usually plenty to say for herself. The student nodded in return as&#10;he turned to leave, then suddenly stopped, and began reading the&#10;piece of paper in which the cheese was wrapped. It was a leaf torn&#10;out of an old book, a book that ought not to have been torn up, for&#10;it was full of poetry.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yonder lies some more of the same sort,&#34; said the&#10;huckster: &#34;I gave an old woman a few coffee berries for it; you&#10;shall have the rest for sixpence, if you will.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Indeed I will,&#34; said the student; &#34;give me the book&#10;instead of the cheese; I can eat my bread and butter without&#10;cheese. It would be a sin to tear up a book like this. You are a&#10;clever man; and a practical man; but you understand no more about&#10;poetry than that cask yonder.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;This was a very rude speech, especially against the cask;&#10;but the huckster and the student both laughed, for it was only said&#10;in fun. But the goblin felt very angry that any man should venture&#10;to say such things to a huckster who was a householder and sold the&#10;best butter. As soon as it was night, and the shop closed, and&#10;every one in bed except the student, the goblin stepped softly into&#10;the bedroom where the huckster&#39;s wife slept, and took away her&#10;tongue, which of course, she did not then want. Whatever object in&#10;the room he placed his tongue upon immediately received voice and&#10;speech, and was able to express its thoughts and feelings as&#10;readily as the lady herself could do. It could only be used by one&#10;object at a time, which was a good thing, as a number speaking at&#10;once would have caused great confusion. The goblin laid the tongue&#10;upon the cask, in which lay a quantity of old&#10;newspapers.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Is it really true,&#34; he asked, that you do not know what&#10;poetry is?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Of course I know,&#34; replied the cask: &#34;poetry is something&#10;that always stand in the corner of a newspaper, and is sometimes&#10;cut out; and I may venture to affirm that I have more of it in me&#10;than the student has, and I am only a poor tub of the&#10;huckster&#39;s.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the goblin placed the tongue on the coffee mill; and&#10;how it did go to be sure! Then he put it on the butter tub and the&#10;cash box, and they all expressed the same opinion as the&#10;waste-paper tub; and a majority must always be&#10;respected.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Now I shall go and tell the student,&#34; said the goblin;&#10;and with these words he went quietly up the back stairs to the&#10;garret where the student lived. He had a candle burning still, and&#10;the goblin peeped through the keyhole and saw that he was reading&#10;in the torn book, which he had brought out of the shop. But how&#10;light the room was! From the book shot forth a ray of light which&#10;grew broad and full, like the stem of a tree, from which bright&#10;rays spread upward and over the student&#39;s head. Each leaf was&#10;fresh, and each flower was like a beautiful female head; some with&#10;dark and sparkling eyes, and others with eyes that were wonderfully&#10;blue and clear. The fruit gleamed like stars, and the room was&#10;filled with sounds of beautiful music. The little goblin had never&#10;imagined, much less seen or heard of, any sight so glorious as&#10;this. He stood still on tiptoe, peeping in, till the light went out&#10;in the garret. The student no doubt had blown out his candle and&#10;gone to bed; but the little goblin remained standing there&#10;nevertheless, and listening to the music which still sounded on,&#10;soft and beautiful, a sweet cradle-song for the student, who had&#10;lain down to rest.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;This is a wonderful place,&#34; said the goblin; &#34;I never&#10;expected such a thing. I should like to stay here with the&#10;student;&#34; and the little man thought it over, for he was a sensible&#10;little spirit. At last he sighed, &#34;but the student has no jam!&#34; So&#10;he went down stairs again into the huckster&#39;s shop, and it was a&#10;good thing he got back when he did, for the cask had almost worn&#10;out the lady&#39;s tongue; he had given a description of all that he&#10;contained on one side, and was just about to turn himself over to&#10;the other side to describe what was there, when the goblin entered&#10;and restored the tongue to the lady. But from that time forward,&#10;the whole shop, from the cash box down to the pinewood logs, formed&#10;their opinions from that of the cask; and they all had such&#10;confidence in him, and treated him with so much respect, that when&#10;the huckster read the criticisms on theatricals and art of an&#10;evening, they fancied it must all come from the cask.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But after what he had seen, the goblin could no longer sit&#10;and listen quietly to the wisdom and understanding down stairs; so,&#10;as soon as the evening light glimmered in the garret, he took&#10;courage, for it seemed to him as if the rays of light were strong&#10;cables, drawing him up, and obliging him to go and peep through the&#10;keyhole; and, while there, a feeling of vastness came over him such&#10;as we experience by the ever-moving sea, when the storm breaks&#10;forth; and it brought tears into his eyes. He did not himself know&#10;why he wept, yet a kind of pleasant feeling mingled with his tears.&#10;&#34;How wonderfully glorious it would be to sit with the student under&#10;such a tree;&#34; but that was out of the question, he must be content&#10;to look through the keyhole, and be thankful for even&#10;that.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;There he stood on the old landing, with the autumn wind&#10;blowing down upon him through the trap-door. It was very cold; but&#10;the little creature did not really feel it, till the light in the&#10;garret went out, and the tones of music died away. Then how he&#10;shivered, and crept down stairs again to his warm corner, where it&#10;felt home-like and comfortable. And when Christmas came again, and&#10;brought the dish of jam and the great lump of butter, he liked the&#10;huckster best of all.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Soon after, in the middle of the night, the goblin was&#10;awoke by a terrible noise and knocking against the window shutters&#10;and the house doors, and by the sound of the watchman&#39;s horn; for a&#10;great fire had broken out, and the whole street appeared full of&#10;flames. Was it in their house, or a neighbor&#39;s? No one could tell,&#10;for terror had seized upon all. The huckster&#39;s wife was so&#10;bewildered that she took her gold ear-rings out of her ears and put&#10;them in her pocket, that she might save something at least. The&#10;huckster ran to get his business papers, and the servant resolved&#10;to save her blue silk mantle, which she had managed to buy. Each&#10;wished to keep the best things they had. The goblin had the same&#10;wish; for, with one spring, he was up stairs and in the student&#39;s&#10;room, whom he found standing by the open window, and looking quite&#10;calmly at the fire, which was raging at the house of a neighbor&#10;opposite. The goblin caught up the wonderful book which lay on the&#10;table, and popped it into his red cap, which he held tightly with&#10;both hands. The greatest treasure in the house was saved; and he&#10;ran away with it to the roof, and seated himself on the chimney.&#10;The flames of the burning house opposite illuminated him as he sat,&#10;both hands pressed tightly over his cap, in which the treasure lay;&#10;and then he found out what feelings really reigned in his heart,&#10;and knew exactly which way they tended. And yet, when the fire was&#10;extinguished, and the goblin again began to reflect, he hesitated,&#10;and said at last, &#34;I must divide myself between the two; I cannot&#10;quite give up the huckster, because of the jam.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And this is a representation of human nature. We are like&#10;the goblin; we all go to visit the huckster &#34;because of the jam.&#34;&#10;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Golden Treasure'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;THE drummer&#39;s wife went into the church. She saw the new&#10;altar with the painted pictures and the carved angels. Those upon&#10;the canvas and in the glory over the altar were just as beautiful&#10;as the carved ones; and they were painted and gilt into the&#10;bargain. Their hair gleamed golden in the sunshine, lovely to&#10;behold; but the real sunshine was more beautiful still. It shone&#10;redder, clearer through the dark trees, when the sun went down. It&#10;was lovely thus to look at the sunshine of heaven. And she looked&#10;at the red sun, and she thought about it so deeply, and thought of&#10;the little one whom the stork was to bring, and the wife of the&#10;drummer was very cheerful, and looked and looked, and wished that&#10;the child might have a gleam of sunshine given to it, so that it&#10;might at least become like one of the shining angels over the&#10;altar.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And when she really had the little child in her arms, and&#10;held it up to its father, then it was like one of the angels in the&#10;church to behold, with hair like gold&#8212;the gleam of the setting sun&#10;was upon it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;My golden treasure, my riches, my sunshine!&#34; said the&#10;mother; and she kissed the shining locks, and it sounded like music&#10;and song in the room of the drummer; and there was joy, and life,&#10;and movement. The drummer beat a roll&#8212;a roll of joy. And the Drum&#10;said&#8212;the Fire-drum, that was beaten when there was a fire in the&#10;town:&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Red hair! the little fellow has red hair! Believe the&#10;drum, and not what your mother says! Rub-a dub, rub-a&#10;dub!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the town repeated what the Fire-drum had&#10;said.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The boy was taken to church, the boy was christened. There&#10;was nothing much to be said about his name; he was called Peter.&#10;The whole town, and the Drum too, called him Peter the drummer&#39;s&#10;boy with the red hair; but his mother kissed his red hair, and&#10;called him her golden treasure.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the hollow way in the clayey bank, many had scratched&#10;their names as a remembrance.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Celebrity is always something!&#34; said the drummer; and so&#10;he scratched his own name there, and his little son&#39;s name&#10;likewise.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the swallows came. They had, on their long journey,&#10;seen more durable characters engraven on rocks, and on the walls of&#10;the temples in Hindostan, mighty deeds of great kings, immortal&#10;names, so old that no one now could read or speak them. Remarkable&#10;celebrity!&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the clayey bank the martens built their nest. They&#10;bored holes in the deep declivity, and the splashing rain and the&#10;thin mist came and crumbled and washed the names away, and the&#10;drummer&#39;s name also, and that of his little son.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Peter&#39;s name will last a full year and a half longer!&#34;&#10;said the father.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Fool!&#34; thought the Fire-drum; but it only said, &#34;Dub,&#10;dub, dub, rub-a-dub!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;He was a boy full of life and gladness, this drummer&#39;s son&#10;with the red hair. He had a lovely voice. He could sing, and he&#10;sang like a bird in the woodland. There was melody, and yet no&#10;melody.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;He must become a chorister boy,&#34; said his mother. &#34;He&#10;shall sing in the church, and stand among the beautiful gilded&#10;angels who are like him!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Fiery cat!&#34; said some of the witty ones of the&#10;town.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Drum heard that from the neighbors&#39; wives.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Don&#39;t go home, Peter,&#34; cried the street boys. &#34;If you&#10;sleep in the garret, there&#39;ll be a fire in the house, and the&#10;fire-drum will have to be beaten.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Look out for the drumsticks,&#34; replied Peter; and, small&#10;as he was, he ran up boldly, and gave the foremost such a punch in&#10;the body with his fist, that the fellow lost his legs and tumbled&#10;over, and the others took their legs off with themselves very&#10;rapidly.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The town musician was very genteel and fine. He was the&#10;son of the royal plate-washer. He was very fond of Peter, and would&#10;sometimes take him to his home; and he gave him a violin, and&#10;taught him to play it. It seemed as if the whole art lay in the&#10;boy&#39;s fingers; and he wanted to be more than a drummer&#8212;he wanted to&#10;become musician to the town.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I&#39;ll be a soldier,&#34; said Peter; for he was still quite a&#10;little lad, and it seemed to him the finest thing in the world to&#10;carry a gun, and to be able to march one, two&#8212;one, two, and to wear&#10;a uniform and a sword.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ah, you learn to long for the drum-skin, drum, dum, dum!&#34;&#10;said the Drum.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, if he could only march his way up to be a general!&#34;&#10;observed his father; &#34;but before he can do that, there must be&#10;war.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Heaven forbid!&#34; said his mother.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;We have nothing to lose,&#34; remarked the father.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, we have my boy,&#34; she retorted.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But suppose he came back a general!&#34; said the&#10;father.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Without arms and legs!&#34; cried the mother. &#34;No, I would&#10;rather keep my golden treasure with me.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Drum, dum, dum!&#34; The Fire-drum and all the other drums&#10;were beating, for war had come. The soldiers all set out, and the&#10;son of the drummer followed them. &#34;Red-head. Golden&#10;treasure!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The mother wept; the father in fancy saw him &#34;famous;&#34; the&#10;town musician was of opinion that he ought not to go to war, but&#10;should stay at home and learn music.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Red-head,&#34; said the soldiers, and little Peter laughed;&#10;but when one of them sometimes said to another, &#34;Foxey,&#34; he would&#10;bite his teeth together and look another way&#8212;into the wide world.&#10;He did not care for the nickname.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The boy was active, pleasant of speech, and good-humored;&#10;that is the best canteen, said his old comrades.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And many a night he had to sleep under the open sky, wet&#10;through with the driving rain or the falling mist; but his good&#10;humor never forsook him. The drum-sticks sounded, &#34;Rub-a-dub, all&#10;up, all up!&#34; Yes, he was certainly born to be a drummer.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The day of battle dawned. The sun had not yet risen, but&#10;the morning was come. The air was cold, the battle was hot; there&#10;was mist in the air, but still more gunpowder-smoke. The bullets&#10;and shells flew over the soldiers&#39; heads, and into their heads&#8212;into&#10;their bodies and limbs; but still they pressed forward. Here or&#10;there one or other of them would sink on his knees, with bleeding&#10;temples and a face as white as chalk. The little drummer still kept&#10;his healthy color; he had suffered no damage; he looked cheerfully&#10;at the dog of the regiment, which was jumping along as merrily as&#10;if the whole thing had been got up for his amusement, and as if the&#10;bullets were only flying about that he might have a game of play&#10;with them.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;March! Forward! March!&#34; This, was the word of command for&#10;the drum. The word had not yet been given to fall back, though they&#10;might have done so, and perhaps there would have been much sense in&#10;it; and now at last the word &#34;Retire&#34; was given; but our little&#10;drummer beat &#34;Forward! march!&#34; for he had understood the command&#10;thus, and the soldiers obeyed the sound of the drum. That was a&#10;good roll, and proved the summons to victory for the men, who had&#10;already begun to give way.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Life and limb were lost in the battle. Bombshells tore&#10;away the flesh in red strips; bombshells lit up into a terrible&#10;glow the strawheaps to which the wounded had dragged themselves, to&#10;lie untended for many hours, perhaps for all the hours they had to&#10;live.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It&#39;s no use thinking of it; and yet one cannot help&#10;thinking of it, even far away in the peaceful town. The drummer and&#10;his wife also thought of it, for Peter was at the war.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Now, I&#39;m tired of these complaints,&#34; said the&#10;Fire-drum.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Again the day of battle dawned; the sun had not yet risen,&#10;but it was morning. The drummer and his wife were asleep. They had&#10;been talking about their son, as, indeed, they did almost every&#10;night, for he was out yonder in God&#39;s hand. And the father dreamt&#10;that the war was over, that the soldiers had returned home, and&#10;that Peter wore a silver cross on his breast. But the mother dreamt&#10;that she had gone into the church, and had seen the painted&#10;pictures and the carved angels with the gilded hair, and her own&#10;dear boy, the golden treasure of her heart, who was standing among&#10;the angels in white robes, singing so sweetly, as surely only the&#10;angels can sing; and that he had soared up with them into the&#10;sunshine, and nodded so kindly at his mother.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;My golden treasure!&#34; she cried out; and she awoke. &#34;Now&#10;the good God has taken him to Himself!&#34; She folded her hands, and&#10;hid her face in the cotton curtains of the bed, and wept. &#34;Where&#10;does he rest now? among the many in the big grave that they have&#10;dug for the dead? Perhaps he&#39;s in the water in the marsh! Nobody&#10;knows his grave; no holy words have been read over it!&#34; And the&#10;Lord&#39;s Prayer went inaudibly over her lips; she bowed her head, and&#10;was so weary that she went to sleep.&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the days went by, in life as in dreams!&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was evening. Over the battle-field a rainbow spread,&#10;which touched the forest and the deep marsh.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It has been said, and is preserved in popular belief, that&#10;where the rainbow touches the earth a treasure lies buried, a&#10;golden treasure; and here there was one. No one but his mother&#10;thought of the little drummer, and therefore she dreamt of&#10;him.&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the days went by, in life as in dreams!&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Not a hair of his head had been hurt, not a golden&#10;hair.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Drum-ma-rum! drum-ma-rum! there he is!&#34; the Drum might&#10;have said, and his mother might have sung, if she had seen or&#10;dreamt it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;With hurrah and song, adorned with green wreaths of&#10;victory, they came home, as the war was at an end, and peace had&#10;been signed. The dog of the regiment sprang on in front with large&#10;bounds, and made the way three times as long for himself as it&#10;really was.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And days and weeks went by, and Peter came into his&#10;parents&#39; room. He was as brown as a wild man, and his eyes were&#10;bright, and his face beamed like sunshine. And his mother held him&#10;in her arms; she kissed his lips, his forehead, and his red hair.&#10;She had her boy back again; he had not a silver cross on his&#10;breast, as his father had dreamt, but he had sound limbs, a thing&#10;the mother had not dreamt. And what a rejoicing was there! They&#10;laughed and they wept; and Peter embraced the old&#10;Fire-drum.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;There stands the old skeleton still!&#34; he said.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the father beat a roll upon it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;One would think that a great fire had broken out here,&#34;&#10;said the Fire-drum. &#34;Bright day! fire in the heart! golden&#10;treasure! skrat! skr-r-at! skr-r-r-r-at!&#34;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And what then? What then!&#8212;Ask the town&#10;musician.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Peter&#39;s far outgrowing the drum,&#34; he said. &#34;Peter will be&#10;greater than I.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And yet he was the son of a royal plate-washer; but all&#10;that he had learned in half a lifetime, Peter learned in half a&#10;year.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;There was something so merry about him, something so truly&#10;kind-hearted. His eyes gleamed, and his hair gleamed too&#8212;there was&#10;no denying that!&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;He ought to have his hair dyed,&#34; said the neighbor&#39;s&#10;wife. &#34;That answered capitally with the policeman&#39;s daughter, and&#10;she got a husband.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But her hair turned as green as duckweed, and was always&#10;having to be colored up.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;She knows how to manage for herself,&#34; said the neighbors,&#10;&#34;and so can Peter. He comes to the most genteel houses, even to the&#10;burgomaster&#39;s where he gives Miss Charlotte piano-forte&#10;lessons.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;He could play! He could play, fresh out of his heart, the&#10;most charming pieces, that had never been put upon music-paper. He&#10;played in the bright nights, and in the dark nights, too. The&#10;neighbors declared it was unbearable, and the Fire-drum was of the&#10;same opinion.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;He played until his thoughts soared up, and burst forth in&#10;great plans for the future:&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;To be famous!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And burgomaster&#39;s Charlotte sat at the piano. Her delicate&#10;fingers danced over the keys, and made them ring into Peter&#39;s&#10;heart. It seemed too much for him to bear; and this happened not&#10;once, but many times; and at last one day he seized the delicate&#10;fingers and the white hand, and kissed it, and looked into her&#10;great brown eyes. Heaven knows what he said; but we may be allowed&#10;to guess at it. Charlotte blushed to guess at it. She reddened from&#10;brow to neck, and answered not a single word; and then strangers&#10;came into the room, and one of them was the state councillor&#39;s son.&#10;He had a lofty white forehead, and carried it so high that it&#10;seemed to go back into his neck. And Peter sat by her a long time,&#10;and she looked at him with gentle eyes.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;At home that evening he spoke of travel in the wide world,&#10;and of the golden treasure that lay hidden for him in his&#10;violin.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;To be famous!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Tum-me-lum, tum-me-lum, tum-me-lum!&#34; said the Fire-drum.&#10;&#34;Peter has gone clear out of his wits. I think there must be a fire&#10;in the house.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Next day the mother went to market.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Shall I tell you news, Peter?&#34; she asked when she came&#10;home. &#34;A capital piece of news. Burgomaster&#39;s Charlotte has engaged&#10;herself to the state councillor&#39;s son; the betrothal took place&#10;yesterday evening.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No!&#34; cried Peter, and he sprang up from his chair. But&#10;his mother persisted in saying &#34;Yes.&#34; She had heard it from the&#10;baker&#39;s wife, whose husband had it from the burgomaster&#39;s own&#10;mouth&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And Peter became as pale as death, and sat down&#10;again.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Good Heaven! what&#39;s the matter with you?&#34; asked his&#10;mother.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Nothing, nothing; only leave me to myself,&#34; he answered&#10;but the tears were running down his cheeks.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;My sweet child, my golden treasure!&#34; cried the mother,&#10;and she wept; but the Fire-drum sang, not out loud, but&#10;inwardly.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Charlotte&#39;s gone! Charlotte&#39;s gone! and now the song is&#10;done.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But the song was not done; there were many more verses in&#10;it, long verses, the most beautiful verses, the golden treasures of&#10;a life.&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;She behaves like a mad woman,&#34; said the neighbor&#39;s wife.&#10;&#34;All the world is to see the letters she gets from her golden&#10;treasure, and to read the words that are written in the papers&#10;about his violin playing. And he sends her money too, and that&#39;s&#10;very useful to her since she has been a widow.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;He plays before emperors and kings,&#34; said the town&#10;musician. &#34;I never had that fortune, but he&#39;s my pupil, and he does&#10;not forget his old master.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And his mother said,&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;His father dreamt that Peter came home from the war with&#10;a silver cross. He did not gain one in the war, but it is still&#10;more difficult to gain one in this way. Now he has the cross of&#10;honor. If his father had only lived to see it!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;He&#39;s grown famous!&#34; said the Fire-drum, and all his&#10;native town said the same thing, for the drummer&#39;s son, Peter with&#10;the red hair&#8212;Peter whom they had known as a little boy, running&#10;about in wooden shoes, and then as a drummer, playing for the&#10;dancers&#8212;was become famous!&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;He played at our house before he played in the presence&#10;of kings,&#34; said the burgomaster&#39;s wife. &#34;At that time he was quite&#10;smitten with Charlotte. He was always of an aspiring turn. At that&#10;time he was saucy and an enthusiast. My husband laughed when he&#10;heard of the foolish affair, and now our Charlotte is a state&#10;councillor&#39;s wife.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A golden treasure had been hidden in the heart and soul of&#10;the poor child, who had beaten the roll as a drummer&#8212;a roll of&#10;victory for those who had been ready to retreat. There was a golden&#10;treasure in his bosom, the power of sound; it burst forth on his&#10;violin as if the instrument had been a complete organ, and as if&#10;all the elves of a midsummer night were dancing across the strings.&#10;In its sounds were heard the piping of the thrush and the full&#10;clear note of the human voice; therefore the sound brought rapture&#10;to every heart, and carried his name triumphant through the land.&#10;That was a great firebrand&#8212;the firebrand of inspiration.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And then he looks so splendid!&#34; said the young ladies and&#10;the old ladies too; and the oldest of all procured an album for&#10;famous locks of hair, wholly and solely that she might beg a lock&#10;of his rich splendid hair, that treasure, that golden&#10;treasure.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the son came into the poor room of the drummer,&#10;elegant as a prince, happier than a king. His eyes were as clear&#10;and his face was as radiant as sunshine; and he held his mother in&#10;his arms, and she kissed his mouth, and wept as blissfully as any&#10;one can weep for joy; and he nodded at every old piece of furniture&#10;in the room, at the cupboard with the tea-cups, and at the&#10;flower-vase. He nodded at the sleeping-bench, where he had slept as&#10;a little boy; but the old Fire-drum he brought out, and dragged it&#10;into the middle of the room, and said to it and to his&#10;mother:&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;My father would have beaten a famous roll this evening.&#10;Now I must do it!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And he beat a thundering roll-call on the instrument, and&#10;the Drum felt so highly honored that the parchment burst with&#10;exultation.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;He has a splendid touch!&#34; said the Drum. &#34;I&#39;ve a&#10;remembrance of him now that will last. I expect that the same thing&#10;will happen to his mother, from pure joy over her golden&#10;treasure.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And this is the story of the Golden Treasure.&#10;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)

He looked smart, for&#10;his shirt-frill, in which he had stuck a breast-pin, and his&#10;ruffles, were very fine. He had shaved his chin uncommonly smooth,&#10;although he had cut himself slightly, and had stuck a piece of&#10;newspaper over the place. &#34;Hark &#39;ee, youngster!&#34; cried&#10;he.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The boy to whom he spoke was no other than the son of a&#10;poor washer-woman, who was just going past the house. He stopped,&#10;and respectfully took off his cap. The peak of this cap was broken&#10;in the middle, so that he could easily roll it up and put it in his&#10;pocket. He stood before the mayor in his poor but clean and&#10;well-mended clothes, with heavy wooden shoes on his feet, looking&#10;as humble as if it had been the king himself.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You are a good and civil boy,&#34; said the mayor. &#34;I suppose&#10;your mother is busy washing the clothes down by the river, and you&#10;are going to carry that thing to her that you have in your pocket.&#10;It is very bad for your mother. How much have you got in&#10;it?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Only half a quartern,&#34; stammered the boy in a frightened&#10;voice.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And she has had just as much this morning&#10;already?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No, it was yesterday,&#34; replied the boy.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Two halves make a whole,&#34; said the mayor. &#34;She&#39;s good for&#10;nothing. What a sad thing it is with these people. Tell your mother&#10;she ought to be ashamed of herself. Don&#39;t you become a drunkard,&#10;but I expect you will though. Poor child! there, go&#10;now.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The boy went on his way with his cap in his hand, while&#10;the wind fluttered his golden hair till the locks stood up&#10;straight. He turned round the corner of the street into the little&#10;lane that led to the river, where his mother stood in the water by&#10;her washing bench, beating the linen with a heavy wooden bar. The&#10;floodgates at the mill had been drawn up, and as the water rolled&#10;rapidly on, the sheets were dragged along by the stream, and nearly&#10;overturned the bench, so that the washer-woman was obliged to lean&#10;against it to keep it steady. &#34;I have been very nearly carried&#10;away,&#34; she said; &#34;it is a good thing that you are come, for I want&#10;something to strengthen me. It is cold in the water, and I have&#10;stood here six hours. Have you brought anything for me?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The boy drew the bottle from his pocket, and the mother&#10;put it to her lips, and drank a little.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ah, how much good that does, and how it warms me,&#34; she&#10;said; &#34;it is as good as a hot meal, and not so dear. Drink a&#10;little, my boy; you look quite pale; you are shivering in your thin&#10;clothes, and autumn has really come. Oh, how cold the water is! I&#10;hope I shall not be ill. But no, I must not be afraid of that. Give&#10;me a little more, and you may have a sip too, but only a sip; you&#10;must not get used to it, my poor, dear child.&#34; She stepped up to&#10;the bridge on which the boy stood as she spoke, and came on shore.&#10;The water dripped from the straw mat which she had bound round her&#10;body, and from her gown. &#34;I work hard and suffer pain with my poor&#10;hands,&#34; said she, &#34;but I do it willingly, that I may be able to&#10;bring you up honestly and truthfully, my dear boy.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;At the same moment, a woman, rather older than herself,&#10;came towards them. She was a miserable-looking object, lame of one&#10;leg, and with a large false curl hanging down over one of her eyes,&#10;which was blind. This curl was intended to conceal the blind eye,&#10;but it made the defect only more visible. She was a friend of the&#10;laundress, and was called, among the neighbors, &#34;Lame Martha, with&#10;the curl.&#34; &#34;Oh, you poor thing; how you do work, standing there in&#10;the water!&#34; she exclaimed. &#34;You really do need something to give&#10;you a little warmth, and yet spiteful people cry out about the few&#10;drops you take.&#34; And then Martha repeated to the laundress, in a&#10;very few minutes, all that the mayor had said to her boy, which she&#10;had overheard; and she felt very angry that any man could speak, as&#10;he had done, of a mother to her own child, about the few drops she&#10;had taken; and she was still more angry because, on that very day,&#10;the mayor was going to have a dinner-party, at which there would be&#10;wine, strong, rich wine, drunk by the bottle. &#34;Many will take more&#10;than they ought, but they don&#39;t call that drinking! They are all&#10;right, you are good for nothing indeed!&#34; cried Martha&#10;indignantly.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And so he spoke to you in that way, did he, my child?&#34;&#10;said the washer-woman, and her lips trembled as she spoke. &#34;He says&#10;you have a mother who is good for nothing. Well, perhaps he is&#10;right, but he should not have said it to my child. How much has&#10;happened to me from that house!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes,&#34; said Martha; &#34;I remember you were in service there,&#10;and lived in the house when the mayor&#39;s parents were alive; how&#10;many years ago that is. Bushels of salt have been eaten since then,&#10;and people may well be thirsty,&#34; and Martha smiled. &#34;The mayor&#39;s&#10;great dinner-party to-day ought to have been put off, but the news&#10;came too late. The footman told me the dinner was already cooked,&#10;when a letter came to say that the mayor&#39;s younger brother in&#10;Copenhagen is dead.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Dead!&#34; cried the laundress, turning pale as&#10;death.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, certainly,&#34; replied Martha; &#34;but why do you take it&#10;so much to heart? I suppose you knew him years ago, when you were&#10;in service there?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Is he dead?&#34; she exclaimed. &#34;Oh, he was such a kind,&#10;good-hearted man, there are not many like him,&#34; and the tears&#10;rolled down her cheeks as she spoke. Then she cried, &#34;Oh, dear me;&#10;I feel quite ill: everything is going round me, I cannot bear it.&#10;Is the bottle empty?&#34; and she leaned against the plank.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Dear me, you are ill indeed,&#34; said the other woman.&#10;&#34;Come, cheer up; perhaps it will pass off. No, indeed, I see you&#10;are really ill; the best thing for me to do is to lead you&#10;home.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But my washing yonder?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I will take care of that. Come, give me your arm. The boy&#10;can stay here and take care of the linen, and I&#39;ll come back and&#10;finish the washing; it is but a trifle.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The limbs of the laundress shook under her, and she said,&#10;&#34;I have stood too long in the cold water, and I have had nothing to&#10;eat the whole day since the morning. O kind Heaven, help me to get&#10;home; I am in a burning fever. Oh, my poor child,&#34; and she burst&#10;into tears. And he, poor boy, wept also, as he sat alone by the&#10;river, near to and watching the damp linen.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The two women walked very slowly. The laundress slipped&#10;and tottered through the lane, and round the corner, into the&#10;street where the mayor lived; and just as she reached the front of&#10;his house, she sank down upon the pavement. Many persons came round&#10;her, and Lame Martha ran into the house for help. The mayor and his&#10;guests came to the window.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, it is the laundress,&#34; said he; &#34;she has had a little&#10;drop too much. She is good for nothing. It is a sad thing for her&#10;pretty little son. I like the boy very well; but the mother is good&#10;for nothing.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;After a while the laundress recovered herself, and they&#10;led her to her poor dwelling, and put her to bed. Kind Martha&#10;warmed a mug of beer for her, with butter and sugar&#8212;she considered&#10;this the best medicine&#8212;and then hastened to the river, washed and&#10;rinsed, badly enough, to be sure, but she did her best. Then she&#10;drew the linen ashore, wet as it was, and laid it in a basket.&#10;Before evening, she was sitting in the poor little room with the&#10;laundress. The mayor&#39;s cook had given her some roasted potatoes and&#10;a beautiful piece of fat for the sick woman. Martha and the boy&#10;enjoyed these good things very much; but the sick woman could only&#10;say that the smell was very nourishing, she thought. By-and-by the&#10;boy was put to bed, in the same bed as the one in which his mother&#10;lay; but he slept at her feet, covered with an old quilt made of&#10;blue and white patchwork. The laundress felt a little better by&#10;this time. The warm beer had strengthened her, and the smell of the&#10;good food had been pleasant to her.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Many thanks, you good soul,&#34; she said to Martha. &#34;Now the&#10;boy is asleep, I will tell you all. He is soon asleep. How gentle&#10;and sweet he looks as he lies there with his eyes closed! He does&#10;not know how his mother has suffered; and Heaven grant he never may&#10;know it. I was in service at the counsellor&#39;s, the father of the&#10;mayor, and it happened that the youngest of his sons, the student,&#10;came home. I was a young wild girl then, but honest; that I can&#10;declare in the sight of Heaven. The student was merry and gay,&#10;brave and affectionate; every drop of blood in him was good and&#10;honorable; a better man never lived on earth. He was the son of the&#10;house, and I was only a maid; but he loved me truly and honorably,&#10;and he told his mother of it. She was to him as an angel upon&#10;earth; she was so wise and loving. He went to travel, and before he&#10;started he placed a gold ring on my finger; and as soon as he was&#10;out of the house, my mistress sent for me. Gently and earnestly she&#10;drew me to her, and spake as if an angel were speaking. She showed&#10;me clearly, in spirit and in truth, the difference there was&#10;between him and me. &#39;He is pleased now,&#39; she said, &#39;with your&#10;pretty face; but good looks do not last long. You have not been&#10;educated like he has. You are not equals in mind and rank, and&#10;therein lies the misfortune. I esteem the poor,&#39; she added. &#39;In the&#10;sight of God, they may occupy a higher place than many of the rich;&#10;but here upon earth we must beware of entering upon a false track,&#10;lest we are overturned in our plans, like a carriage that travels&#10;by a dangerous road. I know a worthy man, an artisan, who wishes to&#10;marry you. I mean Eric, the glovemaker. He is a widower, without&#10;children, and in a good position. Will you think it over?&#39; Every&#10;word she said pierced my heart like a knife; but I knew she was&#10;right, and the thought pressed heavily upon me. I kissed her hand,&#10;and wept bitter tears, and I wept still more when I went to my&#10;room, and threw myself on the bed. I passed through a dreadful&#10;night; God knows what I suffered, and how I struggled. The&#10;following Sunday I went to the house of God to pray for light to&#10;direct my path. It seemed like a providence that as I stepped out&#10;of church Eric came towards me; and then there remained not a doubt&#10;in my mind. We were suited to each other in rank and circumstances.&#10;He was, even then, a man of good means. I went up to him, and took&#10;his hand, and said, &#39;Do you still feel the same for me?&#39; &#39;Yes; ever&#10;and always,&#39; said he. &#39;Will you, then, marry a maiden who honors&#10;and esteems you, although she cannot offer you her love? but that&#10;may come.&#39; &#39;Yes, it will come,&#39; said he; and we joined our hands&#10;together, and I went home to my mistress. The gold ring which her&#10;son had given me I wore next to my heart. I could not place it on&#10;my finger during the daytime, but only in the evening, when I went&#10;to bed. I kissed the ring till my lips almost bled, and then I gave&#10;it to my mistress, and told her that the banns were to be put up&#10;for me and the glovemaker the following week. Then my mistress&#10;threw her arms round me, and kissed me. She did not say that I was&#10;&#39;good for nothing;&#39; very likely I was better then than I am now;&#10;but the misfortunes of this world, were unknown to me then. At&#10;Michaelmas we were married, and for the first year everything went&#10;well with us. We had a journeyman and an apprentice, and you were&#10;our servant, Martha.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ah, yes, and you were a dear, good mistress,&#34; said&#10;Martha, &#34;I shall never forget how kind you and your husband were to&#10;me.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, those were happy years when you were with us,&#10;although we had no children at first. The student I never met&#10;again. Yet I saw him once, although he did not see me. He came to&#10;his mother&#39;s funeral. I saw him, looking pale as death, and deeply&#10;troubled, standing at her grave; for she was his mother. Sometime&#10;after, when his father died, he was in foreign lands, and did not&#10;come home. I know that he never married, I believe he became a&#10;lawyer. He had forgotten me, and even had we met he would not have&#10;known me, for I have lost all my good looks, and perhaps that is&#10;all for the best.&#34; And then she spoke of the dark days of trial,&#10;when misfortune had fallen upon them.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;We had five hundred dollars,&#34; she said, &#34;and there was a&#10;house in the street to be sold for two hundred, so we thought it&#10;would be worth our while to pull it down and build a new one in its&#10;place; so it was bought. The builder and carpenter made an estimate&#10;that the new house would cost ten hundred and twenty dollars to&#10;build. Eric had credit, so he borrowed the money in the chief town.&#10;But the captain, who was bringing it to him, was shipwrecked, and&#10;the money lost. Just about this time, my dear sweet boy, who lies&#10;sleeping there, was born, and my husband was attacked with a severe&#10;lingering illness. For three quarters of a year I was obliged to&#10;dress and undress him. We were backward in our payments, we&#10;borrowed more money, and all that we had was lost and sold, and&#10;then my husband died. Since then I have worked, toiled, and striven&#10;for the sake of the child. I have scrubbed and washed both coarse&#10;and fine linen, but I have not been able to make myself better off;&#10;and it was God&#39;s will. In His own time He will take me to Himself,&#10;but I know He will never forsake my boy.&#34; Then she fell asleep. In&#10;the morning she felt much refreshed, and strong enough, as she&#10;thought, to go on with her work. But as soon as she stepped into&#10;the cold water, a sudden faintness seized her; she clutched at the&#10;air convulsively with her hand, took one step forward, and fell.&#10;Her head rested on dry land, but her feet were in the water; her&#10;wooden shoes, which were only tied on by a wisp of straw, were&#10;carried away by the stream, and thus she was found by Martha when&#10;she came to bring her some coffee.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the meantime a messenger had been sent to her house by&#10;the mayor, to say that she must come to him immediately, as he had&#10;something to tell her. It was too late; a surgeon had been sent for&#10;to open a vein in her arm, but the poor woman was dead.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;She has drunk herself to death,&#34; said the cruel mayor. In&#10;the letter, containing the news of his brother&#39;s death, it was&#10;stated that he had left in his will a legacy of six hundred dollars&#10;to the glovemaker&#39;s widow, who had been his mother&#39;s maid, to be&#10;paid with discretion, in large or small sums to the widow or her&#10;child.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;There was something between my brother and her, I&#10;remember,&#34; said the mayor; &#34;it is a good thing that she is out of&#10;the way, for now the boy will have the whole. I will place him with&#10;honest people to bring him up, that he may become a respectable&#10;working man.&#34; And the blessing of God rested upon these words. The&#10;mayor sent for the boy to come to him, and promised to take care of&#10;him, but most cruelly added that it was a good thing that his&#10;mother was dead, for &#34;she was good for nothing.&#34; They carried her&#10;to the churchyard, the churchyard in which the poor were buried.&#10;Martha strewed sand on the grave and planted a rose-tree upon it,&#10;and the boy stood by her side.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, my poor mother!&#34; he cried, while the tears rolled&#10;down his cheeks. &#34;Is it true what they say, that she was good for&#10;nothing?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No, indeed, it is not true,&#34; replied the old servant,&#10;raising her eyes to heaven; &#34;she was worth a great deal; I knew it&#10;years ago, and since the last night of her life I am more certain&#10;of it than ever. I say she was a good and worthy woman, and God,&#10;who is in heaven, knows I am speaking the truth, though the world&#10;may say, even now she was good for nothing.&#34; &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;Grandmother'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;GRANDMOTHER is very old, her face is wrinkled, and her&#10;hair is quite white; but her eyes are like two stars, and they have&#10;a mild, gentle expression in them when they look at you, which does&#10;you good. She wears a dress of heavy, rich silk, with large flowers&#10;worked on it; and it rustles when she moves. And then she can tell&#10;the most wonderful stories. Grandmother knows a great deal, for she&#10;was alive before father and mother&#8212;that&#39;s quite certain. She has a&#10;hymn-book with large silver clasps, in which she often reads; and&#10;in the book, between the leaves, lies a rose, quite flat and dry;&#10;it is not so pretty as the roses which are standing in the glass,&#10;and yet she smiles at it most pleasantly, and tears even come into&#10;her eyes. &#34;I wonder why grandmother looks at the withered flower in&#10;the old book that way? Do you know?&#34; Why, when grandmother&#39;s tears&#10;fall upon the rose, and she is looking at it, the rose revives, and&#10;fills the room with its fragrance; the walls vanish as in a mist,&#10;and all around her is the glorious green wood, where in summer the&#10;sunlight streams through thick foliage; and grandmother, why she is&#10;young again, a charming maiden, fresh as a rose, with round, rosy&#10;cheeks, fair, bright ringlets, and a figure pretty and graceful;&#10;but the eyes, those mild, saintly eyes, are the same,&#8212;they have&#10;been left to grandmother. At her side sits a young man, tall and&#10;strong; he gives her a rose and she smiles. Grandmother cannot&#10;smile like that now. Yes, she is smiling at the memory of that day,&#10;and many thoughts and recollections of the past; but the handsome&#10;young man is gone, and the rose has withered in the old book, and&#10;grandmother is sitting there, again an old woman, looking down upon&#10;the withered rose in the book.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Grandmother is dead now. She had been sitting in her&#10;arm-chair, telling us a long, beautiful tale; and when it was&#10;finished, she said she was tired, and leaned her head back to sleep&#10;awhile. We could hear her gentle breathing as she slept; gradually&#10;it became quieter and calmer, and on her countenance beamed&#10;happiness and peace. It was as if lighted up with a ray of&#10;sunshine. She smiled once more, and then people said she was dead.&#10;She was laid in a black coffin, looking mild and beautiful in the&#10;white folds of the shrouded linen, though her eyes were closed; but&#10;every wrinkle had vanished, her hair looked white and silvery, and&#10;around her mouth lingered a sweet smile. We did not feel at all&#10;afraid to look at the corpse of her who had been such a dear, good&#10;grandmother. The hymn-book, in which the rose still lay, was placed&#10;under her head, for so she had wished it; and then they buried&#10;grandmother.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;On the grave, close by the churchyard wall, they planted a&#10;rose-tree; it was soon full of roses, and the nightingale sat among&#10;the flowers, and sang over the grave. From the organ in the church&#10;sounded the music and the words of the beautiful psalms, which were&#10;written in the old book under the head of the dead one.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The moon shone down upon the grave, but the dead was not&#10;there; every child could go safely, even at night, and pluck a rose&#10;from the tree by the churchyard wall. The dead know more than we do&#10;who are living. They know what a terror would come upon us if such&#10;a strange thing were to happen, as the appearance of a dead person&#10;among us. They are better off than we are; the dead return no more.&#10;The earth has been heaped on the coffin, and it is earth only that&#10;lies within it. The leaves of the hymn-book are dust; and the rose,&#10;with all its recollections, has crumbled to dust also. But over the&#10;grave fresh roses bloom, the nightingale sings, and the organ&#10;sounds and there still lives a remembrance of old grandmother, with&#10;the loving, gentle eyes that always looked young. Eyes can never&#10;die. Ours will once again behold dear grandmother, young and&#10;beautiful as when, for the first time, she kissed the fresh, red&#10;rose, that is now dust in the grave. &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)

The first part&#10;might be left out, but it gives us a few particulars, and these are&#10;useful&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;We were staying in the country at a gentleman&#39;s seat,&#10;where it happened that the master was absent for a few days. In the&#10;meantime, there arrived from the next town a lady; she had a pug&#10;dog with her, and came, she said, to dispose of shares in her&#10;tan-yard. She had her papers with her, and we advised her to put&#10;them in an envelope, and to write thereon the address of the&#10;proprietor of the estate, &#34;General War-Commissary Knight,&#34;&#10;&#38;amp;c.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;She listened to us attentively, seized the pen, paused,&#10;and begged us to repeat the direction slowly. We complied, and she&#10;wrote; but in the midst of the &#34;General War-&#34; she struck fast,&#10;sighed deeply, and said, &#34;I am only a woman!&#34; Her Puggie had seated&#10;itself on the ground while she wrote, and growled; for the dog had&#10;come with her for amusement and for the sake of its health; and&#10;then the bare floor ought not to be offered to a visitor. His&#10;outward appearance was characterized by a snub nose and a very fat&#10;back.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;He doesn&#39;t bite,&#34; said the lady; &#34;he has no teeth. He is&#10;like one of the family, faithful and grumpy; but the latter is my&#10;grandchildren&#39;s fault, for they have teased him; they play at&#10;wedding, and want to give him the part of the bridesmaid, and&#10;that&#39;s too much for him, poor old fellow.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And she delivered her papers, and took Puggie upon her&#10;arm. And this is the first part of the story which might have been&#10;left out.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;PUGGIE DIED!! That&#39;s the second part.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was about a week afterwards we arrived in the town, and&#10;put up at the inn. Our windows looked into the tan-yard, which was&#10;divided into two parts by a partition of planks; in one half were&#10;many skins and hides, raw and tanned. Here was all the apparatus&#10;necessary to carry on a tannery, and it belonged to the widow.&#10;Puggie had died in the morning, and was to be buried in this part&#10;of the yard; the grandchildren of the widow (that is, of the&#10;tanner&#39;s widow, for Puggie had never been married) filled up the&#10;grave, and it was a beautiful grave&#8212;it must have been quite&#10;pleasant to lie there.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The grave was bordered with pieces of flower-pots and&#10;strewn over with sand; quite at the top they had stuck up half a&#10;beer bottle, with the neck upwards, and that was not at all&#10;allegorical.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The children danced round the grave, and the eldest of the&#10;boys among them, a practical youngster of seven years, made the&#10;proposition that there should be an exhibition of Puggie&#39;s&#10;burial-place for all who lived in the lane; the price of admission&#10;was to be a trouser button, for every boy would be sure to have&#10;one, and each might also give one for a little girl. This proposal&#10;was adopted by acclamation.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And all the children out of the lane&#8212;yes, even out of the&#10;little lane at the back&#8212;flocked to the place, and each gave a&#10;button. Many were noticed to go about on that afternoon with only&#10;one suspender; but then they had seen Puggie&#39;s grave, and the sight&#10;was worth much more.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But in front of the tan-yard, close to the entrance, stood&#10;a little girl clothed in rags, very pretty to look at, with curly&#10;hair, and eyes so blue and clear that it was a pleasure to look&#10;into them. The child said not a word, nor did she cry; but each&#10;time the little door was opened she gave a long, long look into the&#10;yard. She had not a button&#8212;that she knew right well, and therefore&#10;she remained standing sorrowfully outside, till all the others had&#10;seen the grave and had gone away; then she sat down, held her&#10;little brown hands before her eyes, and burst into tears; this girl&#10;alone had not seen Puggie&#39;s grave. It was a grief as great to her&#10;as any grown person can experience.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;We saw this from above; and looked at from above, how many&#10;a grief of our own and of others can make us smile! That is the&#10;story, and whoever does not understand it may go and purchase a&#10;share in the tan-yard from the window. &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Happy Family'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;THE largest green leaf in this country is certainly the&#10;burdock-leaf. If you hold it in front of you, it is large enough&#10;for an apron; and if you hold it over your head, it is almost as&#10;good as an umbrella, it is so wonderfully large. A burdock never&#10;grows alone; where it grows, there are many more, and it is a&#10;splendid sight; and all this splendor is good for snails. The great&#10;white snails, which grand people in olden times used to have made&#10;into fricassees; and when they had eaten them, they would say, &#34;O,&#10;what a delicious dish!&#34; for these people really thought them good;&#10;and these snails lived on burdock-leaves, and for them the burdock&#10;was planted.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;There was once an old estate where no one now lived to&#10;require snails; indeed, the owners had all died out, but the&#10;burdock still flourished; it grew over all the beds and walks of&#10;the garden&#8212;its growth had no check&#8212;till it became at last quite a&#10;forest of burdocks. Here and there stood an apple or a plum-tree;&#10;but for this, nobody would have thought the place had ever been a&#10;garden. It was burdock from one end to the other; and here lived&#10;the last two surviving snails. They knew not themselves how old&#10;they were; but they could remember the time when there were a great&#10;many more of them, and that they were descended from a family which&#10;came from foreign lands, and that the whole forest had been planted&#10;for them and theirs. They had never been away from the garden; but&#10;they knew that another place once existed in the world, called the&#10;Duke&#39;s Palace Castle, in which some of their relations had been&#10;boiled till they became black, and were then laid on a silver dish;&#10;but what was done afterwards they did not know. Besides, they could&#10;not imagine exactly how it felt to be boiled and placed on a silver&#10;dish; but no doubt it was something very fine and highly genteel.&#10;Neither the cockchafer, nor the toad, nor the earth-worm, whom they&#10;questioned about it, would give them the least information; for&#10;none of their relations had ever been cooked or served on a silver&#10;dish. The old white snails were the most aristocratic race in the&#10;world,&#8212;they knew that. The forest had been planted for them, and&#10;the nobleman&#39;s castle had been built entirely that they might be&#10;cooked and laid on silver dishes.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;They lived quite retired and very happily; and as they had&#10;no children of their own, they had adopted a little common snail,&#10;which they brought up as their own child. The little one would not&#10;grow, for he was only a common snail; but the old people,&#10;particularly the mother-snail, declared that she could easily see&#10;how he grew; and when the father said he could not perceive it, she&#10;begged him to feel the little snail&#39;s shell, and he did so, and&#10;found that the mother was right.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;One day it rained very fast. &#34;Listen, what a drumming&#10;there is on the burdock-leaves; turn, turn, turn; turn, turn,&#10;turn,&#34; said the father-snail.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;There come the drops,&#34; said the mother; &#34;they are&#10;trickling down the stalks. We shall have it very wet here&#10;presently. I am very glad we have such good houses, and that the&#10;little one has one of his own. There has been really more done for&#10;us than for any other creature; it is quite plain that we are the&#10;most noble people in the world. We have houses from our birth, and&#10;the burdock forest has been planted for us. I should very much like&#10;to know how far it extends, and what lies beyond it.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;There can be nothing better than we have here,&#34; said the&#10;father-snail; &#34;I wish for nothing more.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, but I do,&#34; said the mother; &#34;I should like to be&#10;taken to the palace, and boiled, and laid upon a silver dish, as&#10;was done to all our ancestors; and you may be sure it must be&#10;something very uncommon.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The nobleman&#39;s castle, perhaps, has fallen to decay,&#34;&#10;said the snail-father, or the burdock wood may have grown out. You&#10;need not be in a hurry; you are always so impatient, and the&#10;youngster is getting just the same. He has been three days creeping&#10;to the top of that stalk. I feel quite giddy when I look at&#10;him.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You must not scold him,&#34; said the mother-snail; &#34;he&#10;creeps so very carefully. He will be the joy of our home; and we&#10;old folks have nothing else to live for. But have you ever thought&#10;where we are to get a wife for him? Do you think that farther out&#10;in the wood there may be others of our race?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;There may be black snails, no doubt,&#34; said the old snail;&#10;&#34;black snails without houses; but they are so vulgar and conceited&#10;too. But we can give the ants a commission; they run here and&#10;there, as if they all had so much business to get through. They,&#10;most likely, will know of a wife for our youngster.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I certainly know a most beautiful bride,&#34; said one of the&#10;ants; &#34;but I fear it would not do, for she is a queen.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That does not matter,&#34; said the old snail; &#34;has she a&#10;house?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;She has a palace,&#34; replied the ant,&#8212;&#34;a most beautiful&#10;ant-palace with seven hundred passages.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Thank-you,&#34; said the mother-snail; &#34;but our boy shall not&#10;go to live in an ant-hill. If you know of nothing better, we will&#10;give the commission to the white gnats; they fly about in rain and&#10;sunshine; they know the burdock wood from one end to the&#10;other.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;We have a wife for him,&#34; said the gnats; &#34;a hundred&#10;man-steps from here there is a little snail with a house, sitting&#10;on a gooseberry-bush; she is quite alone, and old enough to be&#10;married. It is only a hundred man-steps from here.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Then let her come to him,&#34; said the old people. &#34;He has&#10;the whole burdock forest; she has only a bush.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;So they brought the little lady-snail. She took eight days&#10;to perform the journey; but that was just as it ought to be; for it&#10;showed her to be one of the right breeding. And then they had a&#10;wedding. Six glow-worms gave as much light as they could; but in&#10;other respects it was all very quiet; for the old snails could not&#10;bear festivities or a crowd. But a beautiful speech was made by the&#10;mother-snail. The father could not speak; he was too much overcome.&#10;Then they gave the whole burdock forest to the young snails as an&#10;inheritance, and repeated what they had so often said, that it was&#10;the finest place in the world, and that if they led upright and&#10;honorable lives, and their family increased, they and their&#10;children might some day be taken to the nobleman&#39;s palace, to be&#10;boiled black, and laid on a silver dish. And when they had finished&#10;speaking, the old couple crept into their houses, and came out no&#10;more; for they slept.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The young snail pair now ruled in the forest, and had a&#10;numerous progeny. But as the young ones were never boiled or laid&#10;in silver dishes, they concluded that the castle had fallen into&#10;decay, and that all the people in the world were dead; and as&#10;nobody contradicted them, they thought they must be right. And the&#10;rain fell upon the burdock-leaves, to play the drum for them, and&#10;the sun shone to paint colors on the burdock forest for them, and&#10;they were very happy; the whole family were entirely and perfectly&#10;happy. &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)

As he was kissing the&#10;flower a very little leaf fell from it and sunk down into the soft&#10;earth in the middle of a wood. It immediately took root, sprouted,&#10;and sent out shoots among the other plants.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What a ridiculous little shoot!&#34; said one. &#34;No one will&#10;recognize it; not even the thistle nor the&#10;stinging-nettle.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It must be a kind of garden plant,&#34; said another; and so&#10;they sneered and despised the plant as a thing from a&#10;garden.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Where are you coming?&#34; said the tall thistles whose&#10;leaves were all armed with thorns. &#34;It is stupid nonsense to allow&#10;yourself to shoot out in this way; we are not here to support&#10;you.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Winter came, and the plant was covered with snow, but the&#10;snow glittered over it as if it had sunshine beneath as well as&#10;above.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;When spring came, the plant appeared in full bloom: a more&#10;beautiful object than any other plant in the forest. And now the&#10;professor of botany presented himself, one who could explain his&#10;knowledge in black and white. He examined and tested the plant, but&#10;it did not belong to his system of botany, nor could he possibly&#10;find out to what class it did belong. &#34;It must be some degenerate&#10;species,&#34; said he; &#34;I do not know it, and it is not mentioned in&#10;any system.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Not known in any system!&#34; repeated the thistles and the&#10;nettles.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The large trees which grew round it saw the plant and&#10;heard the remarks, but they said not a word either good or bad,&#10;which is the wisest plan for those who are ignorant.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;There passed through the forest a poor innocent girl; her&#10;heart was pure, and her understanding increased by her faith. Her&#10;chief inheritance had been an old Bible, which she read and valued.&#10;From its pages she heard the voice of God speaking to her, and&#10;telling her to remember what was said of Joseph&#39;s brethren when&#10;persons wished to injure her. &#34;They imagined evil in their hearts,&#10;but God turned it to good.&#34; If we suffer wrongfully, if we are&#10;misunderstood or despised, we must think of Him who was pure and&#10;holy, and who prayed for those who nailed Him to the cross, &#34;Father&#10;forgive them, for they know not what they do.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The girl stood still before the wonderful plant, for the&#10;green leaves exhaled a sweet and refreshing fragrance, and the&#10;flowers glittered and sparkled in the sunshine like colored flames,&#10;and the harmony of sweet sounds lingered round them as if each&#10;concealed within itself a deep fount of melody, which thousands of&#10;years could not exhaust. With pious gratitude the girl looked upon&#10;this glorious work of God, and bent down over one of the branches,&#10;that she might examine the flower and inhale the sweet perfume.&#10;Then a light broke in on her mind, and her heart expanded. Gladly&#10;would she have plucked a flower, but she could not overcome her&#10;reluctance to break one off. She knew it would so soon fade; so she&#10;took only a single green leaf, carried it home, and laid it in her&#10;Bible, where it remained ever green, fresh, and unfading. Between&#10;the pages of the Bible it still lay when, a few weeks afterwards,&#10;that Bible was laid under the young girl&#39;s head in her coffin. A&#10;holy calm rested on her face, as if the earthly remains bore the&#10;impress of the truth that she now stood in the presence of&#10;God.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the forest the wonderful plant still continued to bloom&#10;till it grew and became almost a tree, and all the birds of passage&#10;bowed themselves before it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That plant is a foreigner, no doubt,&#34; said the thistles&#10;and the burdocks. &#34;We can never conduct ourselves like that in this&#10;country.&#34; And the black forest snails actually spat at the&#10;flower.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then came the swineherd; he was collecting thistles and&#10;shrubs to burn them for the ashes. He pulled up the wonderful&#10;plant, roots and all, and placed it in his bundle. &#34;This will be as&#10;useful as any,&#34; he said; so the plant was carried away.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Not long after, the king of the country suffered from the&#10;deepest melancholy. He was diligent and industrious, but employment&#10;did him no good. They read deep and learned books to him, and then&#10;the lightest and most trifling that could be found, but all to no&#10;purpose. Then they applied for advice to one of the wise men of the&#10;world, and he sent them a message to say that there was one remedy&#10;which would relieve and cure him, and that it was a plant of&#10;heavenly origin which grew in the forest in the king&#39;s own&#10;dominions. The messenger described the flower so that is appearance&#10;could not be mistaken.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then said the swineherd, &#34;I am afraid I carried this plant&#10;away from the forest in my bundle, and it has been burnt to ashes&#10;long ago. But I did not know any better.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You did not know, any better! Ignorance upon ignorance&#10;indeed!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The poor swineherd took these words to heart, for they&#10;were addressed to him; he knew not that there were others who were&#10;equally ignorant. Not even a leaf of the plant could be found.&#10;There was one, but it lay in the coffin of the dead; no one knew&#10;anything about it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the king, in his melancholy, wandered out to the spot&#10;in the wood. &#34;Here is where the plant stood,&#34; he said; &#34;it is a&#10;sacred place.&#34; Then he ordered that the place should be surrounded&#10;with a golden railing, and a sentry stationed near it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The botanical professor wrote a long treatise about the&#10;heavenly plant, and for this he was loaded with gold, which&#10;improved the position of himself and his family.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And this part is really the most pleasant part of the&#10;story. For the plant had disappeared, and the king remained as&#10;melancholy and sad as ever, but the sentry said he had always been&#10;so. &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;Holger Danske'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;IN Denmark there stands an old castle named Kronenburg,&#10;close by the Sound of Elsinore, where large ships, both English,&#10;Russian, and Prussian, pass by hundreds every day. And they salute&#10;the old castle with cannons, &#34;Boom, boom,&#34; which is as if they&#10;said, &#34;Good-day.&#34; And the cannons of the old castle answer &#34;Boom,&#34;&#10;which means &#34;Many thanks.&#34; In winter no ships sail by, for the&#10;whole Sound is covered with ice as far as the Swedish coast, and&#10;has quite the appearance of a high-road. The Danish and the Swedish&#10;flags wave, and Danes and Swedes say, &#34;Good-day,&#34; and &#34;Thank you&#34;&#10;to each other, not with cannons, but with a friendly shake of the&#10;hand; and they exchange white bread and biscuits with each other,&#10;because foreign articles taste the best.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But the most beautiful sight of all is the old castle of&#10;Kronenburg, where Holger Danske sits in the deep, dark cellar, into&#10;which no one goes. He is clad in iron and steel, and rests his head&#10;on his strong arm; his long beard hangs down upon the marble table,&#10;into which it has become firmly rooted; he sleeps and dreams, but&#10;in his dreams he sees everything that happens in Denmark. On each&#10;Christmas-eve an angel comes to him and tells him that all he has&#10;dreamed is true, and that he may go to sleep again in peace, as&#10;Denmark is not yet in any real danger; but should danger ever come,&#10;then Holger Danske will rouse himself, and the table will burst&#10;asunder as he draws out his beard. Then he will come forth in his&#10;strength, and strike a blow that shall sound in all the countries&#10;of the world.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;An old grandfather sat and told his little grandson all&#10;this about Holger Danske, and the boy knew that what his&#10;grandfather told him must be true. As the old man related this&#10;story, he was carving an image in wood to represent Holger Danske,&#10;to be fastened to the prow of a ship; for the old grandfather was a&#10;carver in wood, that is, one who carved figures for the heads of&#10;ships, according to the names given to them. And now he had carved&#10;Holger Danske, who stood there erect and proud, with his long&#10;beard, holding in one hand his broad battle-axe, while with the&#10;other he leaned on the Danish arms. The old grandfather told the&#10;little boy a great deal about Danish men and women who had&#10;distinguished themselves in olden times, so that he fancied he knew&#10;as much even as Holger Danske himself, who, after all, could only&#10;dream; and when the little fellow went to bed, he thought so much&#10;about it that he actually pressed his chin against the counterpane,&#10;and imagined that he had a long beard which had become rooted to&#10;it. But the old grandfather remained sitting at his work and&#10;carving away at the last part of it, which was the Danish arms. And&#10;when he had finished he looked at the whole figure, and thought of&#10;all he had heard and read, and what he had that evening related to&#10;his little grandson. Then he nodded his head, wiped his spectacles&#10;and put them on, and said, &#34;Ah, yes; Holger Danske will not appear&#10;in my lifetime, but the boy who is in bed there may very likely&#10;live to see him when the event really comes to pass.&#34; And the old&#10;grandfather nodded again; and the more he looked at Holger Danske,&#10;the more satisfied he felt that he had carved a good image of him.&#10;It seemed to glow with the color of life; the armor glittered like&#10;iron and steel. The hearts in the Danish arms grew more and more&#10;red; while the lions, with gold crowns on their heads, were leaping&#10;up. &#34;That is the most beautiful coat of arms in the world,&#34; said&#10;the old man. &#34;The lions represent strength; and the hearts,&#10;gentleness and love.&#34; And as he gazed on the uppermost lion, he&#10;thought of King Canute, who chained great England to Denmark&#39;s&#10;throne; and he looked at the second lion, and thought of Waldemar,&#10;who untied Denmark and conquered the Vandals. The third lion&#10;reminded him of Margaret, who united Denmark, Sweden, and Norway.&#10;But when he gazed at the red hearts, their colors glowed more&#10;deeply, even as flames, and his memory followed each in turn. The&#10;first led him to a dark, narrow prison, in which sat a prisoner, a&#10;beautiful woman, daughter of Christian the Fourth, Eleanor Ulfeld,&#10;and the flame became a rose on her bosom, and its blossoms were not&#10;more pure than the heart of this noblest and best of all Danish&#10;women. &#34;Ah, yes; that is indeed a noble heart in the Danish arms,&#34;&#10;said the grandfather. and his spirit followed the second flame,&#10;which carried him out to sea, where cannons roared and the ships&#10;lay shrouded in smoke, and the flaming heart attached itself to the&#10;breast of Hvitfeldt in the form of the ribbon of an order, as he&#10;blew himself and his ship into the air in order to save the fleet.&#10;And the third flame led him to Greenland&#39;s wretched huts, where the&#10;preacher, Hans Egede, ruled with love in every word and action. The&#10;flame was as a star on his breast, and added another heart to the&#10;Danish arms. And as the old grandfather&#39;s spirit followed the next&#10;hovering flame, he knew whither it would lead him. In a peasant&#10;woman&#39;s humble room stood Frederick the Sixth, writing his name&#10;with chalk on the beam. The flame trembled on his breast and in his&#10;heart, and it was in the peasant&#39;s room that his heart became one&#10;for the Danish arms. The old grandfather wiped his eyes, for he had&#10;known King Frederick, with his silvery locks and his honest blue&#10;eyes, and had lived for him, and he folded his hands and remained&#10;for some time silent. Then his daughter came to him and said it was&#10;getting late, that he ought to rest for a while, and that the&#10;supper was on the table.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What you have been carving is very beautiful,&#10;grandfather,&#34; said she. &#34;Holger Danske and the old coat of arms; it&#10;seems to me as if I have seen the face somewhere.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No, that is impossible,&#34; replied the old grandfather;&#10;&#34;but I have seen it, and I have tried to carve it in wood, as I&#10;have retained it in my memory. It was a long time ago, while the&#10;English fleet lay in the roads, on the second of April, when we&#10;showed that we were true, ancient Danes. I was on board the&#10;Denmark, in Steene Bille&#39;s squadron; I had a man by my side whom&#10;even the cannon balls seemed to fear. He sung old songs in a merry&#10;voice, and fired and fought as if he were something more than a&#10;man. I still remember his face, but from whence he came, or whither&#10;he went, I know not; no one knows. I have often thought it might&#10;have been Holger Danske himself, who had swam down to us from&#10;Kronenburg to help us in the hour of danger. That was my idea, and&#10;there stands his likeness.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The wooden figure threw a gigantic shadow on the wall, and&#10;even on part of the ceiling; it seemed as if the real Holger Danske&#10;stood behind it, for the shadow moved; but this was no doubt caused&#10;by the flame of the lamp not burning steadily. Then the&#10;daughter-in-law kissed the old grandfather, and led him to a large&#10;arm-chair by the table; and she, and her husband, who was the son&#10;of the old man and the father of the little boy who lay in bed, sat&#10;down to supper with him. And the old grandfather talked of the&#10;Danish lions and the Danish hearts, emblems of strength and&#10;gentleness, and explained quite clearly that there is another&#10;strength than that which lies in a sword, and he pointed to a shelf&#10;where lay a number of old books, and amongst them a collection of&#10;Holberg&#39;s plays, which are much read and are so clever and amusing&#10;that it is easy to fancy we have known the people of those days,&#10;who are described in them.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;He knew how to fight also,&#34; said the old man; &#34;for he&#10;lashed the follies and prejudices of people during his whole&#10;life.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the grandfather nodded to a place above the&#10;looking-glass, where hung an almanac, with a representation of the&#10;Round Tower upon it, and said &#34;Tycho Brahe was another of those who&#10;used a sword, but not one to cut into the flesh and bone, but to&#10;make the way of the stars of heaven clear, and plain to be&#10;understood. And then he whose father belonged to my calling,&#8212;yes,&#10;he, the son of the old image-carver, he whom we ourselves have&#10;seen, with his silvery locks and his broad shoulders, whose name is&#10;known in all lands;&#8212;yes, he was a sculptor, while I am only a&#10;carver. Holger Danske can appear in marble, so that people in all&#10;countries of the world may hear of the strength of Denmark. Now let&#10;us drink the health of Bertel.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But the little boy in bed saw plainly the old castle of&#10;Kronenburg, and the Sound of Elsinore, and Holger Danske, far down&#10;in the cellar, with his beard rooted to the table, and dreaming of&#10;everything that was passing above him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And Holger Danske did dream of the little humble room in&#10;which the image-carver sat; he heard all that had been said, and he&#10;nodded in his dream, saying, &#34;Ah, yes, remember me, you Danish&#10;people, keep me in your memory, I will come to you in the hour of&#10;need.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The bright morning light shone over Kronenburg, and the&#10;wind brought the sound of the hunting-horn across from the&#10;neighboring shores. The ships sailed by and saluted the castle with&#10;the boom of the cannon, and Kronenburg returned the salute, &#34;Boom,&#10;boom.&#34; But the roaring cannons did not awake Holger Danske, for&#10;they meant only &#34;Good morning,&#34; and &#34;Thank you.&#34; They must fire in&#10;another fashion before he awakes; but wake he will, for there is&#10;energy yet in Holger Danske. &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;Ib and Little Christina'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;IN the forest that extends from the banks of the Gudenau,&#10;in North Jutland, a long way into the country, and not far from the&#10;clear stream, rises a great ridge of land, which stretches through&#10;the wood like a wall. Westward of this ridge, and not far from the&#10;river, stands a farmhouse, surrounded by such poor land that the&#10;sandy soil shows itself between the scanty ears of rye and wheat&#10;which grow in it. Some years have passed since the people who lived&#10;here cultivated these fields; they kept three sheep, a pig, and two&#10;oxen; in fact they maintained themselves very well, they had quite&#10;enough to live upon, as people generally have who are content with&#10;their lot. They even could have afforded to keep two horses, but it&#10;was a saying among the farmers in those parts, &#34;The horse eats&#10;himself up;&#34; that is to say, he eats as much as he earns. Jeppe&#10;Jans cultivated his fields in summer, and in the winter he made&#10;wooden shoes. He also had an assistant, a lad who understood as&#10;well as he himself did how to make wooden shoes strong, but light,&#10;and in the fashion. They carved shoes and spoons, which paid well;&#10;therefore no one could justly call Jeppe Jans and his family poor&#10;people. Little Ib, a boy of seven years old and the only child,&#10;would sit by, watching the workmen, or cutting a stick, and&#10;sometimes his finger instead of the stick. But one day Ib succeeded&#10;so well in his carving that he made two pieces of wood look really&#10;like two little wooden shoes, and he determined to give them as a&#10;present to Little Christina.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And who was Little Christina?&#34; She was the boatman&#39;s&#10;daughter, graceful and delicate as the child of a gentleman; had&#10;she been dressed differently, no one would have believed that she&#10;lived in a hut on the neighboring heath with her father. He was a&#10;widower, and earned his living by carrying firewood in his large&#10;boat from the forest to the eel-pond and eel-weir, on the estate of&#10;Silkborg, and sometimes even to the distant town of Randers. There&#10;was no one under whose care he could leave Little Christina; so she&#10;was almost always with him in his boat, or playing in the wood&#10;among the blossoming heath, or picking the ripe wild berries.&#10;Sometimes, when her father had to go as far as the town, he would&#10;take Little Christina, who was a year younger than Ib, across the&#10;heath to the cottage of Jeppe Jans, and leave her there. Ib and&#10;Christina agreed together in everything; they divided their bread&#10;and berries when they were hungry; they were partners in digging&#10;their little gardens; they ran, and crept, and played about&#10;everywhere. Once they wandered a long way into the forest, and even&#10;ventured together to climb the high ridge. Another time they found&#10;a few snipes&#39; eggs in the wood, which was a great event. Ib had&#10;never been on the heath where Christina&#39;s father lived, nor on the&#10;river; but at last came an opportunity. Christina&#39;s father invited&#10;him to go for a sail in his boat; and the evening before, he&#10;accompanied the boatman across the heath to his house. The next&#10;morning early, the two children were placed on the top of a high&#10;pile of firewood in the boat, and sat eating bread and wild&#10;strawberries, while Christina&#39;s father and his man drove the boat&#10;forward with poles. They floated on swiftly, for the tide was in&#10;their favor, passing over lakes, formed by the stream in its&#10;course; sometimes they seemed quite enclosed by reeds and&#10;water-plants, yet there was always room for them to pass out,&#10;although the old trees overhung the water and the old oaks&#10;stretched out their bare branches, as if they had turned up their&#10;sleeves and wished to show their knotty, naked arms. Old&#10;alder-trees, whose roots were loosened from the banks, clung with&#10;their fibres to the bottom of the stream, and the tops of the&#10;branches above the water looked like little woody islands. The&#10;water-lilies waved themselves to and fro on the river, everything&#10;made the excursion beautiful, and at last they came to the great&#10;eel-weir, where the water rushed through the flood-gates; and the&#10;children thought this a beautiful sight. In those days there was no&#10;factory nor any town house, nothing but the great farm, with its&#10;scanty-bearing fields, in which could be seen a few herd of cattle,&#10;and one or two farm laborers. The rushing of the water through the&#10;sluices, and the scream of the wild ducks, were almost the only&#10;signs of active life at Silkborg. After the firewood had been&#10;unloaded, Christina&#39;s father bought a whole bundle of eels and a&#10;sucking-pig, which were all placed in a basket in the stern of the&#10;boat. Then they returned again up the stream; and as the wind was&#10;favorable, two sails were hoisted, which carried the boat on as&#10;well as if two horses had been harnessed to it. As they sailed on,&#10;they came by chance to the place where the boatman&#39;s assistant&#10;lived, at a little distance from the bank of the river. The boat&#10;was moored; and the two men, after desiring the children to sit&#10;still, both went on shore. they obeyed this order for a very short&#10;time, and then forgot it altogether. First they peeped into the&#10;basket containing the eels and the sucking-pig; then they must&#10;needs pull out the pig and take it in their hands, and feel it, and&#10;touch it; and as they both wanted to hold it at the same time, the&#10;consequence was that they let it fall into the water, and the pig&#10;sailed away with the stream.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Here was a terrible disaster. Ib jumped ashore, and ran a&#10;little distance from the boat.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, take me with you,&#34; cried Christina; and she sprang&#10;after him. In a few minutes they found themselves deep in a&#10;thicket, and could no longer see the boat or the shore. They ran on&#10;a little farther, and then Christina fell down, and began to&#10;cry.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Ib helped her up, and said, &#34;Never mind; follow me. Yonder&#10;is the house.&#34; But the house was not yonder; and they wandered&#10;still farther, over the dry rustling leaves of the last year, and&#10;treading on fallen branches that crackled under their little feet;&#10;then they heard a loud, piercing cry, and they stood still to&#10;listen. Presently the scream of an eagle sounded through the wood;&#10;it was an ugly cry, and it frightened the children; but before&#10;them, in the thickest part of the forest, grew the most beautiful&#10;blackberries, in wonderful quantities. They looked so inviting that&#10;the children could not help stopping; and they remained there so&#10;long eating, that their mouths and cheeks became quite black with&#10;the juice.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Presently they heard the frightful scream again, and&#10;Christina said, &#34;We shall get into trouble about that&#10;pig.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, never mind,&#34; said Ib; &#34;we will go home to my father&#39;s&#10;house. It is here in the wood.&#34; So they went on, but the road led&#10;them out of the way; no house could be seen, it grew dark, and the&#10;children were afraid. The solemn stillness that reigned around them&#10;was now and then broken by the shrill cries of the great horned owl&#10;and other birds that they knew nothing of. At last they both lost&#10;themselves in the thicket; Christina began to cry, and then Ib&#10;cried too; and, after weeping and lamenting for some time, they&#10;stretched themselves down on the dry leaves and fell&#10;asleep.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The sun was high in the heavens when the two children&#10;woke. They felt cold; but not far from their resting-place, on a&#10;hill, the sun was shining through the trees. They thought if they&#10;went there they should be warm, and Ib fancied he should be able to&#10;see his father&#39;s house from such a high spot. But they were far&#10;away from home now, in quite another part of the forest. They&#10;clambered to the top of the rising ground, and found themselves on&#10;the edge of a declivity, which sloped down to a clear transparent&#10;lake. Great quantities of fish could be seen through the clear&#10;water, sparkling in the sun&#39;s rays; they were quite surprised when&#10;they came so suddenly upon such an unexpected sight.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Close to where they stood grew a hazel-bush, covered with&#10;beautiful nuts. They soon gathered some, cracked them, and ate the&#10;fine young kernels, which were only just ripe. But there was&#10;another surprise and fright in store for them. Out of the thicket&#10;stepped a tall old woman, her face quite brown, and her hair of a&#10;deep shining black; the whites of her eyes glittered like a Moor&#39;s;&#10;on her back she carried a bundle, and in her hand a knotted stick.&#10;She was a gypsy. The children did not at first understand what she&#10;said. She drew out of her pocket three large nuts, in which she&#10;told them were hidden the most beautiful and lovely things in the&#10;world, for they were wishing nuts. Ib looked at her, and as she&#10;spoke so kindly, he took courage, and asked her if she would give&#10;him the nuts; and the woman gave them to him, and then gathered&#10;some more from the bushes for herself, quite a pocket full. Ib and&#10;Christina looked at the wishing nuts with wide open&#10;eyes.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Is there in this nut a carriage, with a pair of horses?&#34;&#10;asked Ib.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, there is a golden carriage, with two golden horses,&#34;&#10;replied the woman.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Then give me that nut,&#34; said Christina; so Ib gave it to&#10;her, and the strange woman tied up the nut for her in her&#10;handkerchief.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Ib held up another nut. &#34;Is there, in this nut, a pretty&#10;little neckerchief like the one Christina has on her neck?&#34; asked&#10;Ib.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;There are ten neckerchiefs in it,&#34; she replied, &#34;as well&#10;as beautiful dresses, stockings, and a hat and veil.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Then I will have that one also,&#34; said Christina; &#34;and it&#10;is a pretty one too. And then Ib gave her the second&#10;nut.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The third was a little black thing. &#34;You may keep that&#10;one,&#34; said Christina; &#34;it is quite as pretty.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What is in it?&#34; asked Ib.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The best of all things for you,&#34; replied the gypsy. So Ib&#10;held the nut very tight.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the woman promised to lead the children to the right&#10;path, that they might find their way home: and they went forward&#10;certainly in quite another direction to the one they meant to take;&#10;therefore no one ought to speak against the woman, and say that she&#10;wanted to steal the children. In the wild wood-path they met a&#10;forester who knew Ib, and, by his help, Ib and Christina reached&#10;home, where they found every one had been very anxious about them.&#10;They were pardoned and forgiven, although they really had both done&#10;wrong, and deserved to get into trouble; first, because they had&#10;let the sucking-pig fall into the water; and, secondly, because&#10;they had run away. Christina was taken back to her father&#39;s house&#10;on the heath, and Ib remained in the farm-house on the borders of&#10;the wood, near the great land ridge.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The first thing Ib did that evening was to take out of his&#10;pocket the little black nut, in which the best thing of all was&#10;said to be enclosed. He laid it carefully between the door and the&#10;door-post, and then shut the door so that the nut cracked directly.&#10;But there was not much kernel to be seen; it was what we should&#10;call hollow or worm-eaten, and looked as if it had been filled with&#10;tobacco or rich black earth. &#34;It is just what I expected!&#34;&#10;exclaimed Ib. &#34;How should there be room in a little nut like this&#10;for the best thing of all? Christina will find her two nuts just&#10;the same; there will be neither fine clothes or a golden carriage&#10;in them.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Winter came; and the new year, and indeed many years&#10;passed away; until Ib was old enough to be confirmed, and,&#10;therefore, he went during a whole winter to the clergyman of the&#10;nearest village to be prepared.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;One day, about this time, the boatman paid a visit to Ib&#39;s&#10;parents, and told them that Christina was going to service, and&#10;that she had been remarkably fortunate in obtaining a good place,&#10;with most respectable people. &#34;Only think,&#34; he said, &#34;She is going&#10;to the rich innkeeper&#39;s, at the hotel in Herning, many miles west&#10;from here. She is to assist the landlady in the housekeeping; and,&#10;if afterwards she behaves well and remains to be confirmed, the&#10;people will treat her as their own daughter.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;So Ib and Christina took leave of each other. People&#10;already called them &#34;the betrothed,&#34; and at parting the girl showed&#10;Ib the two nuts, which she had taken care of ever since the time&#10;that they lost themselves in the wood; and she told him also that&#10;the little wooden shoes he once carved for her when he was a boy,&#10;and gave her as a present, had been carefully kept in a drawer ever&#10;since. And so they parted.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;After Ib&#39;s confirmation, he remained at home with his&#10;mother, for he had become a clever shoemaker, and in summer managed&#10;the farm for her quite alone. His father had been dead some time,&#10;and his mother kept no farm servants. Sometimes, but very seldom,&#10;he heard of Christina, through a postillion or eel-seller who was&#10;passing. But she was well off with the rich innkeeper; and after&#10;being confirmed she wrote a letter to her father, in which was a&#10;kind message to Ib and his mother. In this letter, she mentioned&#10;that her master and mistress had made her a present of a beautiful&#10;new dress, and some nice under-clothes. This was, of course,&#10;pleasant news.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;One day, in the following spring, there came a knock at&#10;the door of the house where Ib&#39;s old mother lived; and when they&#10;opened it, lo and behold, in stepped the boatman and Christina. She&#10;had come to pay them a visit, and to spend the day. A carriage had&#10;to come from the Herning hotel to the next village, and she had&#10;taken the opportunity to see her friends once more. She looked as&#10;elegant as a real lady, and wore a pretty dress, beautifully made&#10;on purpose for her. There she stood, in full dress, while Ib wore&#10;only his working clothes. He could not utter a word; he could only&#10;seize her hand and hold it fast in his own, but he felt too happy&#10;and glad to open his lips. Christina, however, was quite at her&#10;ease; she talked and talked, and kissed him in the most friendly&#10;manner. Even afterwards, when they were left alone, and she asked,&#10;&#34;Did you know me again, Ib?&#34; he still stood holding her hand, and&#10;said at last, &#34;You are become quite a grand lady, Christina, and I&#10;am only a rough working man; but I have often thought of you and of&#10;old times.&#34; Then they wandered up the great ridge, and looked&#10;across the stream to the heath, where the little hills were covered&#10;with the flowering broom. Ib said nothing; but before the time came&#10;for them to part, it became quite clear to him that Christina must&#10;be his wife: had they not even in childhood been called the&#10;betrothed? To him it seemed as if they were really engaged to each&#10;other, although not a word had been spoken on the subject. They had&#10;only a few more hours to remain together, for Christina was obliged&#10;to return that evening to the neighboring village, to be ready for&#10;the carriage which was to start the next morning early for Herning.&#10;Ib and her father accompanied her to the village. It was a fine&#10;moonlight evening; and when they arrived, Ib stood holding&#10;Christina&#39;s hand in his, as if he could not let her go. His eyes&#10;brightened, and the words he uttered came with hesitation from his&#10;lips, but from the deepest recesses of his heart: &#34;Christina, if&#10;you have not become too grand, and if you can be contented to live&#10;in my mother&#39;s house as my wife, we will be married some day. But&#10;we can wait for a while.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh yes,&#34; she replied; &#34;Let us wait a little longer, Ib. I&#10;can trust you, for I believe that I do love you. But let me think&#10;it over.&#34; Then he kissed her lips; and so they parted.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;On the way home, Ib told the boatman that he and Christina&#10;were as good as engaged to each other; and the boatman found out&#10;that he had always expected it would be so, and went home with Ib&#10;that evening, and remained the night in the farmhouse; but nothing&#10;further was said of the engagement. During the next year, two&#10;letters passed between Ib and Christina. They were signed,&#10;&#34;Faithful till death;&#34; but at the end of that time, one day the&#10;boatman came over to see Ib, with a kind greeting from Christina.&#10;He had something else to say, which made him hesitate in a strange&#10;manner. At last it came out that Christina, who had grown a very&#10;pretty girl, was more lucky than ever. She was courted and admired&#10;by every one; but her master&#39;s son, who had been home on a visit,&#10;was so much pleased with Christina that he wished to marry her. He&#10;had a very good situation in an office at Copenhagen, and as she&#10;had also taken a liking for him, his parents were not unwilling to&#10;consent. But Christina, in her heart, often thought of Ib, and knew&#10;how much he thought of her; so she felt inclined to refuse this&#10;good fortune, added the boatman. At first Ib said not a word, but&#10;he became as white as the wall, and shook his head gently, and then&#10;he spoke,&#8212;&#34;Christina must not refuse this good fortune.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Then will you write a few words to her?&#34; said the&#10;boatman.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Ib sat down to write, but he could not get on at all. The&#10;words were not what he wished to say, so he tore up the page. The&#10;following morning, however, a letter lay ready to be sent to&#10;Christina, and the following is what he wrote:&#8212;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The letter written by you to your father I have read, and&#10;see from it that you are prosperous in everything, and that still&#10;better fortune is in store for you. Ask your own heart, Christina,&#10;and think over carefully what awaits you if you take me for your&#10;husband, for I possess very little in the world. Do not think of me&#10;or of my position; think only of your own welfare. You are bound to&#10;me by no promises; and if in your heart you have given me one, I&#10;release you from it. May every blessing and happiness be poured out&#10;upon you, Christina. Heaven will give me the heart&#39;s&#10;consolation.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Ever your sincere friend, IB.&#34;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;This letter was sent, and Christina received it in due&#10;time. In the course of the following November, her banns were&#10;published in the church on the heath, and also in Copenhagen, where&#10;the bridegroom lived. She was taken to Copenhagen under the&#10;protection of her future mother-in-law, because the bridegroom&#10;could not spare time from his numerous occupations for a journey so&#10;far into Jutland. On the journey, Christina met her father at one&#10;of the villages through which they passed, and here he took leave&#10;of her. Very little was said about the matter to Ib, and he did not&#10;refer to it; his mother, however, noticed that he had grown very&#10;silent and pensive. Thinking as he did of old times, no wonder the&#10;three nuts came into his mind which the gypsy woman had given him&#10;when a child, and of the two which he had given to Christina. These&#10;wishing nuts, after all, had proved true fortune-tellers. One had&#10;contained a gilded carriage and noble horses, and the other&#10;beautiful clothes; all of these Christina would now have in her new&#10;home at Copenhagen. Her part had come true. And for him the nut had&#10;contained only black earth. The gypsy woman had said it was the&#10;best for him. Perhaps it was, and this also would be fulfilled. He&#10;understood the gypsy woman&#39;s meaning now. The black earth&#8212;the dark&#10;grave&#8212;was the best thing for him now.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Again years passed away; not many, but they seemed long&#10;years to Ib. The old innkeeper and his wife died one after the&#10;other; and the whole of their property, many thousand dollars, was&#10;inherited by their son. Christina could have the golden carriage&#10;now, and plenty of fine clothes. During the two long years which&#10;followed, no letter came from Christina to her father; and when at&#10;last her father received one from her, it did not speak of&#10;prosperity or happiness. Poor Christina! Neither she nor her&#10;husband understood how to economize or save, and the riches brought&#10;no blessing with them, because they had not asked for&#10;it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Years passed; and for many summers the heath was covered&#10;with bloom; in winter the snow rested upon it, and the rough winds&#10;blew across the ridge under which stood Ib&#39;s sheltered home. One&#10;spring day the sun shone brightly, and he was guiding the plough&#10;across his field. The ploughshare struck against something which he&#10;fancied was a firestone, and then he saw glittering in the earth a&#10;splinter of shining metal which the plough had cut from something&#10;which gleamed brightly in the furrow. He searched, and found a&#10;large golden armlet of superior workmanship, and it was evident&#10;that the plough had disturbed a Hun&#39;s grave. He searched further,&#10;and found more valuable treasures, which Ib showed to the&#10;clergyman, who explained their value to him. Then he went to the&#10;magistrate, who informed the president of the museum of the&#10;discovery, and advised Ib to take the treasures himself to the&#10;president.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You have found in the earth the best thing you could&#10;find,&#34; said the magistrate.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The best thing,&#34; thought Ib; &#34;the very best thing for&#10;me,&#8212;and found in the earth! Well, if it really is so, then the&#10;gypsy woman was right in her prophecy.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;So Ib went in the ferry-boat from Aarhus to Copenhagen. To&#10;him who had only sailed once or twice on the river near his own&#10;home, this seemed like a voyage on the ocean; and at length he&#10;arrived at Copenhagen. The value of the gold he had found was paid&#10;to him; it was a large sum&#8212;six hundred dollars. Then Ib of the&#10;heath went out, and wandered about in the great city.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;On the evening before the day he had settled to return&#10;with the captain of the passage-boat, Ib lost himself in the&#10;streets, and took quite a different turning to the one he wished to&#10;follow. He wandered on till he found himself in a poor street of&#10;the suburb called Christian&#39;s Haven. Not a creature could be seen.&#10;At last a very little girl came out of one of the wretched-looking&#10;houses, and Ib asked her to tell him the way to the street he&#10;wanted; she looked up timidly at him, and began to cry bitterly. He&#10;asked her what was the matter; but what she said he could not&#10;understand. So he went along the street with her; and as they&#10;passed under a lamp, the light fell on the little girl&#39;s face. A&#10;strange sensation came over Ib, as he caught sight of it. The&#10;living, breathing embodiment of Little Christina stood before him,&#10;just as he remembered her in the days of her childhood. He followed&#10;the child to the wretched house, and ascended the narrow, crazy&#10;staircase which led to a little garret in the roof. The air in the&#10;room was heavy and stifling, no light was burning, and from one&#10;corner came sounds of moaning and sighing. It was the mother of the&#10;child who lay there on a miserable bed. With the help of a match,&#10;Ib struck a light, and approached her.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Can I be of any service to you?&#34; he asked. &#34;This little&#10;girl brought me up here; but I am a stranger in this city. Are&#10;there no neighbors or any one whom I can call?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then he raised the head of the sick woman, and smoothed&#10;her pillow. He started as he did so. It was Christina of the heath!&#10;No one had mentioned her name to Ib for years; it would have&#10;disturbed his peace of mind, especially as the reports respecting&#10;her were not good. The wealth which her husband had inherited from&#10;his parents had made him proud and arrogant. He had given up his&#10;certain appointment, and travelled for six months in foreign lands,&#10;and, on his return, had lived in great style, and got into terrible&#10;debt. For a time he had trembled on the high pedestal on which he&#10;had placed himself, till at last he toppled over, and ruin came.&#10;His numerous merry companions, and the visitors at his table, said&#10;it served him right, for he had kept house like a madman. One&#10;morning his corpse was found in the canal. The cold hand of death&#10;had already touched the heart of Christina. Her youngest child,&#10;looked for in the midst of prosperity, had sunk into the grave when&#10;only a few weeks old; and at last Christina herself became sick&#10;unto death, and lay, forsaken and dying, in a miserable room, amid&#10;poverty she might have borne in her younger days, but which was now&#10;more painful to her from the luxuries to which she had lately been&#10;accustomed. It was her eldest child, also a Little Christina, whom&#10;Ib had followed to her home, where she suffered hunger and poverty&#10;with her mother.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It makes me unhappy to think that I shall die, and leave&#10;this poor child,&#34; sighed she. &#34;Oh, what will become of her?&#34; She&#10;could say no more.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then Ib brought out another match, and lighted a piece of&#10;candle which he found in the room, and it threw a glimmering light&#10;over the wretched dwelling. Ib looked at the little girl, and&#10;thought of Christina in her young days. For her sake, could he not&#10;love this child, who was a stranger to him? As he thus reflected,&#10;the dying woman opened her eyes, and gazed at him. Did she&#10;recognize him? He never knew; for not another word escaped her&#10;lips.&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;hr /&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the forest by the river Gudenau, not far from the&#10;heath, and beneath the ridge of land, stood the little farm, newly&#10;painted and whitewashed. The air was heavy and dark; there were no&#10;blossoms on the heath; the autumn winds whirled the yellow leaves&#10;towards the boatman&#39;s hut, in which strangers dwelt; but the little&#10;farm stood safely sheltered beneath the tall trees and the high&#10;ridge. The turf blazed brightly on the hearth, and within was&#10;sunlight, the sparkling light from the sunny eyes of a child; the&#10;birdlike tones from the rosy lips ringing like the song of a lark&#10;in spring. All was life and joy. Little Christina sat on Ib&#39;s knee.&#10;Ib was to her both father and mother; her own parents had vanished&#10;from her memory, as a dream-picture vanishes alike from childhood&#10;and age. Ib&#39;s house was well and prettily furnished; for he was a&#10;prosperous man now, while the mother of the little girl rested in&#10;the churchyard at Copenhagen, where she had died in poverty. Ib had&#10;money now&#8212;money which had come to him out of the black earth; and&#10;he had Christina for his own, after all. &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Jewish Maiden'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;IN a charity school, among the children, sat a little&#10;Jewish girl. She was a good, intelligent child, and very quick at&#10;her lessons; but the Scripture-lesson class she was not allowed to&#10;join, for this was a Christian school. During the hour of this&#10;lesson, the Jewish girl was allowed to learn her geography, or to&#10;work her sum for the next day; and when her geography lesson was&#10;perfect, the book remained open before her, but she read not&#10;another word, for she sat silently listening to the words of the&#10;Christian teacher. He soon became aware that the little one was&#10;paying more attention to what he said than most of the other&#10;children. &#34;Read your book, Sarah,&#34; he said to her&#10;gently.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But again and again he saw her dark, beaming eyes fixed&#10;upon him; and once, when he asked her a question, she could answer&#10;him even better than the other children. She had not only heard,&#10;but understood his words, and pondered them in her heart. Her&#10;father, a poor but honest man, had placed his daughter at the&#10;school on the conditions that she should not be instructed in the&#10;Christian faith. But it might have caused confusion, or raised&#10;discontent in the minds of the other children if she had been sent&#10;out of the room, so she remained; and now it was evident this could&#10;not go on. The teacher went to her father, and advised him to&#10;remove his daughter from the school, or to allow her to become a&#10;Christian. &#34;I cannot any longer be an idle spectator of those&#10;beaming eyes, which express such a deep and earnest longing for the&#10;words of the gospel,&#34; said he.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the father burst into tears. &#34;I know very little of&#10;the law of my fathers,&#34; said he; &#34;but Sarah&#39;s mother was firm in&#10;her belief as a daughter of Israel, and I vowed to her on her&#10;deathbed that our child should never be baptized. I must keep my&#10;vow: it is to me even as a covenant with God Himself.&#34; And so the&#10;little Jewish girl left the Christian school.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Years rolled by. In one of the smallest provincial towns,&#10;in a humble household, lived a poor maiden of the Jewish faith, as&#10;a servant. Her hair was black as ebony, her eye dark as night, yet&#10;full of light and brilliancy so peculiar to the daughters of the&#10;east. It was Sarah. The expression in the face of the grown-up&#10;maiden was still the same as when, a child, she sat on the&#10;schoolroom form listening with thoughtful eyes to the words of the&#10;Christian teacher. Every Sunday there sounded forth from a church&#10;close by the tones of an organ and the singing of the congregation.&#10;The Jewish girl heard them in the house where, industrious and&#10;faithful in all things, she performed her household duties. &#34;Thou&#10;shalt keep the Sabbath holy,&#34; said the voice of the law in her&#10;heart; but her Sabbath was a working day among the Christians,&#10;which was a great trouble to her. And then as the thought arose in&#10;her mind, &#34;Does God reckon by days and hours?&#34; her conscience felt&#10;satisfied on this question, and she found it a comfort to her, that&#10;on the Christian Sabbath she could have an hour for her own prayers&#10;undisturbed. The music and singing of the congregation sounded in&#10;her ears while at work in her kitchen, till the place itself became&#10;sacred to her. Then she would read in the Old Testament, that&#10;treasure and comfort to her people, and it was indeed the only&#10;Scriptures she could read. Faithfully in her inmost thoughts had&#10;she kept the words of her father to her teacher when she left the&#10;school, and the vow he had made to her dying mother that she should&#10;never receive Christian baptism. The New Testament must remain to&#10;her a sealed book, and yet she knew a great deal of its teaching,&#10;and the sound of the gospel truths still lingered among the&#10;recollections of her childhood.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;One evening she was sitting in a corner of the&#10;dining-room, while her master read aloud. It was not the gospel he&#10;read, but an old story-book; therefore she might stay and listen to&#10;him. The story related that a Hungarian knight, who had been taken&#10;prisoner by a Turkish pasha, was most cruelly treated by him. He&#10;caused him to be yoked with his oxen to the plough, and driven with&#10;blows from the whip till the blood flowed, and he almost sunk with&#10;exhaustion and pain. The faithful wife of the knight at home gave&#10;up all her jewels, mortgaged her castle and land, and his friends&#10;raised large sums to make up the ransom demanded for his release,&#10;which was most enormously high. It was collected at last, and the&#10;knight released from slavery and misery. Sick and exhausted, he&#10;reached home.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Ere long came another summons to a struggle with the foes&#10;of Christianity. The still living knight heard the sound; he could&#10;endure no more, he had neither peace nor rest. He caused himself to&#10;be lifted on his war-horse; the color came into his cheeks, and his&#10;strength returned to him again as he went forth to battle and to&#10;victory. The very same pasha who had yoked him to the plough,&#10;became his prisoner, and was dragged to a dungeon in the castle.&#10;But an hour had scarcely passed, when the knight stood before the&#10;captive pasha, and inquired, &#34;What do you suppose awaiteth&#10;thee?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I know,&#34; replied the pasha; &#34;retribution.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, the retribution of a Christian,&#34; replied the knight.&#10;&#34;The teaching of Christ, the Teacher, commands us to forgive our&#10;enemies, to love our neighbors; for God is love. Depart in peace:&#10;return to thy home. I give thee back to thy loved ones. But in&#10;future be mild and humane to all who are in trouble.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the prisoner burst into tears, and exclaimed, &#34;Oh how&#10;could I imagine such mercy and forgiveness! I expected pain and&#10;torment. It seemed to me so sure that I took poison, which I&#10;secretly carried about me; and in a few hours its effects will&#10;destroy me. I must die! Nothing can save me! But before I die,&#10;explain to me the teaching which is so full of love and mercy, so&#10;great and God-like. Oh, that I may hear his teaching, and die a&#10;Christian!&#34; And his prayer was granted.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;This was the legend which the master read out of the old&#10;story-book. Every one in the house who was present listened, and&#10;shared the pleasure; but Sarah, the Jewish girl, sitting so still&#10;in a corner, felt her heart burn with excitement. Great tears came&#10;into her shining dark eyes; and with the same gentle piety with&#10;which she had once listened to the gospel while sitting on the form&#10;at school, she felt its grandeur now, and the tears rolled down her&#10;cheeks. Then the last words of her dying mother rose before her,&#10;&#34;Let not my child become a Christian;&#34; and with them sounded in her&#10;heart the words of the law, &#34;Honor thy father and thy&#10;mother.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I am not admitted among the Christians,&#34; she said; &#34;they&#10;mock me as a Jewish girl; the neighbors&#39; boys did so last Sunday&#10;when I stood looking in through the open church door at the candles&#10;burning on the altar, and listening to the singing. Ever since I&#10;sat on the school-bench I have felt the power of Christianity; a&#10;power which, like a sunbeam, streams into my heart, however closely&#10;I may close my eyes against it. But I will not grieve thee, my&#10;mother, in thy grave. I will not be unfaithful to my father&#39;s vow.&#10;I will not read the Bible of the Christian. I have the God of my&#10;fathers, and in Him I will trust.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And again years passed by. Sarah&#39;s master died, and his&#10;widow found herself in such reduced circumstances that she wished&#10;to dismiss her servant maid; but Sarah refused to leave the house,&#10;and she became a true support in time of trouble, and kept the&#10;household together by working till late at night, with her busy&#10;hands, to earn their daily bread. Not a relative came forward to&#10;assist them, and the widow was confined to a sick bed for months&#10;and grew weaker from day to day. Sarah worked hard, but contrived&#10;to spare time to amuse her and watch by the sick bed. She was&#10;gentle and pious, an angel of blessing in that house of&#10;poverty.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;My Bible lies on the table yonder,&#34; said the sick woman&#10;one day to Sarah. &#34;Read me something from it; the night appears so&#10;long, and my spirit thirsts to hear the word of God.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And Sarah bowed her head. She took the book, and folded&#10;her hand over the Bible of the Christians, and at last opened it,&#10;and read to the sick woman. Tears stood in her eyes as she read,&#10;and they shone with brightness, for in her heart it was&#10;light.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Mother,&#34; she murmured, &#34;thy child may not receive&#10;Christian baptism, nor be admitted into the congregation of&#10;Christian people. Thou hast so willed it, and I will respect thy&#10;command. We are therefore still united here on earth; but in the&#10;next world there will be a higher union, even with God Himself, who&#10;leads and guides His people till death. He came down from heaven to&#10;earth to suffer for us, that we should bring forth the fruits of&#10;repentance. I understand it now. I know not how I learnt this&#10;truth, unless it is through the name of Christ.&#34; Yet she trembled&#10;as she pronounced the holy name. She struggled against these&#10;convictions of the truth of Christianity for some days, till one&#10;evening while watching her mistress she was suddenly taken very&#10;ill; her limbs tottered under her, and she sank fainting by the&#10;bedside of the sick woman.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Poor Sarah,&#34; said the neighbors; &#34;she is overcome with&#10;hard work and night watching.&#34; And then they carried her to the&#10;hospital for the sick poor. There she died; and they bore her to&#10;her resting-place in the earth, but not to the churchyard of the&#10;Christians. There was no place for the Jewish girl; but they dug a&#10;grave for her outside the wall. And God&#39;s sun, which shines upon&#10;the graves of the churchyard of the Christians, also throws its&#10;beams on the grave of the Jewish maiden beyond the wall. And when&#10;the psalms of the Christians sound across the churchyard, their&#10;echo reaches her lonely resting-place; and she who sleeps there&#10;will be counted worthy at the resurrection, through the name of&#10;Christ the Lord, who said to His disciples, &#34;John baptized you with&#10;water, but I will baptize you with the Holy Ghost.&#34;&#10;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Jumper'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;THE Flea, the Grasshopper, and the Skipjack once wanted to&#10;see which of them could jump highest; and they invited the whole&#10;world, and whoever else would come, to see the grand sight. And&#10;there the three famous jumpers were met together in the&#10;room.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, I&#39;ll give my daughter to him who jumps highest,&#34;&#10;said the King, &#34;for it would be mean to let these people jump for&#10;nothing.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Flea stepped out first. He had very pretty manners,&#10;and bowed in all directions, for he had young ladies&#39; blood in his&#10;veins, and was accustomed to consort only with human beings; and&#10;that was of great consequence.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then came the Grasshopper: he was certainly much heavier,&#10;but he had a good figure, and wore the green uniform that was born&#10;with him. This person, moreover, maintained that he belonged to a&#10;very old family in the land of Egypt, and that he was highly&#10;esteemed there. He had just come from the field, he said, and had&#10;been put into a card house three stories high, and all made of&#10;picture cards with the figures turned inwards. There were doors and&#10;windows in the house, cut in the body of the Queen of&#10;Hearts.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I sing so,&#34; he said, &#34;that sixteen native crickets who&#10;have chirped from their youth up, and have never yet had a card&#10;house of their own, would become thinner than they are with envy if&#10;they were to hear me.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Both of them, the Flea and the Grasshopper, took care to&#10;announce who they were, and that they considered themselves&#10;entitled to marry a Princess.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Skipjack said nothing, but it was said of him that he&#10;thought all the more; and directly the Yard Dog had smelt at him he&#10;was ready to assert that the Skipjack was of good family, and&#10;formed from the breastbone of an undoubted goose. The old&#10;councillor, who had received three medals for holding his tongue,&#10;declared that the Skipjack possessed the gift of prophecy; one&#10;could tell by his bones whether there would be a severe winter or a&#10;mild one; and that&#39;s more than one can always tell from the&#10;breastbone of the man who writes the almanac.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I shall not say anything more,&#34; said the old King. &#34;I&#10;only go on quietly, and always think the best.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Now they were to take their jump. The Flea sprang so high&#10;that no one could see him; and then they asserted that he had not&#10;jumped at all. That was very mean. The Grasshopper only sprang half&#10;as high, but he sprang straight into the King&#39;s face, and the King&#10;declared that was horribly rude. The Skipjack stood a long time&#10;considering; at last people thought that he could not jump at&#10;all.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I only hope he&#39;s not become unwell,&#34; said the Yard Dog,&#10;and then he smelt at him again.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Tap!&#34; he sprang with a little crooked jump just into the&#10;lap of the Princess, who sat on a low golden stool.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the King said, &#34;The highest leap was taken by him who&#10;jumped up to my daughter; for therein lies the point; but it&#10;requires head to achieve that, and the Skipjack has shown that he&#10;has a head.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And so he had the Princess.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I jumped highest, after all,&#34; said the Flea. &#34;But it&#39;s&#10;all the same. Let her have the goose-bone with its lump of wax and&#10;bit of stick. I jumped to the highest; but in this world a body is&#10;required if one wishes to be seen.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the Flea went into foreign military service, where it&#10;is said he was killed.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Grasshopper seated himself out in the ditch, and&#10;thought and considered how things happened in the world. And he too&#10;said, &#34;Body is required! body is required!&#34; And then he sang his&#10;own melancholy song, and from that we have gathered this story,&#10;which they say is not true, though it&#39;s in print. &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Last Dream of the Old Oak'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;IN the forest, high up on the steep shore, and not far&#10;from the open seacoast, stood a very old oak-tree. It was just&#10;three hundred and sixty-five years old, but that long time was to&#10;the tree as the same number of days might be to us; we wake by day&#10;and sleep by night, and then we have our dreams. It is different&#10;with the tree; it is obliged to keep awake through three seasons of&#10;the year, and does not get any sleep till winter comes. Winter is&#10;its time for rest; its night after the long day of spring, summer,&#10;and autumn. On many a warm summer, the Ephemera, the flies that&#10;exist for only a day, had fluttered about the old oak, enjoyed life&#10;and felt happy and if, for a moment, one of the tiny creatures&#10;rested on one of his large fresh leaves, the tree would always say,&#10;&#34;Poor little creature! your whole life consists only of a single&#10;day. How very short. It must be quite melancholy.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Melancholy! what do you mean?&#34; the little creature would&#10;always reply. &#34;Everything around me is so wonderfully bright and&#10;warm, and beautiful, that it makes me joyous.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But only for one day, and then it is all&#10;over.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Over!&#34; repeated the fly; &#34;what is the meaning of all&#10;over? Are you all over too?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No; I shall very likely live for thousands of your days,&#10;and my day is whole seasons long; indeed it is so long that you&#10;could never reckon it out.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No? then I don&#39;t understand you. You may have thousands&#10;of my days, but I have thousands of moments in which I can be merry&#10;and happy. Does all the beauty of the world cease when you&#10;die?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No,&#34; replied the tree; &#34;it will certainly last much&#10;longer,&#8212;infinitely longer than I can even think of. &#34;Well, then,&#34;&#10;said the little fly, &#34;we have the same time to live; only we reckon&#10;differently.&#34; And the little creature danced and floated in the&#10;air, rejoicing in her delicate wings of gauze and velvet, rejoicing&#10;in the balmy breezes, laden with the fragrance of clover-fields and&#10;wild roses, elder-blossoms and honeysuckle, from the garden hedges,&#10;wild thyme, primroses, and mint, and the scent of all these was so&#10;strong that the perfume almost intoxicated the little fly. The long&#10;and beautiful day had been so full of joy and sweet delights, that&#10;when the sun sank low it felt tired of all its happiness and&#10;enjoyment. Its wings could sustain it no longer, and gently and&#10;slowly it glided down upon the soft waving blades of grass, nodded&#10;its little head as well as it could nod, and slept peacefully and&#10;sweetly. The fly was dead.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Poor little Ephemera!&#34; said the oak; &#34;what a terribly&#10;short life!&#34; And so, on every summer day the dance was repeated,&#10;the same questions asked, and the same answers given. The same&#10;thing was continued through many generations of Ephemera; all of&#10;them felt equally merry and equally happy.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The oak remained awake through the morning of spring, the&#10;noon of summer, and the evening of autumn; its time of rest, its&#10;night drew nigh&#8212;winter was coming. Already the storms were singing,&#10;&#34;Good-night, good-night.&#34; Here fell a leaf and there fell a leaf.&#10;&#34;We will rock you and lull you. Go to sleep, go to sleep. We will&#10;sing you to sleep, and shake you to sleep, and it will do your old&#10;twigs good; they will even crackle with pleasure. Sleep sweetly,&#10;sleep sweetly, it is your three-hundred-and-sixty-fifth night.&#10;Correctly speaking, you are but a youngster in the world. Sleep&#10;sweetly, the clouds will drop snow upon you, which will be quite a&#10;cover-lid, warm and sheltering to your feet. Sweet sleep to you,&#10;and pleasant dreams.&#34; And there stood the oak, stripped of all its&#10;leaves, left to rest during the whole of a long winter, and to&#10;dream many dreams of events that had happened in its life, as in&#10;the dreams of men. The great tree had once been small; indeed, in&#10;its cradle it had been an acorn. According to human computation, it&#10;was now in the fourth century of its existence. It was the largest&#10;and best tree in the forest. Its summit towered above all the other&#10;trees, and could be seen far out at sea, so that it served as a&#10;landmark to the sailors. It had no idea how many eyes looked&#10;eagerly for it. In its topmost branches the wood-pigeon built her&#10;nest, and the cuckoo carried out his usual vocal performances, and&#10;his well-known notes echoed amid the boughs; and in autumn, when&#10;the leaves looked like beaten copper plates, the birds of passage&#10;would come and rest upon the branches before taking their flight&#10;across the sea. But now it was winter, the tree stood leafless, so&#10;that every one could see how crooked and bent were the branches&#10;that sprang forth from the trunk. Crows and rooks came by turns and&#10;sat on them, and talked of the hard times which were beginning, and&#10;how difficult it was in winter to obtain food.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was just about holy Christmas time that the tree&#10;dreamed a dream. The tree had, doubtless, a kind of feeling that&#10;the festive time had arrived, and in his dream fancied he heard the&#10;bells ringing from all the churches round, and yet it seemed to him&#10;to be a beautiful summer&#39;s day, mild and warm. His mighty summits&#10;was crowned with spreading fresh green foliage; the sunbeams played&#10;among the leaves and branches, and the air was full of fragrance&#10;from herb and blossom; painted butterflies chased each other; the&#10;summer flies danced around him, as if the world had been created&#10;merely for them to dance and be merry in. All that had happened to&#10;the tree during every year of his life seemed to pass before him,&#10;as in a festive procession. He saw the knights of olden times and&#10;noble ladies ride by through the wood on their gallant steeds, with&#10;plumes waving in their hats, and falcons on their wrists. The&#10;hunting horn sounded, and the dogs barked. He saw hostile warriors,&#10;in colored dresses and glittering armor, with spear and halberd,&#10;pitching their tents, and anon striking them. The watchfires again&#10;blazed, and men sang and slept under the hospitable shelter of the&#10;tree. He saw lovers meet in quiet happiness near him in the&#10;moonshine, and carve the initials of their names in the&#10;grayish-green bark on his trunk. Once, but long years had&#10;intervened since then, guitars and Eolian harps had been hung on&#10;his boughs by merry travellers; now they seemed to hang there&#10;again, and he could hear their marvellous tones. The wood-pigeons&#10;cooed as if to explain the feelings of the tree, and the cuckoo&#10;called out to tell him how many summer days he had yet to live.&#10;Then it seemed as if new life was thrilling through every fibre of&#10;root and stem and leaf, rising even to the highest branches. The&#10;tree felt itself stretching and spreading out, while through the&#10;root beneath the earth ran the warm vigor of life. As he grew&#10;higher and still higher, with increased strength, his topmost&#10;boughs became broader and fuller; and in proportion to his growth,&#10;so was his self-satisfaction increased, and with it arose a joyous&#10;longing to grow higher and higher, to reach even to the warm,&#10;bright sun itself. Already had his topmost branches pierced the&#10;clouds, which floated beneath them like troops of birds of passage,&#10;or large white swans; every leaf seemed gifted with sight, as if it&#10;possessed eyes to see. The stars became visible in broad daylight,&#10;large and sparkling, like clear and gentle eyes. They recalled to&#10;the memory the well-known look in the eyes of a child, or in the&#10;eyes of lovers who had once met beneath the branches of the old&#10;oak. These were wonderful and happy moments for the old tree, full&#10;of peace and joy; and yet, amidst all this happiness, the tree felt&#10;a yearning, longing desire that all the other trees, bushes, herbs,&#10;and flowers beneath him, might be able also to rise higher, as he&#10;had done, and to see all this splendor, and experience the same&#10;happiness. The grand, majestic oak could not be quite happy in the&#10;midst of his enjoyment, while all the rest, both great and small,&#10;were not with him. And this feeling of yearning trembled through&#10;every branch, through every leaf, as warmly and fervently as if&#10;they had been the fibres of a human heart. The summit of the tree&#10;waved to and fro, and bent downwards as if in his silent longing he&#10;sought for something. Then there came to him the fragrance of&#10;thyme, followed by the more powerful scent of honeysuckle and&#10;violets; and he fancied he heard the note of the cuckoo. At length&#10;his longing was satisfied. Up through the clouds came the green&#10;summits of the forest trees, and beneath him, the oak saw them&#10;rising, and growing higher and higher. Bush and herb shot upward,&#10;and some even tore themselves up by the roots to rise more quickly.&#10;The birch-tree was the quickest of all. Like a lightning flash the&#10;slender stem shot upwards in a zigzag line, the branches spreading&#10;around it like green gauze and banners. Every native of the wood,&#10;even to the brown and feathery rushes, grew with the rest, while&#10;the birds ascended with the melody of song. On a blade of grass,&#10;that fluttered in the air like a long, green ribbon, sat a&#10;grasshopper, cleaning his wings with his legs. May beetles hummed,&#10;the bees murmured, the birds sang, each in his own way; the air was&#10;filled with the sounds of song and gladness.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But where is the little blue flower that grows by the&#10;water?&#34; asked the oak, &#34;and the purple bell-flower, and the daisy?&#34;&#10;You see the oak wanted to have them all with him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Here we are, we are here,&#34; sounded in voice and&#10;song.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But the beautiful thyme of last summer, where is that?&#10;and the lilies-of-the-valley, which last year covered the earth&#10;with their bloom? and the wild apple-tree with its lovely blossoms,&#10;and all the glory of the wood, which has flourished year after&#10;year? even what may have but now sprouted forth could be with us&#10;here.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;We are here, we are here,&#34; sounded voices higher in the&#10;air, as if they had flown there beforehand.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Why this is beautiful, too beautiful to be believed,&#34;&#10;said the oak in a joyful tone. &#34;I have them all here, both great&#10;and small; not one has been forgotten. Can such happiness be&#10;imagined?&#34; It seemed almost impossible.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;In heaven with the Eternal God, it can be imagined, and&#10;it is possible,&#34; sounded the reply through the air.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the old tree, as it still grew upwards and onwards,&#10;felt that his roots were loosening themselves from the&#10;earth.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It is right so, it is best,&#34; said the tree, &#34;no fetters&#10;hold me now. I can fly up to the very highest point in light and&#10;glory. And all I love are with me, both small and great. All&#8212;all&#10;are here.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Such was the dream of the old oak: and while he dreamed, a&#10;mighty storm came rushing over land and sea, at the holy Christmas&#10;time. The sea rolled in great billows towards the shore. There was&#10;a cracking and crushing heard in the tree. The root was torn from&#10;the ground just at the moment when in his dream he fancied it was&#10;being loosened from the earth. He fell&#8212;his three hundred and&#10;sixty-five years were passed as the single day of the Ephemera. On&#10;the morning of Christmas-day, when the sun rose, the storm had&#10;ceased. From all the churches sounded the festive bells, and from&#10;every hearth, even of the smallest hut, rose the smoke into the&#10;blue sky, like the smoke from the festive thank-offerings on the&#10;Druids&#39; altars. The sea gradually became calm, and on board a great&#10;ship that had withstood the tempest during the night, all the flags&#10;were displayed, as a token of joy and festivity. &#34;The tree is down!&#10;The old oak,&#8212;our landmark on the coast!&#34; exclaimed the sailors. &#34;It&#10;must have fallen in the storm of last night. Who can replace it?&#10;Alas! no one.&#34; This was a funeral oration over the old tree; short,&#10;but well-meant. There it lay stretched on the snow-covered shore,&#10;and over it sounded the notes of a song from the ship&#8212;a song of&#10;Christmas joy, and of the redemption of the soul of man, and of&#10;eternal life through Christ&#39;s atoning blood.&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Sing aloud on the happy morn,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;All is fulfilled, for Christ is born;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;With songs of joy let us loudly sing,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#39;Hallelujahs to Christ our King.&#39;&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Thus sounded the old Christmas carol, and every one on&#10;board the ship felt his thoughts elevated, through the song and the&#10;prayer, even as the old tree had felt lifted up in its last, its&#10;beautiful dream on that Christmas morn. &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Last Pearl'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;WE are in a rich, happy house, where the master, the&#10;servants, the friends of the family are full of joy and felicity.&#10;For on this day a son and heir has been born, and mother and child&#10;are doing well. The lamp in the bed-chamber had been partly shaded,&#10;and the windows were covered with heavy curtains of some costly&#10;silken material. The carpet was thick and soft, like a covering of&#10;moss. Everything invited to slumber, everything had a charming look&#10;of repose; and so the nurse had discovered, for she slept; and well&#10;she might sleep, while everything around her told of happiness and&#10;blessing. The guardian angel of the house leaned against the head&#10;of the bed; while over the child was spread, as it were, a net of&#10;shining stars, and each star was a pearl of happiness. All the good&#10;stars of life had brought their gifts to the newly born; here&#10;sparkled health, wealth, fortune, and love; in short, there seemed&#10;to be everything for which man could wish on earth.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Everything has been bestowed here,&#34; said the guardian&#10;angel.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No, not everything,&#34; said a voice near him&#8212;the voice of&#10;the good angel of the child; &#34;one fairy has not yet brought her&#10;gift, but she will, even if years should elapse, she will bring her&#10;gift; it is the last pearl that is wanting.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Wanting!&#34; cried the guardian angel; &#34;nothing must be&#10;wanting here; and if it is so, let us fetch it; let us seek the&#10;powerful fairy; let us go to her.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;She will come, she will come some day&#10;unsought!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Her pearl must not be missing; it must be there, that the&#10;crown, when worn, may be complete. Where is she to be found? Where&#10;does she dwell?&#34; said the guardian angel. &#34;Tell me, and I will&#10;procure the pearl.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Will you do that?&#34; replied the good angel of the child.&#10;&#34;Then I will lead you to her directly, wherever she may be. She has&#10;no abiding place; she rules in the palace of the emperor, sometimes&#10;she enters the peasant&#39;s humble cot; she passes no one without&#10;leaving a trace of her presence. She brings her gift with her,&#10;whether it is a world or a bauble. To this child she must come. You&#10;think that to wait for this time would be long and useless. Well,&#10;then, let us go for this pearl&#8212;the only one lacking amidst all this&#10;wealth.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then hand-in-hand they floated away to the spot where the&#10;fairy was now lingering. It was in a large house with dark windows&#10;and empty rooms, in which a peculiar stillness reigned. A whole row&#10;of windows stood open, so that the rude wind could enter at its&#10;pleasure, and the long white curtains waved to and fro in the&#10;current of air. In the centre of one of the rooms stood an open&#10;coffin, in which lay the body of a woman, still in the bloom of&#10;youth and very beautiful. Fresh roses were scattered over her. The&#10;delicate folded hands and the noble face glorified in death by the&#10;solemn, earnest look, which spoke of an entrance into a better&#10;world, were alone visible. Around the coffin stood the husband and&#10;children, a whole troop, the youngest in the father&#39;s arms. They&#10;were come to take a last farewell look of their mother. The husband&#10;kissed her hand, which now lay like a withered leaf, but which a&#10;short time before had been diligently employed in deeds of love for&#10;them all. Tears of sorrow rolled down their cheeks, and fell in&#10;heavy drops on the floor, but not a word was spoken. The silence&#10;which reigned here expressed a world of grief. With silent steps,&#10;still sobbing, they left the room. A burning light remained in the&#10;room, and a long, red wick rose far above the flame, which&#10;fluttered in the draught of air. Strange men came in and placed the&#10;lid of the coffin over the dead, and drove the nails firmly in;&#10;while the blows of the hammer resounded through the house, and&#10;echoed in the hearts that were bleeding.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Whither art thou leading me?&#34; asked the guardian angel.&#10;&#34;Here dwells no fairy whose pearl could be counted amongst the best&#10;gifts of life.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, she is here; here in this sacred hour,&#34; replied the&#10;angel, pointing to a corner of the room; and there,&#8212;where in her&#10;life-time, the mother had taken her seat amidst flowers and&#10;pictures: in that spot, where she, like the blessed fairy of the&#10;house, had welcomed husband, children, and friends, and, like a&#10;sunbeam, had spread joy and cheerfulness around her, the centre and&#10;heart of them all,&#8212;there, in that very spot, sat a strange woman,&#10;clothed in long, flowing garments, and occupying the place of the&#10;dead wife and mother. It was the fairy, and her name was &#34;Sorrow.&#34;&#10;A hot tear rolled into her lap, and formed itself into a pearl,&#10;glowing with all the colors of the rainbow. The angel seized it:&#10;the, pearl glittered like a star with seven-fold radiance. The&#10;pearl of Sorrow, the last, which must not be wanting, increases the&#10;lustre, and explains the meaning of all the other&#10;pearls.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Do you see the shimmer of the rainbow, which unites earth&#10;to heaven?&#34; So has there been a bridge built between this world and&#10;the next. Through the night of the grave we gaze upwards beyond the&#10;stars to the end of all things. Then we glance at the pearl of&#10;Sorrow, in which are concealed the wings which shall carry us away&#10;to eternal happiness. &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;Little Claus and Big Claus'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;IN a village there once lived two men who had the same&#10;name. They were both called Claus. One of them had four horses, but&#10;the other had only one; so to distinguish them, people called the&#10;owner of the four horses, &#34;Great Claus,&#34; and he who had only one,&#10;&#34;Little Claus.&#34; Now we shall hear what happened to them, for this&#10;is a true story.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Through the whole week, Little Claus was obliged to plough&#10;for Great Claus, and lend him his one horse; and once a week, on a&#10;Sunday, Great Claus lent him all his four horses. Then how Little&#10;Claus would smack his whip over all five horses, they were as good&#10;as his own on that one day. The sun shone brightly, and the church&#10;bells were ringing merrily as the people passed by, dressed in&#10;their best clothes, with their prayer-books under their arms. They&#10;were going to hear the clergyman preach. They looked at Little&#10;Claus ploughing with his five horses, and he was so proud that he&#10;smacked his whip, and said, &#34;Gee-up, my five horses.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You must not say that,&#34; said Big Claus; &#34;for only one of&#10;them belongs to you.&#34; But Little Claus soon forgot what he ought to&#10;say, and when any one passed he would call out, &#34;Gee-up, my five&#10;horses!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Now I must beg you not to say that again,&#34; said Big&#10;Claus; &#34;for if you do, I shall hit your horse on the head, so that&#10;he will drop dead on the spot, and there will be an end of&#10;him.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I promise you I will not say it any more,&#34; said the&#10;other; but as soon as people came by, nodding to him, and wishing&#10;him &#34;Good day,&#34; he became so pleased, and thought how grand it&#10;looked to have five horses ploughing in his field, that he cried&#10;out again, &#34;Gee-up, all my horses!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I&#39;ll gee-up your horses for you,&#34; said Big Claus; and&#10;seizing a hammer, he struck the one horse of Little Claus on the&#10;head, and he fell dead instantly.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, now I have no horse at all, said Little Claus,&#10;weeping. But after a while he took off the dead horse&#39;s skin, and&#10;hung the hide to dry in the wind. Then he put the dry skin into a&#10;bag, and, placing it over his shoulder, went out into the next town&#10;to sell the horse&#39;s skin. He had a very long way to go, and had to&#10;pass through a dark, gloomy forest. Presently a storm arose, and he&#10;lost his way, and before he discovered the right path, evening came&#10;on, and it was still a long way to the town, and too far to return&#10;home before night. Near the road stood a large farmhouse. The&#10;shutters outside the windows were closed, but lights shone through&#10;the crevices at the top. &#34;I might get permission to stay here for&#10;the night,&#34; thought Little Claus; so he went up to the door and&#10;knocked. The farmer&#39;s wife opened the door; but when she heard what&#10;he wanted, she told him to go away, as her husband would not allow&#10;her to admit strangers. &#34;Then I shall be obliged to lie out here,&#34;&#10;said Little Claus to himself, as the farmer&#39;s wife shut the door in&#10;his face. Near to the farmhouse stood a large haystack, and between&#10;it and the house was a small shed, with a thatched roof. &#34;I can lie&#10;up there,&#34; said Little Claus, as he saw the roof; &#34;it will make a&#10;famous bed, but I hope the stork will not fly down and bite my&#10;legs;&#34; for on it stood a living stork, whose nest was in the roof.&#10;So Little Claus climbed to the roof of the shed, and while he&#10;turned himself to get comfortable, he discovered that the wooden&#10;shutters, which were closed, did not reach to the tops of the&#10;windows of the farmhouse, so that he could see into a room, in&#10;which a large table was laid out with wine, roast meat, and a&#10;splendid fish. The farmer&#39;s wife and the sexton were sitting at the&#10;table together; and she filled his glass, and helped him&#10;plenteously to fish, which appeared to be his favorite dish. &#34;If I&#10;could only get some, too,&#34; thought Little Claus; and then, as he&#10;stretched his neck towards the window he spied a large, beautiful&#10;pie,&#8212;indeed they had a glorious feast before them.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;At this moment he heard some one riding down the road,&#10;towards the farmhouse. It was the farmer returning home. He was a&#10;good man, but still he had a very strange prejudice,&#8212;he could not&#10;bear the sight of a sexton. If one appeared before him, he would&#10;put himself in a terrible rage. In consequence of this dislike, the&#10;sexton had gone to visit the farmer&#39;s wife during her husband&#39;s&#10;absence from home, and the good woman had placed before him the&#10;best she had in the house to eat. When she heard the farmer coming&#10;she was frightened, and begged the sexton to hide himself in a&#10;large empty chest that stood in the room. He did so, for he knew&#10;her husband could not endure the sight of a sexton. The woman then&#10;quickly put away the wine, and hid all the rest of the nice things&#10;in the oven; for if her husband had seen them he would have asked&#10;what they were brought out for.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, dear,&#34; sighed Little Claus from the top of the shed,&#10;as he saw all the good things disappear.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Is any one up there?&#34; asked the farmer, looking up and&#10;discovering Little Claus. &#34;Why are you lying up there? Come down,&#10;and come into the house with me.&#34; So Little Claus came down and&#10;told the farmer how he had lost his way and begged for a night&#39;s&#10;lodging.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;All right,&#34; said the farmer; &#34;but we must have something&#10;to eat first.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The woman received them both very kindly, laid the cloth&#10;on a large table, and placed before them a dish of porridge. The&#10;farmer was very hungry, and ate his porridge with a good appetite,&#10;but Little Claus could not help thinking of the nice roast meat,&#10;fish and pies, which he knew were in the oven. Under the table, at&#10;his feet, lay the sack containing the horse&#39;s skin, which he&#10;intended to sell at the next town. Now Little Claus did not relish&#10;the porridge at all, so he trod with his foot on the sack under the&#10;table, and the dry skin squeaked quite loud. &#34;Hush!&#34; said Little&#10;Claus to his sack, at the same time treading upon it again, till it&#10;squeaked louder than before.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Hallo! what have you got in your sack!&#34; asked the&#10;farmer.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, it is a conjuror,&#34; said Little Claus; &#34;and he says we&#10;need not eat porridge, for he has conjured the oven full of roast&#10;meat, fish, and pie.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Wonderful!&#34; cried the farmer, starting up and opening the&#10;oven door; and there lay all the nice things hidden by the farmer&#39;s&#10;wife, but which he supposed had been conjured there by the wizard&#10;under the table. The woman dared not say anything; so she placed&#10;the things before them, and they both ate of the fish, the meat,&#10;and the pastry.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then Little Claus trod again upon his sack, and it&#10;squeaked as before. &#34;What does he say now?&#34; asked the&#10;farmer.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;He says,&#34; replied Little Claus, &#34;that there are three&#10;bottles of wine for us, standing in the corner, by the&#10;oven.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;So the woman was obliged to bring out the wine also, which&#10;she had hidden, and the farmer drank it till he became quite merry.&#10;He would have liked such a conjuror as Little Claus carried in his&#10;sack. &#34;Could he conjure up the evil one?&#34; asked the farmer. &#34;I&#10;should like to see him now, while I am so merry.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, yes!&#34; replied Little Claus, &#34;my conjuror can do&#10;anything I ask him,&#8212;can you not?&#34; he asked, treading at the same&#10;time on the sack till it squeaked. &#34;Do you hear? he answers &#39;Yes,&#39;&#10;but he fears that we shall not like to look at him.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, I am not afraid. What will he be like?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Well, he is very much like a sexton.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ha!&#34; said the farmer, &#34;then he must be ugly. Do you know&#10;I cannot endure the sight of a sexton. However, that doesn&#39;t&#10;matter, I shall know who it is; so I shall not mind. Now then, I&#10;have got up my courage, but don&#39;t let him come too near&#10;me.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Stop, I must ask the conjuror,&#34; said Little Claus; so he&#10;trod on the bag, and stooped his ear down to listen.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What does he say?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;He says that you must go and open that large chest which&#10;stands in the corner, and you will see the evil one crouching down&#10;inside; but you must hold the lid firmly, that he may not slip&#10;out.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Will you come and help me hold it?&#34; said the farmer,&#10;going towards the chest in which his wife had hidden the sexton,&#10;who now lay inside, very much frightened. The farmer opened the lid&#10;a very little way, and peeped in.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh,&#34; cried he, springing backwards, &#34;I saw him, and he is&#10;exactly like our sexton. How dreadful it is!&#34; So after that he was&#10;obliged to drink again, and they sat and drank till far into the&#10;night.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You must sell your conjuror to me,&#34; said the farmer; &#34;ask&#10;as much as you like, I will pay it; indeed I would give you&#10;directly a whole bushel of gold.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No, indeed, I cannot,&#34; said Little Claus; &#34;only think how&#10;much profit I could make out of this conjuror.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But I should like to have him,&#34; said the fanner, still&#10;continuing his entreaties.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Well,&#34; said Little Claus at length, &#34;you have been so&#10;good as to give me a night&#39;s lodging, I will not refuse you; you&#10;shall have the conjuror for a bushel of money, but I will have&#10;quite full measure.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;So you shall,&#34; said the farmer; &#34;but you must take away&#10;the chest as well. I would not have it in the house another hour;&#10;there is no knowing if he may not be still there.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;So Little Claus gave the farmer the sack containing the&#10;dried horse&#39;s skin, and received in exchange a bushel of money&#8212;full&#10;measure. The farmer also gave him a wheelbarrow on which to carry&#10;away the chest and the gold.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Farewell,&#34; said Little Claus, as he went off with his&#10;money and the great chest, in which the sexton lay still concealed.&#10;On one side of the forest was a broad, deep river, the water flowed&#10;so rapidly that very few were able to swim against the stream. A&#10;new bridge had lately been built across it, and in the middle of&#10;this bridge Little Claus stopped, and said, loud enough to be heard&#10;by the sexton, &#34;Now what shall I do with this stupid chest; it is&#10;as heavy as if it were full of stones: I shall be tired if I roll&#10;it any farther, so I may as well throw it in the river; if it swims&#10;after me to my house, well and good, and if not, it will not much&#10;matter.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;So he seized the chest in his hand and lifted it up a&#10;little, as if he were going to throw it into the water.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No, leave it alone,&#34; cried the sexton from within the&#10;chest; &#34;let me out first.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh,&#34; exclaimed Little Claus, pretending to be frightened,&#10;&#34;he is in there still, is he? I must throw him into the river, that&#10;he may be drowned.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, no; oh, no,&#34; cried the sexton; &#34;I will give you a&#10;whole bushel full of money if you will let me go.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Why, that is another matter,&#34; said Little Claus, opening&#10;the chest. The sexton crept out, pushed the empty chest into the&#10;water, and went to his house, then he measured out a whole bushel&#10;full of gold for Little Claus, who had already received one from&#10;the farmer, so that now he had a barrow full.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I have been well paid for my horse,&#34; said he to himself&#10;when he reached home, entered his own room, and emptied all his&#10;money into a heap on the floor. &#34;How vexed Great Claus will be when&#10;he finds out how rich I have become all through my one horse; but I&#10;shall not tell him exactly how it all happened.&#34; Then he sent a boy&#10;to Great Claus to borrow a bushel measure.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What can he want it for?&#34; thought Great Claus; so he&#10;smeared the bottom of the measure with tar, that some of whatever&#10;was put into it might stick there and remain. And so it happened;&#10;for when the measure returned, three new silver florins were&#10;sticking to it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What does this mean?&#34; said Great Claus; so he ran off&#10;directly to Little Claus, and asked, &#34;Where did you get so much&#10;money?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, for my horse&#39;s skin, I sold it yesterday.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It was certainly well paid for then,&#34; said Great Claus;&#10;and he ran home to his house, seized a hatchet, and knocked all his&#10;four horses on the head, flayed off their skins, and took them to&#10;the town to sell. &#34;Skins, skins, who&#39;ll buy skins?&#34; he cried, as he&#10;went through the streets. All the shoemakers and tanners came&#10;running, and asked how much he wanted for them.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;A bushel of money, for each,&#34; replied Great&#10;Claus.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Are you mad?&#34; they all cried; &#34;do you think we have money&#10;to spend by the bushel?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Skins, skins,&#34; he cried again, &#34;who&#39;ll buy skins?&#34; but to&#10;all who inquired the price, his answer was, &#34;a bushel of&#10;money.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;He is making fools of us,&#34; said they all; then the&#10;shoemakers took their straps, and the tanners their leather aprons,&#10;and began to beat Great Claus.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Skins, skins!&#34; they cried, mocking him; &#34;yes, we&#39;ll mark&#10;your skin for you, till it is black and blue.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Out of the town with him,&#34; said they. And Great Claus was&#10;obliged to run as fast as he could, he had never before been so&#10;thoroughly beaten.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ah,&#34; said he, as he came to his house; &#34;Little Claus&#10;shall pay me for this; I will beat him to death.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Meanwhile the old grandmother of Little Claus died. She&#10;had been cross, unkind, and really spiteful to him; but he was very&#10;sorry, and took the dead woman and laid her in his warm bed to see&#10;if he could bring her to life again. There he determined that she&#10;should lie the whole night, while he seated himself in a chair in a&#10;corner of the room as he had often done before. During the night,&#10;as he sat there, the door opened, and in came Great Claus with a&#10;hatchet. He knew well where Little Claus&#39;s bed stood; so he went&#10;right up to it, and struck the old grandmother on the head.&#10;thinking it must be Little Claus.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;There,&#34; cried he, &#34;now you cannot make a fool of me&#10;again;&#34; and then he went home.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That is a very wicked man,&#34; thought Little Claus; &#34;he&#10;meant to kill me. It is a good thing for my old grandmother that&#10;she was already dead, or he would have taken her life.&#34; Then he&#10;dressed his old grandmother in her best clothes, borrowed a horse&#10;of his neighbor, and harnessed it to a cart. Then he placed the old&#10;woman on the back seat, so that she might not fall out as he drove,&#10;and rode away through the wood. By sunrise they reached a large&#10;inn, where Little Claus stopped and went to get something to eat.&#10;The landlord was a rich man, and a good man too; but as passionate&#10;as if he had been made of pepper and snuff.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Good morning,&#34; said he to Little Claus; &#34;you are come&#10;betimes to-day.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes,&#34; said Little Claus; &#34;I am going to the town with my&#10;old grandmother; she is sitting at the back of the wagon, but I&#10;cannot bring her into the room. Will you take her a glass of mead?&#10;but you must speak very loud, for she cannot hear well.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, certainly I will,&#34; replied the landlord; and,&#10;pouring out a glass of mead, he carried it out to the dead&#10;grandmother, who sat upright in the cart. &#34;Here is a glass of mead&#10;from your grandson,&#34; said the landlord. The dead woman did not&#10;answer a word, but sat quite still. &#34;Do you not hear?&#34; cried the&#10;landlord as loud as he could; &#34;here is a glass of mead from your&#10;grandson.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Again and again he bawled it out, but as she did not stir&#10;he flew into a passion, and threw the glass of mead in her face; it&#10;struck her on the nose, and she fell backwards out of the cart, for&#10;she was only seated there, not tied in.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Hallo!&#34; cried Little Claus, rushing out of the door, and&#10;seizing hold of the landlord by the throat; &#34;you have killed my&#10;grandmother; see, here is a great hole in her forehead.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, how unfortunate,&#34; said the landlord, wringing his&#10;hands. &#34;This all comes of my fiery temper. Dear Little Claus, I&#10;will give you a bushel of money; I will bury your grandmother as if&#10;she were my own; only keep silent, or else they will cut off my&#10;head, and that would be disagreeable.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;So it happened that Little Claus received another bushel&#10;of money, and the landlord buried his old grandmother as if she had&#10;been his own. When Little Claus reached home again, he immediately&#10;sent a boy to Great Claus, requesting him to lend him a bushel&#10;measure. &#34;How is this?&#34; thought Great Claus; &#34;did I not kill him? I&#10;must go and see for myself.&#34; So he went to Little Claus, and took&#10;the bushel measure with him. &#34;How did you get all this money?&#34;&#10;asked Great Claus, staring with wide open eyes at his neighbor&#39;s&#10;treasures.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You killed my grandmother instead of me,&#34; said Little&#10;Claus; &#34;so I have sold her for a bushel of money.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That is a good price at all events,&#34; said Great Claus. So&#10;he went home, took a hatchet, and killed his old grandmother with&#10;one blow. Then he placed her on a cart, and drove into the town to&#10;the apothecary, and asked him if he would buy a dead&#10;body.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Whose is it, and where did you get it?&#34; asked the&#10;apothecary.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It is my grandmother,&#34; he replied; &#34;I killed her with a&#10;blow, that I might get a bushel of money for her.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Heaven preserve us!&#34; cried the apothecary, &#34;you are out&#10;of your mind. Don&#39;t say such things, or you will lose your head.&#34;&#10;And then he talked to him seriously about the wicked deed he had&#10;done, and told him that such a wicked man would surely be punished.&#10;Great Claus got so frightened that he rushed out of the surgery,&#10;jumped into the cart, whipped up his horses, and drove home&#10;quickly. The apothecary and all the people thought him mad, and let&#10;him drive where he liked.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You shall pay for this,&#34; said Great Claus, as soon as he&#10;got into the highroad, &#34;that you shall, Little Claus.&#34; So as soon&#10;as he reached home he took the largest sack he could find and went&#10;over to Little Claus. &#34;You have played me another trick,&#34; said he.&#10;&#34;First, I killed all my horses, and then my old grandmother, and it&#10;is all your fault; but you shall not make a fool of me any more.&#34;&#10;So he laid hold of Little Claus round the body, and pushed him into&#10;the sack, which he took on his shoulders, saying, &#34;Now I&#39;m going to&#10;drown you in the river.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;He had a long way to go before he reached the river, and&#10;Little Claus was not a very light weight to carry. The road led by&#10;the church, and as they passed he could hear the organ playing and&#10;the people singing beautifully. Great Claus put down the sack close&#10;to the church-door, and thought he might as well go in and hear a&#10;psalm before he went any farther. Little Claus could not possibly&#10;get out of the sack, and all the people were in church; so in he&#10;went.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh dear, oh dear,&#34; sighed Little Claus in the sack, as he&#10;turned and twisted about; but he found he could not loosen the&#10;string with which it was tied. Presently an old cattle driver, with&#10;snowy hair, passed by, carrying a large staff in his hand, with&#10;which he drove a large herd of cows and oxen before him. They&#10;stumbled against the sack in which lay Little Claus, and turned it&#10;over. &#34;Oh dear,&#34; sighed Little Claus, &#34;I am very young, yet I am&#10;soon going to heaven.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And I, poor fellow,&#34; said the drover, &#34;I who am so old&#10;already, cannot get there.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Open the sack,&#34; cried Little Claus; &#34;creep into it&#10;instead of me, and you will soon be there.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;With all my heart,&#34; replied the drover, opening the sack,&#10;from which sprung Little Claus as quickly as possible. &#34;Will you&#10;take care of my cattle?&#34; said the old man, as he crept into the&#10;bag.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes,&#34; said Little Claus, and he tied up the sack, and&#10;then walked off with all the cows and oxen.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;When Great Claus came out of church, he took up the sack,&#10;and placed it on his shoulders. It appeared to have become lighter,&#10;for the old drover was not half so heavy as Little&#10;Claus.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;How light he seems now,&#34; said he. &#34;Ah, it is because I&#10;have been to a church.&#34; So he walked on to the river, which was&#10;deep and broad, and threw the sack containing the old drover into&#10;the water, believing it to be Little Claus. &#34;There you may lie!&#34; he&#10;exclaimed; &#34;you will play me no more tricks now.&#34; Then he turned to&#10;go home, but when he came to a place where two roads crossed, there&#10;was Little Claus driving the cattle. &#34;How is this?&#34; said Great&#10;Claus. &#34;Did I not drown you just now?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes,&#34; said Little Claus; &#34;you threw me into the river&#10;about half an hour ago.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But wherever did you get all these fine beasts?&#34; asked&#10;Great Claus.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;These beasts are sea-cattle,&#34; replied Little Claus. &#34;I&#39;ll&#10;tell you the whole story, and thank you for drowning me; I am above&#10;you now, I am really very rich. I was frightened, to be sure, while&#10;I lay tied up in the sack, and the wind whistled in my ears when&#10;you threw me into the river from the bridge, and I sank to the&#10;bottom immediately; but I did not hurt myself, for I fell upon&#10;beautifully soft grass which grows down there; and in a moment, the&#10;sack opened, and the sweetest little maiden came towards me. She&#10;had snow-white robes, and a wreath of green leaves on her wet hair.&#10;She took me by the hand, and said, &#39;So you are come, Little Claus,&#10;and here are some cattle for you to begin with. About a mile&#10;farther on the road, there is another herd for you.&#39; Then I saw&#10;that the river formed a great highway for the people who live in&#10;the sea. They were walking and driving here and there from the sea&#10;to the land at the, spot where the river terminates. The bed of the&#10;river was covered with the loveliest flowers and sweet fresh grass.&#10;The fish swam past me as rapidly as the birds do here in the air.&#10;How handsome all the people were, and what fine cattle were grazing&#10;on the hills and in the valleys!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But why did you come up again,&#34; said Great Claus, &#34;if it&#10;was all so beautiful down there? I should not have done&#10;so?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Well,&#34; said Little Claus, &#34;it was good policy on my part;&#10;you heard me say just now that I was told by the sea-maiden to go a&#10;mile farther on the road, and I should find a whole herd of cattle.&#10;By the road she meant the river, for she could not travel any other&#10;way; but I knew the winding of the river, and how it bends,&#10;sometimes to the right and sometimes to the left, and it seemed a&#10;long way, so I chose a shorter one; and, by coming up to the land,&#10;and then driving across the fields back again to the river, I shall&#10;save half a mile, and get all my cattle more quickly.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What a lucky fellow you are!&#34; exclaimed Great Claus. &#34;Do&#10;you think I should get any sea-cattle if I went down to the bottom&#10;of the river?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, I think so,&#34; said Little Claus; &#34;but I cannot carry&#10;you there in a sack, you are too heavy. However if you will go&#10;there first, and then creep into a sack, I will throw you in with&#10;the greatest pleasure.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Thank you,&#34; said Great Claus; &#34;but remember, if I do not&#10;get any sea-cattle down there I shall come up again and give you a&#10;good thrashing.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No, now, don&#39;t be too fierce about it!&#34; said Little&#10;Claus, as they walked on towards the river. When they approached&#10;it, the cattle, who were very thirsty, saw the stream, and ran down&#10;to drink.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;See what a hurry they are in,&#34; said Little Claus, &#34;they&#10;are longing to get down again,&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Come, help me, make haste,&#34; said Great Claus; &#34;or you&#39;ll&#10;get beaten.&#34; So he crept into a large sack, which had been lying&#10;across the back of one of the oxen.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Put in a stone,&#34; said Great Claus, &#34;or I may not&#10;sink.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, there&#39;s not much fear of that,&#34; he replied; still he&#10;put a large stone into the bag, and then tied it tightly, and gave&#10;it a push.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Plump!&#34; In went Great Claus, and immediately sank to the&#10;bottom of the river.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I&#39;m afraid he will not find any cattle,&#34; said Little&#10;Claus, and then he drove his own beasts homewards.&#10;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Little Elder-Tree Mother'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;THERE was once a little boy who had caught cold; he had&#10;gone out and got wet feet. Nobody had the least idea how it had&#10;happened; the weather was quite dry. His mother undressed him, put&#10;him to bed, and ordered the teapot to be brought in, that she might&#10;make him a good cup of tea from the elder-tree blossoms, which is&#10;so warming. At the same time, the kind-hearted old man who lived by&#10;himself in the upper storey of the house came in; he led a lonely&#10;life, for he had no wife and children; but he loved the children of&#10;others very much, and he could tell so many fairy tales and&#10;stories, that it was a pleasure to hear him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Now, drink your tea,&#34; said the mother; &#34;perhaps you will&#10;hear a story.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, if I only knew a fresh one,&#34; said the old man, and&#10;nodded smilingly. &#34;But how did the little fellow get his wet feet?&#34;&#10;he then asked.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That,&#34; replied the mother, &#34;nobody can&#10;understand.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Will you tell me a story?&#34; asked the boy.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, if you can tell me as nearly as possible how deep is&#10;the gutter in the little street where you go to school.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Just half as high as my top-boots,&#34; replied the boy; &#34;but&#10;then I must stand in the deepest holes.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;There, now we know where you got your wet feet,&#34; said the&#10;old man. &#34;I ought to tell you a story, but the worst of it is, I do&#10;not know any more.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You can make one up,&#34; said the little boy. &#34;Mother says&#10;you can tell a fairy tale about anything you look at or&#10;touch.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That is all very well, but such tales or stories are&#10;worth nothing! No, the right ones come by themselves and knock at&#10;my forehead saying: &#39;Here I am.&#39;&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Will not one knock soon?&#34; asked the boy; and the mother&#10;smiled while she put elder-tree blossoms into the teapot and poured&#10;boiling water over them. &#34;Pray, tell me a story.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, if stories came by themselves; they are so proud,&#10;they only come when they please.&#8212;But wait,&#34; he said suddenly,&#10;&#34;there is one. Look at the teapot; there is a story in it&#10;now.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the little boy looked at the teapot; the lid rose up&#10;gradually, the elder-tree blossoms sprang forth one by one, fresh&#10;and white; long boughs came forth; even out of the spout they grew&#10;up in all directions, and formed a bush&#8212;nay, a large elder tree,&#10;which stretched its branches up to the bed and pushed the curtains&#10;aside; and there were so many blossoms and such a sweet fragrance!&#10;In the midst of the tree sat a kindly-looking old woman with a&#10;strange dress; it was as green as the leaves, and trimmed with&#10;large white blossoms, so that it was difficult to say whether it&#10;was real cloth, or the leaves and blossoms of the&#10;elder-tree.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What is this woman&#39;s name?&#34; asked the little&#10;boy.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Well, the Romans and Greeks used to call her a Dryad,&#34;&#10;said the old man; &#34;but we do not understand that. Out in the&#10;sailors&#39; quarter they give her a better name; there she is called&#10;elder-tree mother. Now, you must attentively listen to her and look&#10;at the beautiful elder-tree.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Just such a large tree, covered with flowers, stands out&#10;there; it grew in the corner of an humble little yard; under this&#10;tree sat two old people one afternoon in the beautiful sunshine. He&#10;was an old, old sailor, and she his old wife; they had already&#10;great-grandchildren, and were soon to celebrate their golden&#10;wedding, but they could not remember the date, and the elder-tree&#10;mother was sitting in the tree and looked as pleased as this one&#10;here. &#39;I know very well when the golden wedding is to take place,&#39;&#10;she said; but they did not hear it&#8212;they were talking of bygone&#10;days.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;Well, do you remember?&#39; said the old sailor, &#39;when we&#10;were quite small and used to run about and play&#8212;it was in the very&#10;same yard where we now are&#8212;we used to put little branches into the&#10;ground and make a garden.&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;Yes,&#39; said the old woman, &#39;I remember it very well; we&#10;used to water the branches, and one of them, an elder-tree branch,&#10;took root, and grew and became the large tree under which we are&#10;now sitting as old people.&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;Certainly, you are right,&#39; he said; &#39;and in yonder&#10;corner stood a large water-tub; there I used to sail my boat, which&#10;I had cut out myself&#8212;it sailed so well; but soon I had to sail&#10;somewhere else.&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;But first we went to school to learn something,&#39; she&#10;said, &#39;and then we were confirmed; we both wept on that day, but in&#10;the afternoon we went out hand in hand, and ascended the high round&#10;tower and looked out into the wide world right over Copenhagen and&#10;the sea; then we walked to Fredericksburg, where the king and the&#10;queen were sailing about in their magnificent boat on the&#10;canals.&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;But soon I had to sail about somewhere else, and for&#10;many years I was travelling about far away from home.&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;And I often cried about you, for I was afraid lest you&#10;were drowned and lying at the bottom of the sea. Many a time I got&#10;up in the night and looked if the weathercock had turned; it turned&#10;often, but you did not return. I remember one day distinctly: the&#10;rain was pouring down in torrents; the dust-man had come to the&#10;house where I was in service; I went down with the dust-bin and&#10;stood for a moment in the doorway, and looked at the dreadful&#10;weather. Then the postman gave me a letter; it was from you.&#10;Heavens! how that letter had travelled about. I tore it open and&#10;read it; I cried and laughed at the same time, and was so happy!&#10;Therein was written that you were staying in the hot countries,&#10;where the coffee grows. These must be marvellous countries. You&#10;said a great deal about them, and I read all while the rain was&#10;pouring down and I was standing there with the dust-bin. Then&#10;suddenly some one put his arm round my waist-&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;Yes, and you gave him a hearty smack on the cheek,&#39; said&#10;the old man.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;I did not know that it was you&#8212;you had come as quickly&#10;as your letter; and you looked so handsome, and so you do still.&#10;You had a large yellow silk handkerchief in your pocket and a&#10;shining hat on. You looked so well, and the weather in the street&#10;was horrible!&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;Then we married,&#39; he said. &#39;Do you remember how we got&#10;our first boy, and then Mary, Niels, Peter, John, and&#10;Christian?&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#39;Oh yes; and now they have all grown up, and have become&#10;useful members of society, whom everybody cares for.&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;And their children have had children again,&#39; said the&#10;old sailor. &#39;Yes, these are children&#39;s children, and they are&#10;strong and healthy. If I am not mistaken, our wedding took place at&#10;this season of the year.&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;Yes, to-day is your golden wedding-day,&#39; said the little&#10;elder-tree mother, stretching her head down between the two old&#10;people, who thought that she was their neighbour who was nodding to&#10;them; they looked at each other and clasped hands. Soon afterwards&#10;the children and grandchildren came, for they knew very well that&#10;it was the golden wedding-day; they had already wished them joy and&#10;happiness in the morning, but the old people had forgotten it,&#10;although they remembered things so well that had passed many, many&#10;years ago. The elder-tree smelt strongly, and the setting sun&#10;illuminated the faces of the two old people, so that they looked&#10;quite rosy; the youngest of the grandchildren danced round them,&#10;and cried merrily that there would be a feast in the evening, for&#10;they were to have hot potatoes; and the elder mother nodded in the&#10;tree and cried &#39;Hooray&#39; with the others.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But that was no fairy tale,&#34; said the little boy who had&#10;listened to it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You will presently understand it,&#34; said the old man who&#10;told the story. &#34;Let us ask little elder-tree mother about&#10;it.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That was no fairy tale,&#34; said the little elder-tree&#10;mother; &#34;but now it comes! Real life furnishes us with subjects for&#10;the most wonderful fairy tales; for otherwise my beautiful&#10;elder-bush could not have grown forth out of the&#10;teapot.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And then she took the little boy out of bed and placed him&#10;on her bosom; the elder branches, full of blossoms, closed over&#10;them; it was as if they sat in a thick leafy bower which flew with&#10;them through the air; it was beautiful beyond all description. The&#10;little elder-tree mother had suddenly become a charming young girl,&#10;but her dress was still of the same green material, covered with&#10;white blossoms, as the elder-tree mother had worn; she had a real&#10;elder blossom on her bosom, and a wreath of the same flowers was&#10;wound round her curly golden hair; her eyes were so large and so&#10;blue that it was wonderful to look at them. She and the boy kissed&#10;each other, and then they were of the same age and felt the same&#10;joys. They walked hand in hand out of the bower, and now stood at&#10;home in a beautiful flower garden. Near the green lawn the father&#39;s&#10;walking-stick was tied to a post. There was life in this stick for&#10;the little ones, for as soon as they seated themselves upon it the&#10;polished knob turned into a neighing horse&#39;s head, a long black&#10;mane was fluttering in the wind, and four strong slender legs grew&#10;out. The animal was fiery and spirited; they galloped round the&#10;lawn. &#34;Hooray! now we shall ride far away, many miles!&#34; said the&#10;boy; &#34;we shall ride to the nobleman&#39;s estate where we were last&#10;year.&#34; And they rode round the lawn again, and the little girl,&#10;who, as we know, was no other than the little elder-tree mother,&#10;continually cried, &#34;Now we are in the country! Do you see the&#10;farmhouse there, with the large baking stove, which projects like a&#10;gigantic egg out of the wall into the road? The elder-tree spreads&#10;its branches over it, and the cock struts about and scratches for&#10;the hens. Look how proud he is! Now we are near the church; it&#10;stands on a high hill, under the spreading oak trees; one of them&#10;is half dead! Now we are at the smithy, where the fire roars and&#10;the half-naked men beat with their hammers so that the sparks fly&#10;far and wide. Let&#39;s be off to the beautiful farm!&#34; And they passed&#10;by everything the little girl, who was sitting behind on the stick,&#10;described, and the boy saw it, and yet they only went round the&#10;lawn. Then they played in a side-walk, and marked out a little&#10;garden on the ground; she took elder-blossoms out of her hair and&#10;planted them, and they grew exactly like those the old people&#10;planted when they were children, as we have heard before. They&#10;walked about hand in hand, just as the old couple had done when&#10;they were little, but they did not go to the round tower nor to the&#10;Fredericksburg garden. No; the little girl seized the boy round the&#10;waist, and then they flew far into the country. It was spring and&#10;it became summer, it was autumn and it became winter, and thousands&#10;of pictures reflected themselves in the boy&#39;s eyes and heart, and&#10;the little girl always sang again, &#34;You will never forget that!&#34;&#10;And during their whole flight the elder-tree smelt so sweetly; he&#10;noticed the roses and the fresh beeches, but the elder-tree smelt&#10;much stronger, for the flowers were fixed on the little girl&#39;s&#10;bosom, against which the boy often rested his head during the&#10;flight.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It is beautiful here in spring,&#34; said the little girl,&#10;and they were again in the green beechwood, where the thyme&#10;breathed forth sweet fragrance at their feet, and the pink anemones&#10;looked lovely in the green moss. &#34;Oh! that it were always spring in&#10;the fragrant beechwood!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Here it is splendid in summer!&#34; she said, and they passed&#10;by old castles of the age of chivalry. The high walls and indented&#10;battlements were reflected in the water of the ditches, on which&#10;swans were swimming and peering into the old shady avenues. The&#10;corn waved in the field like a yellow sea. Red and yellow flowers&#10;grew in the ditches, wild hops and convolvuli in full bloom in the&#10;hedges. In the evening the moon rose, large and round, and the&#10;hayricks in the meadows smelt sweetly. &#34;One can never forget&#10;it!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Here it is beautiful in autumn!&#34; said the little girl,&#10;and the atmosphere seemed twice as high and blue, while the wood&#10;shone with crimson, green, and gold. The hounds were running off,&#10;flocks of wild fowl flew screaming over the barrows, while the&#10;bramble bushes twined round the old stones. The dark-blue sea was&#10;covered with white-sailed ships, and in the barns sat old women,&#10;girls, and children picking hops into a large tub; the young ones&#10;sang songs, and the old people told fairy tales about goblins and&#10;sorcerers. It could not be more pleasant anywhere.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Here it&#39;s agreeable in winter!&#34; said the little girl, and&#10;all the trees were covered with hoar-frost, so that they looked&#10;like white coral. The snow creaked under one&#39;s feet, as if one had&#10;new boots on. One shooting star after another traversed the sky. In&#10;the room the Christmas tree was lit, and there were song and&#10;merriment. In the peasant&#39;s cottage the violin sounded, and games&#10;were played for apple quarters; even the poorest child said, &#34;It is&#10;beautiful in winter!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And indeed it was beautiful! And the little girl showed&#10;everything to the boy, and the elder-tree continued to breathe&#10;forth sweet perfume, while the red flag with the white cross was&#10;streaming in the wind; it was the flag under which the old sailor&#10;had served. The boy became a youth; he was to go out into the wide&#10;world, far away to the countries where the coffee grows. But at&#10;parting the little girl took an elder-blossom from her breast and&#10;gave it to him as a keepsake. He placed it in his prayer-book, and&#10;when he opened it in distant lands it was always at the place where&#10;the flower of remembrance was lying; and the more he looked at it&#10;the fresher it became, so that he could almost smell the fragrance&#10;of the woods at home. He distinctly saw the little girl, with her&#10;bright blue eyes, peeping out from behind the petals, and heard her&#10;whispering, &#34;Here it is beautiful in spring, in summer, in autumn,&#10;and in winter,&#34; and hundreds of pictures passed through his&#10;mind.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Thus many years rolled by. He had now become an old man,&#10;and was sitting, with his old wife, under an elder-tree in full&#10;bloom. They held each other by the hand exactly as the&#10;great-grandfather and the great-grandmother had done outside, and,&#10;like them, they talked about bygone days and of their golden&#10;wedding. The little girl with the blue eyes and elder-blossoms in&#10;her hair was sitting high up in the tree, and nodded to them,&#10;saying, &#34;To-day is the golden wedding!&#34; And then she took two&#10;flowers out of her wreath and kissed them. They glittered at first&#10;like silver, then like gold, and when she placed them on the heads&#10;of the old people each flower became a golden crown. There they&#10;both sat like a king and queen under the sweet-smelling tree, which&#10;looked exactly like an elder-tree, and he told his wife the story&#10;of the elder-tree mother as it had been told him when he was a&#10;little boy. They were both of opinion that the story contained many&#10;points like their own, and these similarities they liked&#10;best.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, so it is,&#34; said the little girl in the tree. &#34;Some&#10;call me Little Elder-tree Mother; others a Dryad; but my real name&#10;is &#39;Remembrance.&#39; It is I who sit in the tree which grows and&#10;grows. I can remember things and tell stories! But let&#39;s see if you&#10;have still got your flower.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the old man opened his prayer-book; the elder-blossom&#10;was still in it, and as fresh as if it had only just been put in.&#10;Remembrance nodded, and the two old people, with the golden crowns&#10;on their heads, sat in the glowing evening sun. They closed their&#10;eyes and&#8212;and&#8212;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Well, now the story is ended! The little boy in bed did&#10;not know whether he had dreamt it or heard it told; the teapot&#10;stood on the table, but no elder-tree was growing out of it, and&#10;the old man who had told the story was on the point of leaving the&#10;room, and he did go out.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;How beautiful it was!&#34; said the little boy. &#34;Mother, I&#10;have been to warm countries!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I believe you,&#34; said the mother; &#34;if one takes two cups&#10;of hot elder-tea it is quite natural that one gets into warm&#10;countries!&#34; And she covered him up well, so that he might not take&#10;cold. &#34;You have slept soundly while I was arguing with the old man&#10;whether it was a story or a fairy tale!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And what has become of the little elder-tree mother?&#34;&#10;asked the boy.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;She is in the teapot,&#34; said the mother; &#34;and there she&#10;may remain.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;Little Ida&#39;s Flowers'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;My poor flowers are quite dead,&#34; said little Ida, &#34;they&#10;were so pretty yesterday evening, and now all the leaves are&#10;hanging down quite withered. What do they do that for,&#34; she asked,&#10;of the student who sat on the sofa; she liked him very much, he&#10;could tell the most amusing stories, and cut out the prettiest&#10;pictures; hearts, and ladies dancing, castles with doors that&#10;opened, as well as flowers; he was a delightful student. &#34;Why do&#10;the flowers look so faded to-day?&#34; she asked again, and pointed to&#10;her nosegay, which was quite withered.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Don&#39;t you know what is the matter with them?&#34; said the&#10;student. &#34;The flowers were at a ball last night, and therefore, it&#10;is no wonder they hang their heads.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But flowers cannot dance?&#34; cried little Ida.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes indeed, they can,&#34; replied the student. &#34;When it&#10;grows dark, and everybody is asleep, they jump about quite merrily.&#10;They have a ball almost every night.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Can children go to these balls?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes,&#34; said the student, &#34;little daisies and lilies of the&#10;valley.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Where do the beautiful flowers dance?&#34; asked little&#10;Ida.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Have you not often seen the large castle outside the&#10;gates of the town, where the king lives in summer, and where the&#10;beautiful garden is full of flowers? And have you not fed the swans&#10;with bread when they swam towards you? Well, the flowers have&#10;capital balls there, believe me.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I was in the garden out there yesterday with my mother,&#34;&#10;said Ida, &#34;but all the leaves were off the trees, and there was not&#10;a single flower left. Where are they? I used to see so many in the&#10;summer.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;They are in the castle,&#34; replied the student. &#34;You must&#10;know that as soon as the king and all the court are gone into the&#10;town, the flowers run out of the garden into the castle, and you&#10;should see how merry they are. The two most beautiful roses seat&#10;themselves on the throne, and are called the king and queen, then&#10;all the red cockscombs range themselves on each side, and bow,&#10;these are the lords-in-waiting. After that the pretty flowers come&#10;in, and there is a grand ball. The blue violets represent little&#10;naval cadets, and dance with hyacinths and crocuses which they call&#10;young ladies. The tulips and tiger-lilies are the old ladies who&#10;sit and watch the dancing, so that everything may be conducted with&#10;order and propriety.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But,&#34; said little Ida, &#34;is there no one there to hurt the&#10;flowers for dancing in the king&#39;s castle?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No one knows anything about it,&#34; said the student. &#34;The&#10;old steward of the castle, who has to watch there at night,&#10;sometimes comes in; but he carries a great bunch of keys, and as&#10;soon as the flowers hear the keys rattle, they run and hide&#10;themselves behind the long curtains, and stand quite still, just&#10;peeping their heads out. Then the old steward says, &#39;I smell&#10;flowers here,&#39; but he cannot see them.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh how capital,&#34; said little Ida, clapping her hands.&#10;&#34;Should I be able to see these flowers?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes,&#34; said the student, &#34;mind you think of it the next&#10;time you go out, no doubt you will see them, if you peep through&#10;the window. I did so to-day, and I saw a long yellow lily lying&#10;stretched out on the sofa. She was a court lady.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Can the flowers from the Botanical Gardens go to these&#10;balls?&#34; asked Ida. &#34;It is such a distance!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh yes,&#34; said the student &#39;whenever they like, for they&#10;can fly. Have you not seen those beautiful red, white. and yellow&#10;butterflies, that look like flowers? They were flowers once. They&#10;have flown off their stalks into the air, and flap their leaves as&#10;if they were little wings to make them fly. Then, if they behave&#10;well, they obtain permission to fly about during the day, instead&#10;of being obliged to sit still on their stems at home, and so in&#10;time their leaves become real wings. It may be, however, that the&#10;flowers in the Botanical Gardens have never been to the king&#39;s&#10;palace, and, therefore, they know nothing of the merry doings at&#10;night, which take place there. I will tell you what to do, and the&#10;botanical professor, who lives close by here, will be so surprised.&#10;You know him very well, do you not? Well, next time you go into his&#10;garden, you must tell one of the flowers that there is going to be&#10;a grand ball at the castle, then that flower will tell all the&#10;others, and they will fly away to the castle as soon as possible.&#10;And when the professor walks into his garden, there will not be a&#10;single flower left. How he will wonder what has become of&#10;them!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But how can one flower tell another? Flowers cannot&#10;speak?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No, certainly not,&#34; replied the student; &#34;but they can&#10;make signs. Have you not often seen that when the wind blows they&#10;nod at one another, and rustle all their green leaves?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Can the professor understand the signs?&#34; asked&#10;Ida.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, to be sure he can. He went one morning into his&#10;garden, and saw a stinging nettle making signs with its leaves to a&#10;beautiful red carnation. It was saying, &#39;You are so pretty, I like&#10;you very much.&#39; But the professor did not approve of such nonsense,&#10;so he clapped his hands on the nettle to stop it. Then the leaves,&#10;which are its fingers, stung him so sharply that he has never&#10;ventured to touch a nettle since.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh how funny!&#34; said Ida, and she laughed.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;How can anyone put such notions into a child&#39;s head?&#34;&#10;said a tiresome lawyer, who had come to pay a visit, and sat on the&#10;sofa. He did not like the student, and would grumble when he saw&#10;him cutting out droll or amusing pictures. Sometimes it would be a&#10;man hanging on a gibbet and holding a heart in his hand as if he&#10;had been stealing hearts. Sometimes it was an old witch riding&#10;through the air on a broom and carrying her husband on her nose.&#10;But the lawyer did not like such jokes, and he would say as he had&#10;just said, &#34;How can anyone put such nonsense into a child&#39;s head!&#10;what absurd fancies there are!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But to little Ida, all these stories which the student&#10;told her about the flowers, seemed very droll, and she thought over&#10;them a great deal. The flowers did hang their heads, because they&#10;had been dancing all night, and were very tired, and most likely&#10;they were ill. Then she took them into the room where a number of&#10;toys lay on a pretty little table, and the whole of the table&#10;drawer besides was full of beautiful things. Her doll Sophy lay in&#10;the doll&#39;s bed asleep, and little Ida said to her, &#34;You must really&#10;get up Sophy, and be content to lie in the drawer to-night; the&#10;poor flowers are ill, and they must lie in your bed, then perhaps&#10;they will get well again.&#34; So she took the doll out, who looked&#10;quite cross, and said not a single word, for she was angry at being&#10;turned out of her bed. Ida placed the flowers in the doll&#39;s bed,&#10;and drew the quilt over them. Then she told them to lie quite still&#10;and be good, while she made some tea for them, so that they might&#10;be quite well and able to get up the next morning. And she drew the&#10;curtains close round the little bed, so that the sun might not&#10;shine in their eyes. During the whole evening she could not help&#10;thinking of what the student had told her. And before she went to&#10;bed herself, she was obliged to peep behind the curtains into the&#10;garden where all her mother&#39;s beautiful flowers grew, hyacinths and&#10;tulips, and many others. Then she whispered to them quite softly,&#10;&#34;I know you are going to a ball to-night.&#34; But the flowers appeared&#10;as if they did not understand, and not a leaf moved; still Ida felt&#10;quite sure she knew all about it. She lay awake a long time after&#10;she was in bed, thinking how pretty it must be to see all the&#10;beautiful flowers dancing in the king&#39;s garden. &#34;I wonder if my&#10;flowers have really been there,&#34; she said to herself, and then she&#10;fell asleep. In the night she awoke; she had been dreaming of the&#10;flowers and of the student, as well as of the tiresome lawyer who&#10;found fault with him. It was quite still in Ida&#39;s bedroom; the&#10;night-lamp burnt on the table, and her father and mother were&#10;asleep. &#34;I wonder if my flowers are still lying in Sophy&#39;s bed,&#34;&#10;she thought to herself; &#34;how much I should like to know.&#34; She&#10;raised herself a little, and glanced at the door of the room where&#10;all her flowers and playthings lay; it was partly open, and as she&#10;listened, it seemed as if some one in the room was playing the&#10;piano, but softly and more prettily than she had ever before heard&#10;it. &#34;Now all the flowers are certainly dancing in there,&#34; she&#10;thought, &#34;oh how much I should like to see them,&#34; but she did not&#10;dare move for fear of disturbing her father and mother. &#34;If they&#10;would only come in here,&#34; she thought; but they did not come, and&#10;the music continued to play so beautifully, and was so pretty, that&#10;she could resist no longer. She crept out of her little bed, went&#10;softly to the door and looked into the room. Oh what a splendid&#10;sight there was to be sure! There was no night-lamp burning, but&#10;the room appeared quite light, for the moon shone through the&#10;window upon the floor, and made it almost like day. All the&#10;hyacinths and tulips stood in two long rows down the room, not a&#10;single flower remained in the window, and the flower-pots were all&#10;empty. The flowers were dancing gracefully on the floor, making&#10;turns and holding each other by their long green leaves as they&#10;swung round. At the piano sat a large yellow lily which little Ida&#10;was sure she had seen in the summer, for she remembered the student&#10;saying she was very much like Miss Lina, one of Ida&#39;s friends. They&#10;all laughed at him then, but now it seemed to little Ida as if the&#10;tall, yellow flower was really like the young lady. She had just&#10;the same manners while playing, bending her long yellow face from&#10;side to side, and nodding in time to the beautiful music. Then she&#10;saw a large purple crocus jump into the middle of the table where&#10;the playthings stood, go up to the doll&#39;s bedstead and draw back&#10;the curtains; there lay the sick flowers, but they got up directly,&#10;and nodded to the others as a sign that they wished to dance with&#10;them. The old rough doll, with the broken mouth, stood up and bowed&#10;to the pretty flowers. They did not look ill at all now, but jumped&#10;about and were very merry, yet none of them noticed little Ida.&#10;Presently it seemed as if something fell from the table. Ida looked&#10;that way, and saw a slight carnival rod jumping down among the&#10;flowers as if it belonged to them; it was, however, very smooth and&#10;neat, and a little wax doll with a broad brimmed hat on her head,&#10;like the one worn by the lawyer, sat upon it. The carnival rod&#10;hopped about among the flowers on its three red stilted feet, and&#10;stamped quite loud when it danced the Mazurka; the flowers could&#10;not perform this dance, they were too light to stamp in that&#10;manner. All at once the wax doll which rode on the carnival rod&#10;seemed to grow larger and taller, and it turned round and said to&#10;the paper flowers, &#34;How can you put such things in a child&#39;s head?&#10;they are all foolish fancies;&#34; and then the doll was exactly like&#10;the lawyer with the broad brimmed hat, and looked as yellow and as&#10;cross as he did; but the paper dolls struck him on his thin legs,&#10;and he shrunk up again and became quite a little wax doll. This was&#10;very amusing, and Ida could not help laughing. The carnival rod&#10;went on dancing, and the lawyer was obliged to dance also. It was&#10;no use, he might make himself great and tall, or remain a little&#10;wax doll with a large black hat; still he must dance. Then at last&#10;the other flowers interceded for him, especially those who had lain&#10;in the doll&#39;s bed, and the carnival rod gave up his dancing. At the&#10;same moment a loud knocking was heard in the drawer, where Ida&#39;s&#10;doll Sophy lay with many other toys. Then the rough doll ran to the&#10;end of the table, laid himself flat down upon it, and began to pull&#10;the drawer out a little way.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then Sophy raised himself, and looked round quite&#10;astonished, &#34;There must be a ball here to-night,&#34; said Sophy. &#34;Why&#10;did not somebody tell me?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Will you dance with me?&#34; said the rough doll.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You are the right sort to dance with, certainly,&#34; said&#10;she, turning her back upon him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then she seated herself on the edge of the drawer, and&#10;thought that perhaps one of the flowers would ask her to dance; but&#10;none of them came. Then she coughed, &#34;Hem, hem, a-hem;&#34; but for all&#10;that not one came. The shabby doll now danced quite alone, and not&#10;very badly, after all. As none of the flowers seemed to notice&#10;Sophy, she let herself down from the drawer to the floor, so as to&#10;make a very great noise. All the flowers came round her directly,&#10;and asked if she had hurt herself, especially those who had lain in&#10;her bed. But she was not hurt at all, and Ida&#39;s flowers thanked her&#10;for the use of the nice bed, and were very kind to her. They led&#10;her into the middle of the room, where the moon shone, and danced&#10;with her, while all the other flowers formed a circle round them.&#10;Then Sophy was very happy, and said they might keep her bed; she&#10;did not mind lying in the drawer at all. But the flowers thanked&#10;her very much, and said,&#8212;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;We cannot live long. To-morrow morning we shall be quite&#10;dead; and you must tell little Ida to bury us in the garden, near&#10;to the grave of the canary; then, in the summer we shall wake up&#10;and be more beautiful than ever.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No, you must not die,&#34; said Sophy, as she kissed the&#10;flowers.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the door of the room opened, and a number of&#10;beautiful flowers danced in. Ida could not imagine where they could&#10;come from, unless they were the flowers from the king&#39;s garden.&#10;First came two lovely roses, with little golden crowns on their&#10;heads; these were the king and queen. Beautiful stocks and&#10;carnations followed, bowing to every one present. They had also&#10;music with them. Large poppies and peonies had pea-shells for&#10;instruments, and blew into them till they were quite red in the&#10;face. The bunches of blue hyacinths and the little white snowdrops&#10;jingled their bell-like flowers, as if they were real bells. Then&#10;came many more flowers: blue violets, purple heart&#39;s-ease, daisies,&#10;and lilies of the valley, and they all danced together, and kissed&#10;each other. It was very beautiful to behold.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;At last the flowers wished each other good-night. Then&#10;little Ida crept back into her bed again, and dreamt of all she had&#10;seen. When she arose the next morning, she went quickly to the&#10;little table, to see if the flowers were still there. She drew&#10;aside the curtains of the little bed. There they all lay, but quite&#10;faded; much more so than the day before. Sophy was lying in the&#10;drawer where Ida had placed her; but she looked very&#10;sleepy.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Do you remember what the flowers told you to say to me?&#34;&#10;said little Ida. But Sophy looked quite stupid, and said not a&#10;single word.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You are not kind at all,&#34; said Ida; &#34;and yet they all&#10;danced with you.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then she took a little paper box, on which were painted&#10;beautiful birds, and laid the dead flowers in it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;This shall be your pretty coffin,&#34; she said; &#34;and by and&#10;by, when my cousins come to visit me, they shall help me to bury&#10;you out in the garden; so that next summer you may grow up again&#10;more beautiful than ever.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Her cousins were two good-tempered boys, whose names were&#10;James and Adolphus. Their father had given them each a bow and&#10;arrow, and they had brought them to show Ida. She told them about&#10;the poor flowers which were dead; and as soon as they obtained&#10;permission, they went with her to bury them. The two boys walked&#10;first, with their crossbows on their shoulders, and little Ida&#10;followed, carrying the pretty box containing the dead flowers. They&#10;dug a little grave in the garden. Ida kissed her flowers and then&#10;laid them, with the box, in the earth. James and Adolphus then&#10;fired their crossbows over the grave, as they had neither guns nor&#10;cannons. &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Little Match-Seller'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;IT was terribly cold and nearly dark on the last evening&#10;of the old year, and the snow was falling fast. In the cold and the&#10;darkness, a poor little girl, with bare head and naked feet, roamed&#10;through the streets. It is true she had on a pair of slippers when&#10;she left home, but they were not of much use. They were very large,&#10;so large, indeed, that they had belonged to her mother, and the&#10;poor little creature had lost them in running across the street to&#10;avoid two carriages that were rolling along at a terrible rate. One&#10;of the slippers she could not find, and a boy seized upon the other&#10;and ran away with it, saying that he could use it as a cradle, when&#10;he had children of his own. So the little girl went on with her&#10;little naked feet, which were quite red and blue with the cold. In&#10;an old apron she carried a number of matches, and had a bundle of&#10;them in her hands. No one had bought anything of her the whole day,&#10;nor had any one given here even a penny. Shivering with cold and&#10;hunger, she crept along; poor little child, she looked the picture&#10;of misery. The snowflakes fell on her long, fair hair, which hung&#10;in curls on her shoulders, but she regarded them not.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Lights were shining from every window, and there was a&#10;savory smell of roast goose, for it was New-year&#39;s eve&#8212;yes, she&#10;remembered that. In a corner, between two houses, one of which&#10;projected beyond the other, she sank down and huddled herself&#10;together. She had drawn her little feet under her, but she could&#10;not keep off the cold; and she dared not go home, for she had sold&#10;no matches, and could not take home even a penny of money. Her&#10;father would certainly beat her; besides, it was almost as cold at&#10;home as here, for they had only the roof to cover them, through&#10;which the wind howled, although the largest holes had been stopped&#10;up with straw and rags. Her little hands were almost frozen with&#10;the cold. Ah! perhaps a burning match might be some good, if she&#10;could draw it from the bundle and strike it against the wall, just&#10;to warm her fingers. She drew one out-&#34;scratch!&#34; how it sputtered&#10;as it burnt! It gave a warm, bright light, like a little candle, as&#10;she held her hand over it. It was really a wonderful light. It&#10;seemed to the little girl that she was sitting by a large iron&#10;stove, with polished brass feet and a brass ornament. How the fire&#10;burned! and seemed so beautifully warm that the child stretched out&#10;her feet as if to warm them, when, lo! the flame of the match went&#10;out, the stove vanished, and she had only the remains of the&#10;half-burnt match in her hand.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;She rubbed another match on the wall. It burst into a&#10;flame, and where its light fell upon the wall it became as&#10;transparent as a veil, and she could see into the room. The table&#10;was covered with a snowy white table-cloth, on which stood a&#10;splendid dinner service, and a steaming roast goose, stuffed with&#10;apples and dried plums. And what was still more wonderful, the&#10;goose jumped down from the dish and waddled across the floor, with&#10;a knife and fork in its breast, to the little girl. Then the match&#10;went out, and there remained nothing but the thick, damp, cold wall&#10;before her.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;She lighted another match, and then she found herself&#10;sitting under a beautiful Christmas-tree. It was larger and more&#10;beautifully decorated than the one which she had seen through the&#10;glass door at the rich merchant&#39;s. Thousands of tapers were burning&#10;upon the green branches, and colored pictures, like those she had&#10;seen in the show-windows, looked down upon it all. The little one&#10;stretched out her hand towards them, and the match went&#10;out.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Christmas lights rose higher and higher, till they&#10;looked to her like the stars in the sky. Then she saw a star fall,&#10;leaving behind it a bright streak of fire. &#34;Some one is dying,&#34;&#10;thought the little girl, for her old grandmother, the only one who&#10;had ever loved her, and who was now dead, had told her that when a&#10;star falls, a soul was going up to God.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;She again rubbed a match on the wall, and the light shone&#10;round her; in the brightness stood her old grandmother, clear and&#10;shining, yet mild and loving in her appearance. &#34;Grandmother,&#34;&#10;cried the little one, &#34;O take me with you; I know you will go away&#10;when the match burns out; you will vanish like the warm stove, the&#10;roast goose, and the large, glorious Christmas-tree.&#34; And she made&#10;haste to light the whole bundle of matches, for she wished to keep&#10;her grandmother there. And the matches glowed with a light that was&#10;brighter than the noon-day, and her grandmother had never appeared&#10;so large or so beautiful. She took the little girl in her arms, and&#10;they both flew upwards in brightness and joy far above the earth,&#10;where there was neither cold nor hunger nor pain, for they were&#10;with God.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the dawn of morning there lay the poor little one, with&#10;pale cheeks and smiling mouth, leaning against the wall; she had&#10;been frozen to death on the last evening of the year; and the&#10;New-year&#39;s sun rose and shone upon a little corpse! The child still&#10;sat, in the stiffness of death, holding the matches in her hand,&#10;one bundle of which was burnt. &#34;She tried to warm herself,&#34; said&#10;some. No one imagined what beautiful things she had seen, nor into&#10;what glory she had entered with her grandmother, on New-year&#39;s day.&#10;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Little Mermaid'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;FAR out in the ocean, where the water is as blue as the&#10;prettiest cornflower, and as clear as crystal, it is very, very&#10;deep; so deep, indeed, that no cable could fathom it: many church&#10;steeples, piled one upon another, would not reach from the ground&#10;beneath to the surface of the water above. There dwell the Sea King&#10;and his subjects. We must not imagine that there is nothing at the&#10;bottom of the sea but bare yellow sand. No, indeed; the most&#10;singular flowers and plants grow there; the leaves and stems of&#10;which are so pliant, that the slightest agitation of the water&#10;causes them to stir as if they had life. Fishes, both large and&#10;small, glide between the branches, as birds fly among the trees&#10;here upon land. In the deepest spot of all, stands the castle of&#10;the Sea King. Its walls are built of coral, and the long, gothic&#10;windows are of the clearest amber. The roof is formed of shells,&#10;that open and close as the water flows over them. Their appearance&#10;is very beautiful, for in each lies a glittering pearl, which would&#10;be fit for the diadem of a queen.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Sea King had been a widower for many years, and his&#10;aged mother kept house for him. She was a very wise woman, and&#10;exceedingly proud of her high birth; on that account she wore&#10;twelve oysters on her tail; while others, also of high rank, were&#10;only allowed to wear six. She was, however, deserving of very great&#10;praise, especially for her care of the little sea-princesses, her&#10;grand-daughters. They were six beautiful children; but the youngest&#10;was the prettiest of them all; her skin was as clear and delicate&#10;as a rose-leaf, and her eyes as blue as the deepest sea; but, like&#10;all the others, she had no feet, and her body ended in a fish&#39;s&#10;tail. All day long they played in the great halls of the castle, or&#10;among the living flowers that grew out of the walls. The large&#10;amber windows were open, and the fish swam in, just as the swallows&#10;fly into our houses when we open the windows, excepting that the&#10;fishes swam up to the princesses, ate out of their hands, and&#10;allowed themselves to be stroked. Outside the castle there was a&#10;beautiful garden, in which grew bright red and dark blue flowers,&#10;and blossoms like flames of fire; the fruit glittered like gold,&#10;and the leaves and stems waved to and fro continually. The earth&#10;itself was the finest sand, but blue as the flame of burning&#10;sulphur. Over everything lay a peculiar blue radiance, as if it&#10;were surrounded by the air from above, through which the blue sky&#10;shone, instead of the dark depths of the sea. In calm weather the&#10;sun could be seen, looking like a purple flower, with the light&#10;streaming from the calyx. Each of the young princesses had a little&#10;plot of ground in the garden, where she might dig and plant as she&#10;pleased. One arranged her flower-bed into the form of a whale;&#10;another thought it better to make hers like the figure of a little&#10;mermaid; but that of the youngest was round like the sun, and&#10;contained flowers as red as his rays at sunset. She was a strange&#10;child, quiet and thoughtful; and while her sisters would be&#10;delighted with the wonderful things which they obtained from the&#10;wrecks of vessels, she cared for nothing but her pretty red&#10;flowers, like the sun, excepting a beautiful marble statue. It was&#10;the representation of a handsome boy, carved out of pure white&#10;stone, which had fallen to the bottom of the sea from a wreck. She&#10;planted by the statue a rose-colored weeping willow. It grew&#10;splendidly, and very soon hung its fresh branches over the statue,&#10;almost down to the blue sands. The shadow had a violet tint, and&#10;waved to and fro like the branches; it seemed as if the crown of&#10;the tree and the root were at play, and trying to kiss each other.&#10;Nothing gave her so much pleasure as to hear about the world above&#10;the sea. She made her old grandmother tell her all she knew of the&#10;ships and of the towns, the people and the animals. To her it&#10;seemed most wonderful and beautiful to hear that the flowers of the&#10;land should have fragrance, and not those below the sea; that the&#10;trees of the forest should be green; and that the fishes among the&#10;trees could sing so sweetly, that it was quite a pleasure to hear&#10;them. Her grandmother called the little birds fishes, or she would&#10;not have understood her; for she had never seen birds.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;When you have reached your fifteenth year,&#34; said the&#10;grand-mother, &#34;you will have permission to rise up out of the sea,&#10;to sit on the rocks in the moonlight, while the great ships are&#10;sailing by; and then you will see both forests and&#10;towns.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the following year, one of the sisters would be&#10;fifteen: but as each was a year younger than the other, the&#10;youngest would have to wait five years before her turn came to rise&#10;up from the bottom of the ocean, and see the earth as we do.&#10;However, each promised to tell the others what she saw on her first&#10;visit, and what she thought the most beautiful; for their&#10;grandmother could not tell them enough; there were so many things&#10;on which they wanted information. None of them longed so much for&#10;her turn to come as the youngest, she who had the longest time to&#10;wait, and who was so quiet and thoughtful. Many nights she stood by&#10;the open window, looking up through the dark blue water, and&#10;watching the fish as they splashed about with their fins and tails.&#10;She could see the moon and stars shining faintly; but through the&#10;water they looked larger than they do to our eyes. When something&#10;like a black cloud passed between her and them, she knew that it&#10;was either a whale swimming over her head, or a ship full of human&#10;beings, who never imagined that a pretty little mermaid was&#10;standing beneath them, holding out her white hands towards the keel&#10;of their ship.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;As soon as the eldest was fifteen, she was allowed to rise&#10;to the surface of the ocean. When she came back, she had hundreds&#10;of things to talk about; but the most beautiful, she said, was to&#10;lie in the moonlight, on a sandbank, in the quiet sea, near the&#10;coast, and to gaze on a large town nearby, where the lights were&#10;twinkling like hundreds of stars; to listen to the sounds of the&#10;music, the noise of carriages, and the voices of human beings, and&#10;then to hear the merry bells peal out from the church steeples; and&#10;because she could not go near to all those wonderful things, she&#10;longed for them more than ever. Oh, did not the youngest sister&#10;listen eagerly to all these descriptions? and afterwards, when she&#10;stood at the open window looking up through the dark blue water,&#10;she thought of the great city, with all its bustle and noise, and&#10;even fancied she could hear the sound of the church bells, down in&#10;the depths of the sea.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In another year the second sister received permission to&#10;rise to the surface of the water, and to swim about where she&#10;pleased. She rose just as the sun was setting, and this, she said,&#10;was the most beautiful sight of all. The whole sky looked like&#10;gold, while violet and rose-colored clouds, which she could not&#10;describe, floated over her; and, still more rapidly than the&#10;clouds, flew a large flock of wild swans towards the setting sun,&#10;looking like a long white veil across the sea. She also swam&#10;towards the sun; but it sunk into the waves, and the rosy tints&#10;faded from the clouds and from the sea.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The third sister&#39;s turn followed; she was the boldest of&#10;them all, and she swam up a broad river that emptied itself into&#10;the sea. On the banks she saw green hills covered with beautiful&#10;vines; palaces and castles peeped out from amid the proud trees of&#10;the forest; she heard the birds singing, and the rays of the sun&#10;were so powerful that she was obliged often to dive down under the&#10;water to cool her burning face. In a narrow creek she found a whole&#10;troop of little human children, quite naked, and sporting about in&#10;the water; she wanted to play with them, but they fled in a great&#10;fright; and then a little black animal came to the water; it was a&#10;dog, but she did not know that, for she had never before seen one.&#10;This animal barked at her so terribly that she became frightened,&#10;and rushed back to the open sea. But she said she should never&#10;forget the beautiful forest, the green hills, and the pretty little&#10;children who could swim in the water, although they had not fish&#39;s&#10;tails.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The fourth sister was more timid; she remained in the&#10;midst of the sea, but she said it was quite as beautiful there as&#10;nearer the land. She could see for so many miles around her, and&#10;the sky above looked like a bell of glass. She had seen the ships,&#10;but at such a great distance that they looked like sea-gulls. The&#10;dolphins sported in the waves, and the great whales spouted water&#10;from their nostrils till it seemed as if a hundred fountains were&#10;playing in every direction.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The fifth sister&#39;s birthday occurred in the winter; so&#10;when her turn came, she saw what the others had not seen the first&#10;time they went up. The sea looked quite green, and large icebergs&#10;were floating about, each like a pearl, she said, but larger and&#10;loftier than the churches built by men. They were of the most&#10;singular shapes, and glittered like diamonds. She had seated&#10;herself upon one of the largest, and let the wind play with her&#10;long hair, and she remarked that all the ships sailed by rapidly,&#10;and steered as far away as they could from the iceberg, as if they&#10;were afraid of it. Towards evening, as the sun went down, dark&#10;clouds covered the sky, the thunder rolled and the lightning&#10;flashed, and the red light glowed on the icebergs as they rocked&#10;and tossed on the heaving sea. On all the ships the sails were&#10;reefed with fear and trembling, while she sat calmly on the&#10;floating iceberg, watching the blue lightning, as it darted its&#10;forked flashes into the sea.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;When first the sisters had permission to rise to the&#10;surface, they were each delighted with the new and beautiful sights&#10;they saw; but now, as grown-up girls, they could go when they&#10;pleased, and they had become indifferent about it. They wished&#10;themselves back again in the water, and after a month had passed&#10;they said it was much more beautiful down below, and pleasanter to&#10;be at home. Yet often, in the evening hours, the five sisters would&#10;twine their arms round each other, and rise to the surface, in a&#10;row. They had more beautiful voices than any human being could&#10;have; and before the approach of a storm, and when they expected a&#10;ship would be lost, they swam before the vessel, and sang sweetly&#10;of the delights to be found in the depths of the sea, and begging&#10;the sailors not to fear if they sank to the bottom. But the sailors&#10;could not understand the song, they took it for the howling of the&#10;storm. And these things were never to be beautiful for them; for if&#10;the ship sank, the men were drowned, and their dead bodies alone&#10;reached the palace of the Sea King.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;When the sisters rose, arm-in-arm, through the water in&#10;this way, their youngest sister would stand quite alone, looking&#10;after them, ready to cry, only that the mermaids have no tears, and&#10;therefore they suffer more. &#34;Oh, were I but fifteen years old,&#34;&#10;said she: &#34;I know that I shall love the world up there, and all the&#10;people who live in it.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;At last she reached her fifteenth year. &#34;Well, now, you&#10;are grown up,&#34; said the old dowager, her grandmother; &#34;so you must&#10;let me adorn you like your other sisters;&#34; and she placed a wreath&#10;of white lilies in her hair, and every flower leaf was half a&#10;pearl. Then the old lady ordered eight great oysters to attach&#10;themselves to the tail of the princess to show her high&#10;rank.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But they hurt me so,&#34; said the little mermaid.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Pride must suffer pain,&#34; replied the old lady. Oh, how&#10;gladly she would have shaken off all this grandeur, and laid aside&#10;the heavy wreath! The red flowers in her own garden would have&#10;suited her much better, but she could not help herself: so she&#10;said, &#34;Farewell,&#34; and rose as lightly as a bubble to the surface of&#10;the water. The sun had just set as she raised her head above the&#10;waves; but the clouds were tinted with crimson and gold, and&#10;through the glimmering twilight beamed the evening star in all its&#10;beauty. The sea was calm, and the air mild and fresh. A large ship,&#10;with three masts, lay becalmed on the water, with only one sail&#10;set; for not a breeze stiffed, and the sailors sat idle on deck or&#10;amongst the rigging. There was music and song on board; and, as&#10;darkness came on, a hundred colored lanterns were lighted, as if&#10;the flags of all nations waved in the air. The little mermaid swam&#10;close to the cabin windows; and now and then, as the waves lifted&#10;her up, she could look in through clear glass window-panes, and see&#10;a number of well-dressed people within. Among them was a young&#10;prince, the most beautiful of all, with large black eyes; he was&#10;sixteen years of age, and his birthday was being kept with much&#10;rejoicing. The sailors were dancing on deck, but when the prince&#10;came out of the cabin, more than a hundred rockets rose in the air,&#10;making it as bright as day. The little mermaid was so startled that&#10;she dived under water; and when she again stretched out her head,&#10;it appeared as if all the stars of heaven were falling around her,&#10;she had never seen such fireworks before. Great suns spurted fire&#10;about, splendid fireflies flew into the blue air, and everything&#10;was reflected in the clear, calm sea beneath. The ship itself was&#10;so brightly illuminated that all the people, and even the smallest&#10;rope, could be distinctly and plainly seen. And how handsome the&#10;young prince looked, as he pressed the hands of all present and&#10;smiled at them, while the music resounded through the clear night&#10;air.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was very late; yet the little mermaid could not take&#10;her eyes from the ship, or from the beautiful prince. The colored&#10;lanterns had been extinguished, no more rockets rose in the air,&#10;and the cannon had ceased firing; but the sea became restless, and&#10;a moaning, grumbling sound could be heard beneath the waves: still&#10;the little mermaid remained by the cabin window, rocking up and&#10;down on the water, which enabled her to look in. After a while, the&#10;sails were quickly unfurled, and the noble ship continued her&#10;passage; but soon the waves rose higher, heavy clouds darkened the&#10;sky, and lightning appeared in the distance. A dreadful storm was&#10;approaching; once more the sails were reefed, and the great ship&#10;pursued her flying course over the raging sea. The waves rose&#10;mountains high, as if they would have overtopped the mast; but the&#10;ship dived like a swan between them, and then rose again on their&#10;lofty, foaming crests. To the little mermaid this appeared pleasant&#10;sport; not so to the sailors. At length the ship groaned and&#10;creaked; the thick planks gave way under the lashing of the sea as&#10;it broke over the deck; the mainmast snapped asunder like a reed;&#10;the ship lay over on her side; and the water rushed in. The little&#10;mermaid now perceived that the crew were in danger; even she&#10;herself was obliged to be careful to avoid the beams and planks of&#10;the wreck which lay scattered on the water. At one moment it was so&#10;pitch dark that she could not see a single object, but a flash of&#10;lightning revealed the whole scene; she could see every one who had&#10;been on board excepting the prince; when the ship parted, she had&#10;seen him sink into the deep waves, and she was glad, for she&#10;thought he would now be with her; and then she remembered that&#10;human beings could not live in the water, so that when he got down&#10;to her father&#39;s palace he would be quite dead. But he must not die.&#10;So she swam about among the beams and planks which strewed the&#10;surface of the sea, forgetting that they could crush her to pieces.&#10;Then she dived deeply under the dark waters, rising and falling&#10;with the waves, till at length she managed to reach the young&#10;prince, who was fast losing the power of swimming in that stormy&#10;sea. His limbs were failing him, his beautiful eyes were closed,&#10;and he would have died had not the little mermaid come to his&#10;assistance. She held his head above the water, and let the waves&#10;drift them where they would.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the morning the storm had ceased; but of the ship not a&#10;single fragment could be seen. The sun rose up red and glowing from&#10;the water, and its beams brought back the hue of health to the&#10;prince&#39;s cheeks; but his eyes remained closed. The mermaid kissed&#10;his high, smooth forehead, and stroked back his wet hair; he seemed&#10;to her like the marble statue in her little garden, and she kissed&#10;him again, and wished that he might live. Presently they came in&#10;sight of land; she saw lofty blue mountains, on which the white&#10;snow rested as if a flock of swans were lying upon them. Near the&#10;coast were beautiful green forests, and close by stood a large&#10;building, whether a church or a convent she could not tell. Orange&#10;and citron trees grew in the garden, and before the door stood&#10;lofty palms. The sea here formed a little bay, in which the water&#10;was quite still, but very deep; so she swam with the handsome&#10;prince to the beach, which was covered with fine, white sand, and&#10;there she laid him in the warm sunshine, taking care to raise his&#10;head higher than his body. Then bells sounded in the large white&#10;building, and a number of young girls came into the garden. The&#10;little mermaid swam out farther from the shore and placed herself&#10;between some high rocks that rose out of the water; then she&#10;covered her head and neck with the foam of the sea so that her&#10;little face might not be seen, and watched to see what would become&#10;of the poor prince. She did not wait long before she saw a young&#10;girl approach the spot where he lay. She seemed frightened at&#10;first, but only for a moment; then she fetched a number of people,&#10;and the mermaid saw that the prince came to life again, and smiled&#10;upon those who stood round him. But to her he sent no smile; he&#10;knew not that she had saved him. This made her very unhappy, and&#10;when he was led away into the great building, she dived down&#10;sorrowfully into the water, and returned to her father&#39;s castle.&#10;She had always been silent and thoughtful, and now she was more so&#10;than ever. Her sisters asked her what she had seen during her first&#10;visit to the surface of the water; but she would tell them nothing.&#10;Many an evening and morning did she rise to the place where she had&#10;left the prince. She saw the fruits in the garden ripen till they&#10;were gathered, the snow on the tops of the mountains melt away; but&#10;she never saw the prince, and therefore she returned home, always&#10;more sorrowful than before. It was her only comfort to sit in her&#10;own little garden, and fling her arm round the beautiful marble&#10;statue which was like the prince; but she gave up tending her&#10;flowers, and they grew in wild confusion over the paths, twining&#10;their long leaves and stems round the branches of the trees, so&#10;that the whole place became dark and gloomy. At length she could&#10;bear it no longer, and told one of her sisters all about it. Then&#10;the others heard the secret, and very soon it became known to two&#10;mermaids whose intimate friend happened to know who the prince was.&#10;She had also seen the festival on board ship, and she told them&#10;where the prince came from, and where his palace stood.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Come, little sister,&#34; said the other princesses; then&#10;they entwined their arms and rose up in a long row to the surface&#10;of the water, close by the spot where they knew the prince&#39;s palace&#10;stood. It was built of bright yellow shining stone, with long&#10;flights of marble steps, one of which reached quite down to the&#10;sea. Splendid gilded cupolas rose over the roof, and between the&#10;pillars that surrounded the whole building stood life-like statues&#10;of marble. Through the clear crystal of the lofty windows could be&#10;seen noble rooms, with costly silk curtains and hangings of&#10;tapestry; while the walls were covered with beautiful paintings&#10;which were a pleasure to look at. In the centre of the largest&#10;saloon a fountain threw its sparkling jets high up into the glass&#10;cupola of the ceiling, through which the sun shone down upon the&#10;water and upon the beautiful plants growing round the basin of the&#10;fountain. Now that she knew where he lived, she spent many an&#10;evening and many a night on the water near the palace. She would&#10;swim much nearer the shore than any of the others ventured to do;&#10;indeed once she went quite up the narrow channel under the marble&#10;balcony, which threw a broad shadow on the water. Here she would&#10;sit and watch the young prince, who thought himself quite alone in&#10;the bright moonlight. She saw him many times of an evening sailing&#10;in a pleasant boat, with music playing and flags waving. She peeped&#10;out from among the green rushes, and if the wind caught her long&#10;silvery-white veil, those who saw it believed it to be a swan,&#10;spreading out its wings. On many a night, too, when the fishermen,&#10;with their torches, were out at sea, she heard them relate so many&#10;good things about the doings of the young prince, that she was glad&#10;she had saved his life when he had been tossed about half-dead on&#10;the waves. And she remembered that his head had rested on her&#10;bosom, and how heartily she had kissed him; but he knew nothing of&#10;all this, and could not even dream of her. She grew more and more&#10;fond of human beings, and wished more and more to be able to wander&#10;about with those whose world seemed to be so much larger than her&#10;own. They could fly over the sea in ships, and mount the high hills&#10;which were far above the clouds; and the lands they possessed,&#10;their woods and their fields, stretched far away beyond the reach&#10;of her sight. There was so much that she wished to know, and her&#10;sisters were unable to answer all her questions. Then she applied&#10;to her old grandmother, who knew all about the upper world, which&#10;she very rightly called the lands above the sea.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;If human beings are not drowned,&#34; asked the little&#10;mermaid, &#34;can they live forever? do they never die as we do here in&#10;the sea?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes,&#34; replied the old lady, &#34;they must also die, and&#10;their term of life is even shorter than ours. We sometimes live to&#10;three hundred years, but when we cease to exist here we only become&#10;the foam on the surface of the water, and we have not even a grave&#10;down here of those we love. We have not immortal souls, we shall&#10;never live again; but, like the green sea-weed, when once it has&#10;been cut off, we can never flourish more. Human beings, on the&#10;contrary, have a soul which lives forever, lives after the body has&#10;been turned to dust. It rises up through the clear, pure air beyond&#10;the glittering stars. As we rise out of the water, and behold all&#10;the land of the earth, so do they rise to unknown and glorious&#10;regions which we shall never see.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Why have not we an immortal soul?&#34; asked the little&#10;mermaid mournfully; &#34;I would give gladly all the hundreds of years&#10;that I have to live, to be a human being only for one day, and to&#10;have the hope of knowing the happiness of that glorious world above&#10;the stars.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You must not think of that,&#34; said the old woman; &#34;we feel&#10;ourselves to be much happier and much better off than human&#10;beings.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;So I shall die,&#34; said the little mermaid, &#34;and as the&#10;foam of the sea I shall be driven about never again to hear the&#10;music of the waves, or to see the pretty flowers nor the red sun.&#10;Is there anything I can do to win an immortal soul?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No,&#34; said the old woman, &#34;unless a man were to love you&#10;so much that you were more to him than his father or mother; and if&#10;all his thoughts and all his love were fixed upon you, and the&#10;priest placed his right hand in yours, and he promised to be true&#10;to you here and hereafter, then his soul would glide into your body&#10;and you would obtain a share in the future happiness of mankind. He&#10;would give a soul to you and retain his own as well; but this can&#10;never happen. Your fish&#39;s tail, which amongst us is considered so&#10;beautiful, is thought on earth to be quite ugly; they do not know&#10;any better, and they think it necessary to have two stout props,&#10;which they call legs, in order to be handsome.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the little mermaid sighed, and looked sorrowfully at&#10;her fish&#39;s tail. &#34;Let us be happy,&#34; said the old lady, &#34;and dart&#10;and spring about during the three hundred years that we have to&#10;live, which is really quite long enough; after that we can rest&#10;ourselves all the better. This evening we are going to have a court&#10;ball.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It is one of those splendid sights which we can never see&#10;on earth. The walls and the ceiling of the large ball-room were of&#10;thick, but transparent crystal. May hundreds of colossal shells,&#10;some of a deep red, others of a grass green, stood on each side in&#10;rows, with blue fire in them, which lighted up the whole saloon,&#10;and shone through the walls, so that the sea was also illuminated.&#10;Innumerable fishes, great and small, swam past the crystal walls;&#10;on some of them the scales glowed with a purple brilliancy, and on&#10;others they shone like silver and gold. Through the halls flowed a&#10;broad stream, and in it danced the mermen and the mermaids to the&#10;music of their own sweet singing. No one on earth has such a lovely&#10;voice as theirs. The little mermaid sang more sweetly than them&#10;all. The whole court applauded her with hands and tails; and for a&#10;moment her heart felt quite gay, for she knew she had the loveliest&#10;voice of any on earth or in the sea. But she soon thought again of&#10;the world above her, for she could not forget the charming prince,&#10;nor her sorrow that she had not an immortal soul like his;&#10;therefore she crept away silently out of her father&#39;s palace, and&#10;while everything within was gladness and song, she sat in her own&#10;little garden sorrowful and alone. Then she heard the bugle&#10;sounding through the water, and thought&#8212;&#34;He is certainly sailing&#10;above, he on whom my wishes depend, and in whose hands I should&#10;like to place the happiness of my life. I will venture all for him,&#10;and to win an immortal soul, while my sisters are dancing in my&#10;father&#39;s palace, I will go to the sea witch, of whom I have always&#10;been so much afraid, but she can give me counsel and&#10;help.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And then the little mermaid went out from her garden, and&#10;took the road to the foaming whirlpools, behind which the sorceress&#10;lived. She had never been that way before: neither flowers nor&#10;grass grew there; nothing but bare, gray, sandy ground stretched&#10;out to the whirlpool, where the water, like foaming mill-wheels,&#10;whirled round everything that it seized, and cast it into the&#10;fathomless deep. Through the midst of these crushing whirlpools the&#10;little mermaid was obliged to pass, to reach the dominions of the&#10;sea witch; and also for a long distance the only road lay right&#10;across a quantity of warm, bubbling mire, called by the witch her&#10;turfmoor. Beyond this stood her house, in the centre of a strange&#10;forest, in which all the trees and flowers were polypi, half&#10;animals and half plants; they looked like serpents with a hundred&#10;heads growing out of the ground. The branches were long slimy arms,&#10;with fingers like flexible worms, moving limb after limb from the&#10;root to the top. All that could be reached in the sea they seized&#10;upon, and held fast, so that it never escaped from their clutches.&#10;The little mermaid was so alarmed at what she saw, that she stood&#10;still, and her heart beat with fear, and she was very nearly&#10;turning back; but she thought of the prince, and of the human soul&#10;for which she longed, and her courage returned. She fastened her&#10;long flowing hair round her head, so that the polypi might not&#10;seize hold of it. She laid her hands together across her bosom, and&#10;then she darted forward as a fish shoots through the water, between&#10;the supple arms and fingers of the ugly polypi, which were&#10;stretched out on each side of her. She saw that each held in its&#10;grasp something it had seized with its numerous little arms, as if&#10;they were iron bands. The white skeletons of human beings who had&#10;perished at sea, and had sunk down into the deep waters, skeletons&#10;of land animals, oars, rudders, and chests of ships were lying&#10;tightly grasped by their clinging arms; even a little mermaid, whom&#10;they had caught and strangled; and this seemed the most shocking of&#10;all to the little princess.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;She now came to a space of marshy ground in the wood,&#10;where large, fat water-snakes were rolling in the mire, and showing&#10;their ugly, drab-colored bodies. In the midst of this spot stood a&#10;house, built with the bones of shipwrecked human beings. There sat&#10;the sea witch, allowing a toad to eat from her mouth, just as&#10;people sometimes feed a canary with a piece of sugar. She called&#10;the ugly water-snakes her little chickens, and allowed them to&#10;crawl all over her bosom.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I know what you want,&#34; said the sea witch; &#34;it is very&#10;stupid of you, but you shall have your way, and it will bring you&#10;to sorrow, my pretty princess. You want to get rid of your fish&#39;s&#10;tail, and to have two supports instead of it, like human beings on&#10;earth, so that the young prince may fall in love with you, and that&#10;you may have an immortal soul.&#34; And then the witch laughed so loud&#10;and disgustingly, that the toad and the snakes fell to the ground,&#10;and lay there wriggling about. &#34;You are but just in time,&#34; said the&#10;witch; &#34;for after sunrise to-morrow I should not be able to help&#10;you till the end of another year. I will prepare a draught for you,&#10;with which you must swim to land tomorrow before sunrise, and sit&#10;down on the shore and drink it. Your tail will then disappear, and&#10;shrink up into what mankind calls legs, and you will feel great&#10;pain, as if a sword were passing through you. But all who see you&#10;will say that you are the prettiest little human being they ever&#10;saw. You will still have the same floating gracefulness of&#10;movement, and no dancer will ever tread so lightly; but at every&#10;step you take it will feel as if you were treading upon sharp&#10;knives, and that the blood must flow. If you will bear all this, I&#10;will help you.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, I will,&#34; said the little princess in a trembling&#10;voice, as she thought of the prince and the immortal&#10;soul.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But think again,&#34; said the witch; &#34;for when once your&#10;shape has become like a human being, you can no more be a mermaid.&#10;You will never return through the water to your sisters, or to your&#10;father&#39;s palace again; and if you do not win the love of the&#10;prince, so that he is willing to forget his father and mother for&#10;your sake, and to love you with his whole soul, and allow the&#10;priest to join your hands that you may be man and wife, then you&#10;will never have an immortal soul. The first morning after he&#10;marries another your heart will break, and you will become foam on&#10;the crest of the waves.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I will do it,&#34; said the little mermaid, and she became&#10;pale as death.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But I must be paid also,&#34; said the witch, &#34;and it is not&#10;a trifle that I ask. You have the sweetest voice of any who dwell&#10;here in the depths of the sea, and you believe that you will be&#10;able to charm the prince with it also, but this voice you must give&#10;to me; the best thing you possess will I have for the price of my&#10;draught. My own blood must be mixed with it, that it may be as&#10;sharp as a two-edged sword.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But if you take away my voice,&#34; said the little mermaid,&#10;&#34;what is left for me?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Your beautiful form, your graceful walk, and your&#10;expressive eyes; surely with these you can enchain a man&#39;s heart.&#10;Well, have you lost your courage? Put out your little tongue that I&#10;may cut it off as my payment; then you shall have the powerful&#10;draught.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It shall be,&#34; said the little mermaid.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the witch placed her cauldron on the fire, to prepare&#10;the magic draught.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Cleanliness is a good thing,&#34; said she, scouring the&#10;vessel with snakes, which she had tied together in a large knot;&#10;then she pricked herself in the breast, and let the black blood&#10;drop into it. The steam that rose formed itself into such horrible&#10;shapes that no one could look at them without fear. Every moment&#10;the witch threw something else into the vessel, and when it began&#10;to boil, the sound was like the weeping of a crocodile. When at&#10;last the magic draught was ready, it looked like the clearest&#10;water. &#34;There it is for you,&#34; said the witch. Then she cut off the&#10;mermaid&#39;s tongue, so that she became dumb, and would never again&#10;speak or sing. &#34;If the polypi should seize hold of you as you&#10;return through the wood,&#34; said the witch, &#34;throw over them a few&#10;drops of the potion, and their fingers will be torn into a thousand&#10;pieces.&#34; But the little mermaid had no occasion to do this, for the&#10;polypi sprang back in terror when they caught sight of the&#10;glittering draught, which shone in her hand like a twinkling&#10;star.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;So she passed quickly through the wood and the marsh, and&#10;between the rushing whirlpools. She saw that in her father&#39;s palace&#10;the torches in the ballroom were extinguished, and all within&#10;asleep; but she did not venture to go in to them, for now she was&#10;dumb and going to leave them forever, she felt as if her heart&#10;would break. She stole into the garden, took a flower from the&#10;flower-beds of each of her sisters, kissed her hand a thousand&#10;times towards the palace, and then rose up through the dark blue&#10;waters. The sun had not risen when she came in sight of the&#10;prince&#39;s palace, and approached the beautiful marble steps, but the&#10;moon shone clear and bright. Then the little mermaid drank the&#10;magic draught, and it seemed as if a two-edged sword went through&#10;her delicate body: she fell into a swoon, and lay like one dead.&#10;When the sun arose and shone over the sea, she recovered, and felt&#10;a sharp pain; but just before her stood the handsome young prince.&#10;He fixed his coal-black eyes upon her so earnestly that she cast&#10;down her own, and then became aware that her fish&#39;s tail was gone,&#10;and that she had as pretty a pair of white legs and tiny feet as&#10;any little maiden could have; but she had no clothes, so she&#10;wrapped herself in her long, thick hair. The prince asked her who&#10;she was, and where she came from, and she looked at him mildly and&#10;sorrowfully with her deep blue eyes; but she could not speak. Every&#10;step she took was as the witch had said it would be, she felt as if&#10;treading upon the points of needles or sharp knives; but she bore&#10;it willingly, and stepped as lightly by the prince&#39;s side as a&#10;soap-bubble, so that he and all who saw her wondered at her&#10;graceful-swaying movements. She was very soon arrayed in costly&#10;robes of silk and muslin, and was the most beautiful creature in&#10;the palace; but she was dumb, and could neither speak nor&#10;sing.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Beautiful female slaves, dressed in silk and gold, stepped&#10;forward and sang before the prince and his royal parents: one sang&#10;better than all the others, and the prince clapped his hands and&#10;smiled at her. This was great sorrow to the little mermaid; she&#10;knew how much more sweetly she herself could sing once, and she&#10;thought, &#34;Oh if he could only know that! I have given away my voice&#10;forever, to be with him.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The slaves next performed some pretty fairy-like dances,&#10;to the sound of beautiful music. Then the little mermaid raised her&#10;lovely white arms, stood on the tips of her toes, and glided over&#10;the floor, and danced as no one yet had been able to dance. At each&#10;moment her beauty became more revealed, and her expressive eyes&#10;appealed more directly to the heart than the songs of the slaves.&#10;Every one was enchanted, especially the prince, who called her his&#10;little foundling; and she danced again quite readily, to please&#10;him, though each time her foot touched the floor it seemed as if&#10;she trod on sharp knives.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The prince said she should remain with him always, and she&#10;received permission to sleep at his door, on a velvet cushion. He&#10;had a page&#39;s dress made for her, that she might accompany him on&#10;horseback. They rode together through the sweet-scented woods,&#10;where the green boughs touched their shoulders, and the little&#10;birds sang among the fresh leaves. She climbed with the prince to&#10;the tops of high mountains; and although her tender feet bled so&#10;that even her steps were marked, she only laughed, and followed him&#10;till they could see the clouds beneath them looking like a flock of&#10;birds travelling to distant lands. While at the prince&#39;s palace,&#10;and when all the household were asleep, she would go and sit on the&#10;broad marble steps; for it eased her burning feet to bathe them in&#10;the cold sea-water; and then she thought of all those below in the&#10;deep.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Once during the night her sisters came up arm-in-arm,&#10;singing sorrowfully, as they floated on the water. She beckoned to&#10;them, and then they recognized her, and told her how she had&#10;grieved them. After that, they came to the same place every night;&#10;and once she saw in the distance her old grandmother, who had not&#10;been to the surface of the sea for many years, and the old Sea&#10;King, her father, with his crown on his head. They stretched out&#10;their hands towards her, but they did not venture so near the land&#10;as her sisters did.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;As the days passed, she loved the prince more fondly, and&#10;he loved her as he would love a little child, but it never came&#10;into his head to make her his wife; yet, unless he married her, she&#10;could not receive an immortal soul; and, on the morning after his&#10;marriage with another, she would dissolve into the foam of the&#10;sea.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Do you not love me the best of them all?&#34; the eyes of the&#10;little mermaid seemed to say, when he took her in his arms, and&#10;kissed her fair forehead.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, you are dear to me,&#34; said the prince; &#34;for you have&#10;the best heart, and you are the most devoted to me; you are like a&#10;young maiden whom I once saw, but whom I shall never meet again. I&#10;was in a ship that was wrecked, and the waves cast me ashore near a&#10;holy temple, where several young maidens performed the service. The&#10;youngest of them found me on the shore, and saved my life. I saw&#10;her but twice, and she is the only one in the world whom I could&#10;love; but you are like her, and you have almost driven her image&#10;out of my mind. She belongs to the holy temple, and my good fortune&#10;has sent you to me instead of her; and we will never&#10;part.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ah, he knows not that it was I who saved his life,&#34;&#10;thought the little mermaid. &#34;I carried him over the sea to the wood&#10;where the temple stands: I sat beneath the foam, and watched till&#10;the human beings came to help him. I saw the pretty maiden that he&#10;loves better than he loves me;&#34; and the mermaid sighed deeply, but&#10;she could not shed tears. &#34;He says the maiden belongs to the holy&#10;temple, therefore she will never return to the world. They will&#10;meet no more: while I am by his side, and see him every day. I will&#10;take care of him, and love him, and give up my life for his&#10;sake.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Very soon it was said that the prince must marry, and that&#10;the beautiful daughter of a neighboring king would be his wife, for&#10;a fine ship was being fitted out. Although the prince gave out that&#10;he merely intended to pay a visit to the king, it was generally&#10;supposed that he really went to see his daughter. A great company&#10;were to go with him. The little mermaid smiled, and shook her head.&#10;She knew the prince&#39;s thoughts better than any of the&#10;others.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I must travel,&#34; he had said to her; &#34;I must see this&#10;beautiful princess; my parents desire it; but they will not oblige&#10;me to bring her home as my bride. I cannot love her; she is not&#10;like the beautiful maiden in the temple, whom you resemble. If I&#10;were forced to choose a bride, I would rather choose you, my dumb&#10;foundling, with those expressive eyes.&#34; And then he kissed her rosy&#10;mouth, played with her long waving hair, and laid his head on her&#10;heart, while she dreamed of human happiness and an immortal soul.&#10;&#34;You are not afraid of the sea, my dumb child,&#34; said he, as they&#10;stood on the deck of the noble ship which was to carry them to the&#10;country of the neighboring king. And then he told her of storm and&#10;of calm, of strange fishes in the deep beneath them, and of what&#10;the divers had seen there; and she smiled at his descriptions, for&#10;she knew better than any one what wonders were at the bottom of the&#10;sea.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the moonlight, when all on board were asleep, excepting&#10;the man at the helm, who was steering, she sat on the deck, gazing&#10;down through the clear water. She thought she could distinguish her&#10;father&#39;s castle, and upon it her aged grandmother, with the silver&#10;crown on her head, looking through the rushing tide at the keel of&#10;the vessel. Then her sisters came up on the waves, and gazed at her&#10;mournfully, wringing their white hands. She beckoned to them, and&#10;smiled, and wanted to tell them how happy and well off she was; but&#10;the cabin-boy approached, and when her sisters dived down he&#10;thought it was only the foam of the sea which he saw.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The next morning the ship sailed into the harbor of a&#10;beautiful town belonging to the king whom the prince was going to&#10;visit. The church bells were ringing, and from the high towers&#10;sounded a flourish of trumpets; and soldiers, with flying colors&#10;and glittering bayonets, lined the rocks through which they passed.&#10;Every day was a festival; balls and entertainments followed one&#10;another.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But the princess had not yet appeared. People said that&#10;she was being brought up and educated in a religious house, where&#10;she was learning every royal virtue. At last she came. Then the&#10;little mermaid, who was very anxious to see whether she was really&#10;beautiful, was obliged to acknowledge that she had never seen a&#10;more perfect vision of beauty. Her skin was delicately fair, and&#10;beneath her long dark eye-lashes her laughing blue eyes shone with&#10;truth and purity.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It was you,&#34; said the prince, &#34;who saved my life when I&#10;lay dead on the beach,&#34; and he folded his blushing bride in his&#10;arms. &#34;Oh, I am too happy,&#34; said he to the little mermaid; &#34;my&#10;fondest hopes are all fulfilled. You will rejoice at my happiness;&#10;for your devotion to me is great and sincere.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The little mermaid kissed his hand, and felt as if her&#10;heart were already broken. His wedding morning would bring death to&#10;her, and she would change into the foam of the sea. All the church&#10;bells rung, and the heralds rode about the town proclaiming the&#10;betrothal. Perfumed oil was burning in costly silver lamps on every&#10;altar. The priests waved the censers, while the bride and&#10;bridegroom joined their hands and received the blessing of the&#10;bishop. The little mermaid, dressed in silk and gold, held up the&#10;bride&#39;s train; but her ears heard nothing of the festive music, and&#10;her eyes saw not the holy ceremony; she thought of the night of&#10;death which was coming to her, and of all she had lost in the&#10;world. On the same evening the bride and bridegroom went on board&#10;ship; cannons were roaring, flags waving, and in the centre of the&#10;ship a costly tent of purple and gold had been erected. It&#10;contained elegant couches, for the reception of the bridal pair&#10;during the night. The ship, with swelling sails and a favorable&#10;wind, glided away smoothly and lightly over the calm sea. When it&#10;grew dark a number of colored lamps were lit, and the sailors&#10;danced merrily on the deck. The little mermaid could not help&#10;thinking of her first rising out of the sea, when she had seen&#10;similar festivities and joys; and she joined in the dance, poised&#10;herself in the air as a swallow when he pursues his prey, and all&#10;present cheered her with wonder. She had never danced so elegantly&#10;before. Her tender feet felt as if cut with sharp knives, but she&#10;cared not for it; a sharper pang had pierced through her heart. She&#10;knew this was the last evening she should ever see the prince, for&#10;whom she had forsaken her kindred and her home; she had given up&#10;her beautiful voice, and suffered unheard-of pain daily for him,&#10;while he knew nothing of it. This was the last evening that she&#10;would breathe the same air with him, or gaze on the starry sky and&#10;the deep sea; an eternal night, without a thought or a dream,&#10;awaited her: she had no soul and now she could never win one. All&#10;was joy and gayety on board ship till long after midnight; she&#10;laughed and danced with the rest, while the thoughts of death were&#10;in her heart. The prince kissed his beautiful bride, while she&#10;played with his raven hair, till they went arm-in-arm to rest in&#10;the splendid tent. Then all became still on board the ship; the&#10;helmsman, alone awake, stood at the helm. The little mermaid leaned&#10;her white arms on the edge of the vessel, and looked towards the&#10;east for the first blush of morning, for that first ray of dawn&#10;that would bring her death. She saw her sisters rising out of the&#10;flood: they were as pale as herself; but their long beautiful hair&#10;waved no more in the wind, and had been cut off.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;We have given our hair to the witch,&#34; said they, &#34;to&#10;obtain help for you, that you may not die to-night. She has given&#10;us a knife: here it is, see it is very sharp. Before the sun rises&#10;you must plunge it into the heart of the prince; when the warm&#10;blood falls upon your feet they will grow together again, and form&#10;into a fish&#39;s tail, and you will be once more a mermaid, and return&#10;to us to live out your three hundred years before you die and&#10;change into the salt sea foam. Haste, then; he or you must die&#10;before sunrise. Our old grandmother moans so for you, that her&#10;white hair is falling off from sorrow, as ours fell under the&#10;witch&#39;s scissors. Kill the prince and come back; hasten: do you not&#10;see the first red streaks in the sky? In a few minutes the sun will&#10;rise, and you must die.&#34; And then they sighed deeply and&#10;mournfully, and sank down beneath the waves.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The little mermaid drew back the crimson curtain of the&#10;tent, and beheld the fair bride with her head resting on the&#10;prince&#39;s breast. She bent down and kissed his fair brow, then&#10;looked at the sky on which the rosy dawn grew brighter and&#10;brighter; then she glanced at the sharp knife, and again fixed her&#10;eyes on the prince, who whispered the name of his bride in his&#10;dreams. She was in his thoughts, and the knife trembled in the hand&#10;of the little mermaid: then she flung it far away from her into the&#10;waves; the water turned red where it fell, and the drops that&#10;spurted up looked like blood. She cast one more lingering,&#10;half-fainting glance at the prince, and then threw herself from the&#10;ship into the sea, and thought her body was dissolving into foam.&#10;The sun rose above the waves, and his warm rays fell on the cold&#10;foam of the little mermaid, who did not feel as if she were dying.&#10;She saw the bright sun, and all around her floated hundreds of&#10;transparent beautiful beings; she could see through them the white&#10;sails of the ship, and the red clouds in the sky; their speech was&#10;melodious, but too ethereal to be heard by mortal ears, as they&#10;were also unseen by mortal eyes. The little mermaid perceived that&#10;she had a body like theirs, and that she continued to rise higher&#10;and higher out of the foam. &#34;Where am I?&#34; asked she, and her voice&#10;sounded ethereal, as the voice of those who were with her; no&#10;earthly music could imitate it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Among the daughters of the air,&#34; answered one of them. &#34;A&#10;mermaid has not an immortal soul, nor can she obtain one unless she&#10;wins the love of a human being. On the power of another hangs her&#10;eternal destiny. But the daughters of the air, although they do not&#10;possess an immortal soul, can, by their good deeds, procure one for&#10;themselves. We fly to warm countries, and cool the sultry air that&#10;destroys mankind with the pestilence. We carry the perfume of the&#10;flowers to spread health and restoration. After we have striven for&#10;three hundred years to all the good in our power, we receive an&#10;immortal soul and take part in the happiness of mankind. You, poor&#10;little mermaid, have tried with your whole heart to do as we are&#10;doing; you have suffered and endured and raised yourself to the&#10;spirit-world by your good deeds; and now, by striving for three&#10;hundred years in the same way, you may obtain an immortal&#10;soul.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The little mermaid lifted her glorified eyes towards the&#10;sun, and felt them, for the first time, filling with tears. On the&#10;ship, in which she had left the prince, there were life and noise;&#10;she saw him and his beautiful bride searching for her; sorrowfully&#10;they gazed at the pearly foam, as if they knew she had thrown&#10;herself into the waves. Unseen she kissed the forehead of her&#10;bride, and fanned the prince, and then mounted with the other&#10;children of the air to a rosy cloud that floated through the&#10;aether.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;After three hundred years, thus shall we float into the&#10;kingdom of heaven,&#34; said she. &#34;And we may even get there sooner,&#34;&#10;whispered one of her companions. &#34;Unseen we can enter the houses of&#10;men, where there are children, and for every day on which we find a&#10;good child, who is the joy of his parents and deserves their love,&#10;our time of probation is shortened. The child does not know, when&#10;we fly through the room, that we smile with joy at his good&#10;conduct, for we can count one year less of our three hundred years.&#10;But when we see a naughty or a wicked child, we shed tears of&#10;sorrow, and for every tear a day is added to our time of trial!&#34;&#10;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;Little Tiny or Thumbelina'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;THERE was once a woman who wished very much to have a&#10;little child, but she could not obtain her wish. At last she went&#10;to a fairy, and said, &#34;I should so very much like to have a little&#10;child; can you tell me where I can find one?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, that can be easily managed,&#34; said the fairy. &#34;Here is&#10;a barleycorn of a different kind to those which grow in the&#10;farmer&#39;s fields, and which the chickens eat; put it into a&#10;flower-pot, and see what will happen.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Thank you,&#34; said the woman, and she gave the fairy twelve&#10;shillings, which was the price of the barleycorn. Then she went&#10;home and planted it, and immediately there grew up a large handsome&#10;flower, something like a tulip in appearance, but with its leaves&#10;tightly closed as if it were still a bud. &#34;It is a beautiful&#10;flower,&#34; said the woman, and she kissed the red and golden-colored&#10;leaves, and while she did so the flower opened, and she could see&#10;that it was a real tulip. Within the flower, upon the green velvet&#10;stamens, sat a very delicate and graceful little maiden. She was&#10;scarcely half as long as a thumb, and they gave her the name of&#10;&#34;Thumbelina,&#34; or Tiny, because she was so small. A walnut-shell,&#10;elegantly polished, served her for a cradle; her bed was formed of&#10;blue violet-leaves, with a rose-leaf for a counterpane. Here she&#10;slept at night, but during the day she amused herself on a table,&#10;where the woman had placed a plateful of water. Round this plate&#10;were wreaths of flowers with their stems in the water, and upon it&#10;floated a large tulip-leaf, which served Tiny for a boat. Here the&#10;little maiden sat and rowed herself from side to side, with two&#10;oars made of white horse-hair. It really was a very pretty sight.&#10;Tiny could, also, sing so softly and sweetly that nothing like her&#10;singing had ever before been heard. One night, while she lay in her&#10;pretty bed, a large, ugly, wet toad crept through a broken pane of&#10;glass in the window, and leaped right upon the table where Tiny lay&#10;sleeping under her rose-leaf quilt. &#34;What a pretty little wife this&#10;would make for my son, said the toad, and she took up the&#10;walnut-shell in which little Tiny lay asleep, and jumped through&#10;the window with it into the garden.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the swampy margin of a broad stream in the garden lived&#10;the toad, with her son. He was uglier even than his mother, and&#10;when he saw the pretty little maiden in her elegant bed, he could&#10;only cry, &#34;Croak, croak, croak.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Don&#39;t speak so loud, or she will wake,&#34; said the toad,&#10;&#34;and then she might run away, for she is as light as swan&#39;s down.&#10;We will place her on one of the water-lily leaves out in the&#10;stream; it will be like an island to her, she is so light and&#10;small, and then she cannot escape; and, while she is away, we will&#10;make haste and prepare the state-room under the marsh, in which you&#10;are to live when you are married.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Far out in the stream grew a number of water-lilies, with&#10;broad green leaves, which seemed to float on the top of the water.&#10;The largest of these leaves appeared farther off than the rest, and&#10;the old toad swam out to it with the walnut-shell, in which little&#10;Tiny lay still asleep. The tiny little creature woke very early in&#10;the morning, and began to cry bitterly when she found where she&#10;was, for she could see nothing but water on every side of the large&#10;green leaf, and no way of reaching the land. Meanwhile the old toad&#10;was very busy under the marsh, decking her room with rushes and&#10;wild yellow flowers, to make it look pretty for her new&#10;daughter-in-law. Then she swam out with her ugly son to the leaf on&#10;which she had placed poor little Tiny. She wanted to fetch the&#10;pretty bed, that she might put it in the bridal chamber to be ready&#10;for her. The old toad bowed low to her in the water, and said,&#10;&#34;Here is my son, he will be your husband, and you will live happily&#10;in the marsh by the stream.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Croak, croak, croak,&#34; was all her son could say for&#10;himself; so the toad took up the elegant little bed, and swam away&#10;with it, leaving Tiny all alone on the green leaf, where she sat&#10;and wept. She could not bear to think of living with the old toad,&#10;and having her ugly son for a husband. The little fishes, who swam&#10;about in the water beneath, had seen the toad, and heard what she&#10;said, so they lifted their heads above the water to look at the&#10;little maiden. As soon as they caught sight of her, they saw she&#10;was very pretty, and it made them very sorry to think that she must&#10;go and live with the ugly toads. &#34;No, it must never be!&#34; so they&#10;assembled together in the water, round the green stalk which held&#10;the leaf on which the little maiden stood, and gnawed it away at&#10;the root with their teeth. Then the leaf floated down the stream,&#10;carrying Tiny far away out of reach of land.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Tiny sailed past many towns, and the little birds in the&#10;bushes saw her, and sang, &#34;What a lovely little creature;&#34; so the&#10;leaf swam away with her farther and farther, till it brought her to&#10;other lands. A graceful little white butterfly constantly fluttered&#10;round her, and at last alighted on the leaf. Tiny pleased him, and&#10;she was glad of it, for now the toad could not possibly reach her,&#10;and the country through which she sailed was beautiful, and the sun&#10;shone upon the water, till it glittered like liquid gold. She took&#10;off her girdle and tied one end of it round the butterfly, and the&#10;other end of the ribbon she fastened to the leaf, which now glided&#10;on much faster than ever, taking little Tiny with it as she stood.&#10;Presently a large cockchafer flew by; the moment he caught sight of&#10;her, he seized her round her delicate waist with his claws, and&#10;flew with her into a tree. The green leaf floated away on the&#10;brook, and the butterfly flew with it, for he was fastened to it,&#10;and could not get away.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Oh, how frightened little Tiny felt when the cockchafer&#10;flew with her to the tree! But especially was she sorry for the&#10;beautiful white butterfly which she had fastened to the leaf, for&#10;if he could not free himself he would die of hunger. But the&#10;cockchafer did not trouble himself at all about the matter. He&#10;seated himself by her side on a large green leaf, gave her some&#10;honey from the flowers to eat, and told her she was very pretty,&#10;though not in the least like a cockchafer. After a time, all the&#10;cockchafers turned up their feelers, and said, &#34;She has only two&#10;legs! how ugly that looks.&#34; &#34;She has no feelers,&#34; said another.&#10;&#34;Her waist is quite slim. Pooh! she is like a human&#10;being.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh! she is ugly,&#34; said all the lady cockchafers, although&#10;Tiny was very pretty. Then the cockchafer who had run away with&#10;her, believed all the others when they said she was ugly, and would&#10;have nothing more to say to her, and told her she might go where&#10;she liked. Then he flew down with her from the tree, and placed her&#10;on a daisy, and she wept at the thought that she was so ugly that&#10;even the cockchafers would have nothing to say to her. And all the&#10;while she was really the loveliest creature that one could imagine,&#10;and as tender and delicate as a beautiful rose-leaf. During the&#10;whole summer poor little Tiny lived quite alone in the wide forest.&#10;She wove herself a bed with blades of grass, and hung it up under a&#10;broad leaf, to protect herself from the rain. She sucked the honey&#10;from the flowers for food, and drank the dew from their leaves&#10;every morning. So passed away the summer and the autumn, and then&#10;came the winter,&#8212;the long, cold winter. All the birds who had sung&#10;to her so sweetly were flown away, and the trees and the flowers&#10;had withered. The large clover leaf under the shelter of which she&#10;had lived, was now rolled together and shrivelled up, nothing&#10;remained but a yellow withered stalk. She felt dreadfully cold, for&#10;her clothes were torn, and she was herself so frail and delicate,&#10;that poor little Tiny was nearly frozen to death. It began to snow&#10;too; and the snow-flakes, as they fell upon her, were like a whole&#10;shovelful falling upon one of us, for we are tall, but she was only&#10;an inch high. Then she wrapped herself up in a dry leaf, but it&#10;cracked in the middle and could not keep her warm, and she shivered&#10;with cold. Near the wood in which she had been living lay a&#10;corn-field, but the corn had been cut a long time; nothing remained&#10;but the bare dry stubble standing up out of the frozen ground. It&#10;was to her like struggling through a large wood. Oh! how she&#10;shivered with the cold. She came at last to the door of a&#10;field-mouse, who had a little den under the corn-stubble. There&#10;dwelt the field-mouse in warmth and comfort, with a whole roomful&#10;of corn, a kitchen, and a beautiful dining room. Poor little Tiny&#10;stood before the door just like a little beggar-girl, and begged&#10;for a small piece of barley-corn, for she had been without a morsel&#10;to eat for two days.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You poor little creature,&#34; said the field-mouse, who was&#10;really a good old field-mouse, &#34;come into my warm room and dine&#10;with me.&#34; She was very pleased with Tiny, so she said, &#34;You are&#10;quite welcome to stay with me all the winter, if you like; but you&#10;must keep my rooms clean and neat, and tell me stories, for I shall&#10;like to hear them very much.&#34; And Tiny did all the field-mouse&#10;asked her, and found herself very comfortable.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;We shall have a visitor soon,&#34; said the field-mouse one&#10;day; &#34;my neighbor pays me a visit once a week. He is better off&#10;than I am; he has large rooms, and wears a beautiful black velvet&#10;coat. If you could only have him for a husband, you would be well&#10;provided for indeed. But he is blind, so you must tell him some of&#10;your prettiest stories.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But Tiny did not feel at all interested about this&#10;neighbor, for he was a mole. However, he came and paid his visit&#10;dressed in his black velvet coat.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;He is very rich and learned, and his house is twenty&#10;times larger than mine,&#34; said the field-mouse.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;He was rich and learned, no doubt, but he always spoke&#10;slightingly of the sun and the pretty flowers, because he had never&#10;seen them. Tiny was obliged to sing to him, &#34;Lady-bird, lady-bird,&#10;fly away home,&#34; and many other pretty songs. And the mole fell in&#10;love with her because she had such a sweet voice; but he said&#10;nothing yet, for he was very cautious. A short time before, the&#10;mole had dug a long passage under the earth, which led from the&#10;dwelling of the field-mouse to his own, and here she had permission&#10;to walk with Tiny whenever she liked. But he warned them not to be&#10;alarmed at the sight of a dead bird which lay in the passage. It&#10;was a perfect bird, with a beak and feathers, and could not have&#10;been dead long, and was lying just where the mole had made his&#10;passage. The mole took a piece of phosphorescent wood in his mouth,&#10;and it glittered like fire in the dark; then he went before them to&#10;light them through the long, dark passage. When they came to the&#10;spot where lay the dead bird, the mole pushed his broad nose&#10;through the ceiling, the earth gave way, so that there was a large&#10;hole, and the daylight shone into the passage. In the middle of the&#10;floor lay a dead swallow, his beautiful wings pulled close to his&#10;sides, his feet and his head drawn up under his feathers; the poor&#10;bird had evidently died of the cold. It made little Tiny very sad&#10;to see it, she did so love the little birds; all the summer they&#10;had sung and twittered for her so beautifully. But the mole pushed&#10;it aside with his crooked legs, and said, &#34;He will sing no more&#10;now. How miserable it must be to be born a little bird! I am&#10;thankful that none of my children will ever be birds, for they can&#10;do nothing but cry, &#39;Tweet, tweet,&#39; and always die of hunger in the&#10;winter.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, you may well say that, as a clever man!&#34; exclaimed&#10;the field-mouse, &#34;What is the use of his twittering, for when&#10;winter comes he must either starve or be frozen to death. Still&#10;birds are very high bred.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Tiny said nothing; but when the two others had turned&#10;their backs on the bird, she stooped down and stroked aside the&#10;soft feathers which covered the head, and kissed the closed&#10;eyelids. &#34;Perhaps this was the one who sang to me so sweetly in the&#10;summer,&#34; she said; &#34;and how much pleasure it gave me, you dear,&#10;pretty bird.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The mole now stopped up the hole through which the&#10;daylight shone, and then accompanied the lady home. But during the&#10;night Tiny could not sleep; so she got out of bed and wove a large,&#10;beautiful carpet of hay; then she carried it to the dead bird, and&#10;spread it over him; with some down from the flowers which she had&#10;found in the field-mouse&#39;s room. It was as soft as wool, and she&#10;spread some of it on each side of the bird, so that he might lie&#10;warmly in the cold earth. &#34;Farewell, you pretty little bird,&#34; said&#10;she, &#34;farewell; thank you for your delightful singing during the&#10;summer, when all the trees were green, and the warm sun shone upon&#10;us. Then she laid her head on the bird&#39;s breast, but she was&#10;alarmed immediately, for it seemed as if something inside the bird&#10;went &#34;thump, thump.&#34; It was the bird&#39;s heart; he was not really&#10;dead, only benumbed with the cold, and the warmth had restored him&#10;to life. In autumn, all the swallows fly away into warm countries,&#10;but if one happens to linger, the cold seizes it, it becomes&#10;frozen, and falls down as if dead; it remains where it fell, and&#10;the cold snow covers it. Tiny trembled very much; she was quite&#10;frightened, for the bird was large, a great deal larger than&#10;herself,&#8212;she was only an inch high. But she took courage, laid the&#10;wool more thickly over the poor swallow, and then took a leaf which&#10;she had used for her own counterpane, and laid it over the head of&#10;the poor bird. The next morning she again stole out to see him. He&#10;was alive but very weak; he could only open his eyes for a moment&#10;to look at Tiny, who stood by holding a piece of decayed wood in&#10;her hand, for she had no other lantern. &#34;Thank you, pretty little&#10;maiden,&#34; said the sick swallow; &#34;I have been so nicely warmed, that&#10;I shall soon regain my strength, and be able to fly about again in&#10;the warm sunshine.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh,&#34; said she, &#34;it is cold out of doors now; it snows and&#10;freezes. Stay in your warm bed; I will take care of&#10;you.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then she brought the swallow some water in a flower-leaf,&#10;and after he had drank, he told her that he had wounded one of his&#10;wings in a thorn-bush, and could not fly as fast as the others, who&#10;were soon far away on their journey to warm countries. Then at last&#10;he had fallen to the earth, and could remember no more, nor how he&#10;came to be where she had found him. The whole winter the swallow&#10;remained underground, and Tiny nursed him with care and love.&#10;Neither the mole nor the field-mouse knew anything about it, for&#10;they did not like swallows. Very soon the spring time came, and the&#10;sun warmed the earth. Then the swallow bade farewell to Tiny, and&#10;she opened the hole in the ceiling which the mole had made. The sun&#10;shone in upon them so beautifully, that the swallow asked her if&#10;she would go with him; she could sit on his back, he said, and he&#10;would fly away with her into the green woods. But Tiny knew it&#10;would make the field-mouse very grieved if she left her in that&#10;manner, so she said, &#34;No, I cannot.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Farewell, then, farewell, you good, pretty little&#10;maiden,&#34; said the swallow; and he flew out into the&#10;sunshine.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Tiny looked after him, and the tears rose in her eyes. She&#10;was very fond of the poor swallow.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Tweet, tweet,&#34; sang the bird, as he flew out into the&#10;green woods, and Tiny felt very sad. She was not allowed to go out&#10;into the warm sunshine. The corn which had been sown in the field&#10;over the house of the field-mouse had grown up high into the air,&#10;and formed a thick wood to Tiny, who was only an inch in&#10;height.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You are going to be married, Tiny,&#34; said the field-mouse.&#10;&#34;My neighbor has asked for you. What good fortune for a poor child&#10;like you. Now we will prepare your wedding clothes. They must be&#10;both woollen and linen. Nothing must be wanting when you are the&#10;mole&#39;s wife.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Tiny had to turn the spindle, and the field-mouse hired&#10;four spiders, who were to weave day and night. Every evening the&#10;mole visited her, and was continually speaking of the time when the&#10;summer would be over. Then he would keep his wedding-day with Tiny;&#10;but now the heat of the sun was so great that it burned the earth,&#10;and made it quite hard, like a stone. As soon, as the summer was&#10;over, the wedding should take place. But Tiny was not at all&#10;pleased; for she did not like the tiresome mole. Every morning when&#10;the sun rose, and every evening when it went down, she would creep&#10;out at the door, and as the wind blew aside the ears of corn, so&#10;that she could see the blue sky, she thought how beautiful and&#10;bright it seemed out there, and wished so much to see her dear&#10;swallow again. But he never returned; for by this time he had flown&#10;far away into the lovely green forest.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;When autumn arrived, Tiny had her outfit quite ready; and&#10;the field-mouse said to her, &#34;In four weeks the wedding must take&#10;place.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then Tiny wept, and said she would not marry the&#10;disagreeable mole.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Nonsense,&#34; replied the field-mouse. &#34;Now don&#39;t be&#10;obstinate, or I shall bite you with my white teeth. He is a very&#10;handsome mole; the queen herself does not wear more beautiful&#10;velvets and furs. His kitchen and cellars are quite full. You ought&#10;to be very thankful for such good fortune.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;So the wedding-day was fixed, on which the mole was to&#10;fetch Tiny away to live with him, deep under the earth, and never&#10;again to see the warm sun, because he did not like it. The poor&#10;child was very unhappy at the thought of saying farewell to the&#10;beautiful sun, and as the field-mouse had given her permission to&#10;stand at the door, she went to look at it once more.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Farewell bright sun,&#34; she cried, stretching out her arm&#10;towards it; and then she walked a short distance from the house;&#10;for the corn had been cut, and only the dry stubble remained in the&#10;fields. &#34;Farewell, farewell,&#34; she repeated, twining her arm round a&#10;little red flower that grew just by her side. &#34;Greet the little&#10;swallow from me, if you should see him again.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Tweet, tweet,&#34; sounded over her head suddenly. She looked&#10;up, and there was the swallow himself flying close by. As soon as&#10;he spied Tiny, he was delighted; and then she told him how&#10;unwilling she felt to marry the ugly mole, and to live always&#10;beneath the earth, and never to see the bright sun any more. And as&#10;she told him she wept.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Cold winter is coming,&#34; said the swallow, &#34;and I am going&#10;to fly away into warmer countries. Will you go with me? You can sit&#10;on my back, and fasten yourself on with your sash. Then we can fly&#10;away from the ugly mole and his gloomy rooms,&#8212;far away, over the&#10;mountains, into warmer countries, where the sun shines more&#10;brightly&#8212;than here; where it is always summer, and the flowers&#10;bloom in greater beauty. Fly now with me, dear little Tiny; you&#10;saved my life when I lay frozen in that dark passage.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, I will go with you,&#34; said Tiny; and she seated&#10;herself on the bird&#39;s back, with her feet on his outstretched&#10;wings, and tied her girdle to one of his strongest&#10;feathers.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the swallow rose in the air, and flew over forest and&#10;over sea, high above the highest mountains, covered with eternal&#10;snow. Tiny would have been frozen in the cold air, but she crept&#10;under the bird&#39;s warm feathers, keeping her little head uncovered,&#10;so that she might admire the beautiful lands over which they&#10;passed. At length they reached the warm countries, where the sun&#10;shines brightly, and the sky seems so much higher above the earth.&#10;Here, on the hedges, and by the wayside, grew purple, green, and&#10;white grapes; lemons and oranges hung from trees in the woods; and&#10;the air was fragrant with myrtles and orange blossoms. Beautiful&#10;children ran along the country lanes, playing with large gay&#10;butterflies; and as the swallow flew farther and farther, every&#10;place appeared still more lovely.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;At last they came to a blue lake, and by the side of it,&#10;shaded by trees of the deepest green, stood a palace of dazzling&#10;white marble, built in the olden times. Vines clustered round its&#10;lofty pillars, and at the top were many swallows&#39; nests, and one of&#10;these was the home of the swallow who carried Tiny.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;This is my house,&#34; said the swallow; &#34;but it would not do&#10;for you to live there&#8212;you would not be comfortable. You must choose&#10;for yourself one of those lovely flowers, and I will put you down&#10;upon it, and then you shall have everything that you can wish to&#10;make you happy.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That will be delightful,&#34; she said, and clapped her&#10;little hands for joy.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A large marble pillar lay on the ground, which, in&#10;falling, had been broken into three pieces. Between these pieces&#10;grew the most beautiful large white flowers; so the swallow flew&#10;down with Tiny, and placed her on one of the broad leaves. But how&#10;surprised she was to see in the middle of the flower, a tiny little&#10;man, as white and transparent as if he had been made of crystal! He&#10;had a gold crown on his head, and delicate wings at his shoulders,&#10;and was not much larger than Tiny herself. He was the angel of the&#10;flower; for a tiny man and a tiny woman dwell in every flower; and&#10;this was the king of them all.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, how beautiful he is!&#34; whispered Tiny to the&#10;swallow.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The little prince was at first quite frightened at the&#10;bird, who was like a giant, compared to such a delicate little&#10;creature as himself; but when he saw Tiny, he was delighted, and&#10;thought her the prettiest little maiden he had ever seen. He took&#10;the gold crown from his head, and placed it on hers, and asked her&#10;name, and if she would be his wife, and queen over all the&#10;flowers.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;This certainly was a very different sort of husband to the&#10;son of a toad, or the mole, with my black velvet and fur; so she&#10;said, &#34;Yes,&#34; to the handsome prince. Then all the flowers opened,&#10;and out of each came a little lady or a tiny lord, all so pretty it&#10;was quite a pleasure to look at them. Each of them brought Tiny a&#10;present; but the best gift was a pair of beautiful wings, which had&#10;belonged to a large white fly and they fastened them to Tiny&#39;s&#10;shoulders, so that she might fly from flower to flower. Then there&#10;was much rejoicing, and the little swallow who sat above them, in&#10;his nest, was asked to sing a wedding song, which he did as well as&#10;he could; but in his heart he felt sad for he was very fond of&#10;Tiny, and would have liked never to part from her again.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You must not be called Tiny any more,&#34; said the spirit of&#10;the flowers to her. &#34;It is an ugly name, and you are so very&#10;pretty. We will call you Maia.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Farewell, farewell,&#34; said the swallow, with a heavy heart&#10;as he left the warm countries to fly back into Denmark. There he&#10;had a nest over the window of a house in which dwelt the writer of&#10;fairy tales. The swallow sang, &#34;Tweet, tweet,&#34; and from his song&#10;came the whole story. &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)

It was all very well for those who knew&#10;him, but not for strangers.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Little Tuk was left at home to take care of his little&#10;sister, Gustava, who was much younger than himself, and he had to&#10;learn his lessons at the same time, and the two things could not&#10;very well be performed together. The poor boy sat there with his&#10;sister on his lap, and sung to her all the songs he knew, and now&#10;and then he looked into his geography lesson that lay open before&#10;him. By the next morning he had to learn by heart all the towns in&#10;Zealand, and all that could be described of them.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;His mother came home at last, and took little Gustava in&#10;her arms. Then Tuk ran to the window, and read so eagerly that he&#10;nearly read his eyes out; for it had become darker and darker every&#10;minute, and his mother had no money to buy a light.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;There goes the old washerwoman up the lane,&#34; said the&#10;mother, as she looked out of the window; &#34;the poor woman can hardly&#10;drag herself along, and now she had to drag a pail of water from&#10;the well. Be a good boy, Tuk, and run across and help the old&#10;woman, won&#39;t you?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;So Tuk ran across quickly, and helped her, but when he&#10;came back into the room it was quite dark, and there was not a word&#10;said about a light, so he was obliged to go to bed on his little&#10;truckle bedstead, and there he lay and thought of his geography&#10;lesson, and of Zealand, and of all the master had told him. He&#10;ought really to have read it over again, but he could not for want&#10;of light. So he put the geography book under his pillow, for he had&#10;heard that this was a great help towards learning a lesson, but not&#10;always to be depended upon. He still lay thinking and thinking,&#10;when all at once it seemed as if some one kissed him on his eyes&#10;and mouth. He slept and yet he did not sleep; and it appeared as if&#10;the old washerwoman looked at him with kind eyes and said, &#34;It&#10;would be a great pity if you did not know your lesson to-morrow&#10;morning; you helped me, and now I will help you, and Providence&#10;will always keep those who help themselves;&#34; and at the same time&#10;the book under Tuk&#39;s pillow began to move about. &#34;Cluck, cluck,&#10;cluck,&#34; cried a hen as she crept towards him. &#34;I am a hen from&#10;Kjoge,&#34; and then she told him how many inhabitants the town&#10;contained, and about a battle that had been fought there, which&#10;really was not worth speaking of.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Crack, crack,&#34; down fell something. It was a wooden bird,&#10;the parrot which is used as a target as Prastoe. He said there were&#10;as many inhabitants in that town as he had nails in his body. He&#10;was very proud, and said, &#34;Thorwalsden lived close to me, and here&#10;I am now, quite comfortable.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But now little Tuk was no longer in bed; all in a moment&#10;he found himself on horseback. Gallop, gallop, away he went, seated&#10;in front of a richly-attired knight, with a waving plume, who held&#10;him on the saddle, and so they rode through the wood by the old&#10;town of Wordingburg, which was very large and busy. The king&#39;s&#10;castle was surrounded by lofty towers, and radiant light streamed&#10;from all the windows. Within there were songs and dancing; King&#10;Waldemar and the young gayly-dressed ladies of the court were&#10;dancing together. Morning dawned, and as the sun rose, the whole&#10;city and the king&#39;s castle sank suddenly down together. One tower&#10;after another fell, till at last only one remained standing on the&#10;hill where the castle had formerly been.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The town now appeared small and poor, and the school-boys&#10;read in their books, which they carried under their arms, that it&#10;contained two thousand inhabitants; but this was a mere boast, for&#10;it did not contain so many.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And again little Tuk lay in his bed, scarcely knowing&#10;whether he was dreaming or not, for some one stood by&#10;him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Tuk! little Tuk!&#34; said a voice. It was a very little&#10;person who spoke. He was dressed as a sailor, and looked small&#10;enough to be a middy, but he was not one. &#34;I bring you many&#10;greetings from Corsor. It is a rising town, full of life. It has&#10;steamships and mail-coaches. In times past they used to call it&#10;ugly, but that is no longer true. I lie on the sea-shore,&#34; said&#10;Corsor; &#34;I have high-roads and pleasure-gardens; I have given birth&#10;to a poet who was witty and entertaining, which they are not all. I&#10;once wanted to fit out a ship to sail round the world, but I did&#10;not accomplish it, though most likely I might have done so. But I&#10;am fragrant with perfume, for close to my gates most lovely roses&#10;bloom.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then before the eyes of little Tuk appeared a confusion of&#10;colors, red and green; but it cleared off, and he could distinguish&#10;a cliff close to the bay, the slopes of which were quite overgrown&#10;with verdure, and on its summit stood a fine old church with&#10;pointed towers. Springs of water flowed out of the cliff in thick&#10;waterspouts, so that there was a continual splashing. Close by sat&#10;an old king with a golden crown on his white head. This was King&#10;Hroar of the Springs and near the springs stood the town of&#10;Roeskilde, as it is called. Then all the kings and queens of&#10;Denmark went up the ascent to the old church, hand in hand, with&#10;golden crowns on their heads, while the organ played and the&#10;fountains sent forth jets of water.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Little Tuk saw and heard it all. &#34;Don&#39;t forget the names&#10;of these towns,&#34; said King Hroar.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;All at once everything vanished; but where! It seemed to&#10;him like turning over the leaves of a book. And now there stood&#10;before him an old peasant woman, who had come from Soroe where the&#10;grass grows in the market-place. She had a green linen apron thrown&#10;over her head and shoulders, and it was quite wet, as if it had&#10;been raining heavily. &#34;Yes, that it has,&#34; said she, and then, just&#10;as she was going to tell him a great many pretty stories from&#10;Holberg&#39;s comedies, and about Waldemar and Absalom, she suddenly&#10;shrunk up together, and wagged her head as if she were a frog about&#10;to spring. &#34;Croak,&#34; she cried; &#34;it is always wet, and as quiet as&#10;death in Soroe.&#34; Then little Tuk saw she was changed into a frog.&#10;&#34;Croak,&#34; and again she was an old woman. &#34;One must dress according&#10;to the weather,&#34; said she. &#34;It is wet, and my town is just like a&#10;bottle. By the cork we must go in, and by the cork we must come out&#10;again. In olden times I had beautiful fish, and now I have fresh,&#10;rosy-cheeked boys in the bottom of the bottle, and they learn&#10;wisdom, Hebrew and Greek.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Croak.&#34; How it sounded like the cry of the frogs on the&#10;moor, or like the creaking of great boots when some one is&#10;marching,&#8212;always the same tone, so monotonous and wearing, that&#10;little Tuk at length fell fast asleep, and then the sound could not&#10;annoy him. But even in this sleep came a dream or something like&#10;it. His little sister Gustava, with her blue eyes, and fair curly&#10;hair, had grown up a beautiful maiden all at once, and without&#10;having wings she could fly. And they flew together over Zealand,&#10;over green forests and blue lakes.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Hark, so you hear the cock crow, little Tuk.&#10;&#39;Cock-a-doodle-doo.&#39; The fowls are flying out of Kjoge. You shall&#10;have a large farm-yard. You shall never suffer hunger or want. The&#10;bird of good omen shall be yours, and you shall become a rich and&#10;happy man; your house shall rise up like King Waldemar&#39;s towers,&#10;and shall be richly adorned with marble statues, like those at&#10;Prastoe. Understand me well; your name shall travel with fame round&#10;the world like the ship that was to sail from Corsor, and at&#10;Roeskilde,&#8212;Don&#39;t forget the names of the towns, as King Hroar&#10;said,&#8212;you shall speak well and clearly little Tuk, and when at last&#10;you lie in your grave you shall sleep peacefully, as-&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;As if I lay in Soroe,&#34; said little Tuk awaking. It was&#10;bright daylight, and he could not remember his dream, but that was&#10;not necessary, for we are not to know what will happen to us in the&#10;future. Then he sprang out of bed quickly, and read over his lesson&#10;in the book, and knew it all at once quite correctly. The old&#10;washerwoman put her head in at the door, and nodded to him quite&#10;kindly, and said, &#34;Many thanks, you good child, for your help&#10;yesterday.

She specially loved roses, and therefore she possessed&#10;the most beautiful varieties of this flower, from the wild&#10;hedge-rose, with its apple-scented leaves, to the splendid Provence&#10;rose. They grew near the shelter of the walls, wound themselves&#10;round columns and window-frames, crept along passages and over the&#10;ceilings of the halls. They were of every fragrance and&#10;color.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But care and sorrow dwelt within these halls; the queen&#10;lay upon a sick bed, and the doctors declared that she must die.&#10;&#34;There is still one thing that could save her,&#34; said one of the&#10;wisest among them. &#34;Bring her the loveliest rose in the world; one&#10;which exhibits the purest and brightest love, and if it is brought&#10;to her before her eyes close, she will not die.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then from all parts came those who brought roses that&#10;bloomed in every garden, but they were not the right sort. The&#10;flower must be one from the garden of love; but which of the roses&#10;there showed forth the highest and purest love? The poets sang of&#10;this rose, the loveliest in the world, and each named one which he&#10;considered worthy of that title; and intelligence of what was&#10;required was sent far and wide to every heart that beat with love;&#10;to every class, age, and condition.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No one has yet named the flower,&#34; said the wise man. &#34;No&#10;one has pointed out the spot where it blooms in all its splendor.&#10;It is not a rose from the coffin of Romeo and Juliet, or from the&#10;grave of Walburg, though these roses will live in everlasting song.&#10;It is not one of the roses which sprouted forth from the&#10;blood-stained fame of Winkelreid. The blood which flows from the&#10;breast of a hero who dies for his country is sacred, and his memory&#10;is sweet, and no rose can be redder than the blood which flows from&#10;his veins. Neither is it the magic flower of Science, to obtain&#10;which wondrous flower a man devotes many an hour of his fresh young&#10;life in sleepless nights, in a lonely chamber.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I know where it blooms,&#34; said a happy mother, who came&#10;with her lovely child to the bedside of the queen. &#34;I know where&#10;the loveliest rose in the world is. It is seen on the blooming&#10;cheeks of my sweet child, when it expresses the pure and holy love&#10;of infancy; when refreshed by sleep it opens its eyes, and smiles&#10;upon me with childlike affection.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;This is a lovely rose,&#34; said the wise man; &#34;but there is&#10;one still more lovely.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, one far more lovely,&#34; said one of the women. &#34;I have&#10;seen it, and a loftier and purer rose does not bloom. But it was&#10;white, like the leaves of a blush-rose. I saw it on the cheeks of&#10;the queen. She had taken off her golden crown, and through the&#10;long, dreary night, she carried her sick child in her arms. She&#10;wept over it, kissed it, and prayed for it as only a mother can&#10;pray in that hour of her anguish.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Holy and wonderful in its might is the white rose of&#10;grief, but it is not the one we seek.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No; the loveliest rose in the world I saw at the Lord&#39;s&#10;table,&#34; said the good old bishop. &#34;I saw it shine as if an angel&#39;s&#10;face had appeared. A young maiden knelt at the altar, and renewed&#10;the vows made at her baptism; and there were white roses and red&#10;roses on the blushing cheeks of that young girl. She looked up to&#10;heaven with all the purity and love of her young spirit, in all the&#10;expression of the highest and purest love.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;May she be blessed!&#34; said the wise man: &#34;but no one has&#10;yet named the loveliest rose in the world.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then there came into the room a child&#8212;the queen&#39;s little&#10;son. Tears stood in his eyes, and glistened on his cheeks; he&#10;carried a great book and the binding was of velvet, with silver&#10;clasps. &#34;Mother,&#34; cried the little boy; &#34;only hear what I have&#10;read.&#34; And the child seated himself by the bedside, and read from&#10;the book of Him who suffered death on the cross to save all men,&#10;even who are yet unborn. He read, &#34;Greater love hath no man than&#10;this,&#34; and as he read a roseate hue spread over the cheeks of the&#10;queen, and her eyes became so enlightened and clear, that she saw&#10;from the leaves of the book a lovely rose spring forth, a type of&#10;Him who shed His blood on the cross.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I see it,&#34; she said. &#34;He who beholds this, the loveliest&#10;rose on earth, shall never die.&#34; &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Mail-Coach Passengers'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;IT was bitterly cold, the sky glittered with stars, and&#10;not a breeze stirred. &#34;Bump&#34;&#8212;an old pot was thrown at a neighbor&#39;s&#10;door; and &#34;bang, bang,&#34; went the guns; for they were greeting the&#10;New Year. It was New Year&#39;s Eve, and the church clock was striking&#10;twelve. &#34;Tan-ta-ra-ra, tan-ta-ra-ra,&#34; sounded the horn, and the&#10;mail-coach came lumbering up. The clumsy vehicle stopped at the&#10;gate of the town; all the places had been taken, for there were&#10;twelve passengers in the coach.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Hurrah! hurrah!&#34; cried the people in the town; for in&#10;every house the New Year was being welcomed; and as the clock&#10;struck, they stood up, the full glasses in their hands, to drink&#10;success to the new comer. &#34;A happy New Year,&#34; was the cry; &#34;a&#10;pretty wife, plenty of money, and no sorrow or care.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The wish passed round, and the glasses clashed together&#10;till they rang again; while before the town-gate the mail coach&#10;stopped with the twelve strange passengers. And who were these&#10;strangers? Each of them had his passport and his luggage with him;&#10;they even brought presents for me, and for you, and for all the&#10;people in the town. &#34;Who were they? what did they want? and what&#10;did they bring with them?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Good-morning,&#34; they cried to the sentry at the&#10;town-gate.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Good-morning,&#34; replied the sentry; for the clock had&#10;struck twelve. &#34;Your name and profession?&#34; asked the sentry of the&#10;one who alighted first from the carriage.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;See for yourself in the passport,&#34; he replied. &#34;I am&#10;myself;&#34; and a famous fellow he looked, arrayed in bear-skin and&#10;fur boots. &#34;I am the man on whom many persons fix their hopes. Come&#10;to me to-morrow, and I&#39;ll give you a New Year&#39;s present. I throw&#10;shillings and pence among the people; I give balls, no less than&#10;thirty-one; indeed, that is the highest number I can spare for&#10;balls. My ships are often frozen in, but in my offices it is warm&#10;and comfortable. My name is JANUARY. I&#39;m a merchant, and I&#10;generally bring my accounts with me.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the second alighted. He seemed a merry fellow. He was&#10;a director of a theatre, a manager of masked balls, and a leader of&#10;all the amusements we can imagine. His luggage consisted of a great&#10;cask.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;We&#39;ll dance the bung out of the cask at carnival time,&#34;&#10;said he; &#34;I&#39;ll prepare a merry tune for you and for myself too.&#10;Unfortunately I have not long to live&#8212;the shortest time, in fact,&#10;of my whole family&#8212;only twenty-eight days. Sometimes they pop me in&#10;a day extra; but I trouble myself very little about that.&#10;Hurrah!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You must not shout so,&#34; said the sentry.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Certainly I may shout,&#34; retorted the man; &#34;I&#39;m Prince&#10;Carnival, travelling under the name of FEBRUARY.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The third now got out. He looked a personification of&#10;fasting; but he carried his nose very high, for he was related to&#10;the &#34;forty (k)nights,&#34; and was a weather prophet. But that is not a&#10;very lucrative office, and therefore he praised fasting. In his&#10;button-hole he carried a little bunch of violets, but they were&#10;very small.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;MARCH, March,&#34; the fourth called after him, slapping him&#10;on the shoulder, &#34;don&#39;t you smell something? Make haste into the&#10;guard room; they&#39;re drinking punch there; that&#39;s your favorite&#10;drink. I can smell it out here already. Forward, Master March.&#34; But&#10;it was not true; the speaker only wanted to remind him of his name,&#10;and to make an APRIL fool of him; for with that fun the fourth&#10;generally began his career. He looked very jovial, did little work,&#10;and had the more holidays. &#34;If the world were only a little more&#10;settled,&#34; said he: &#34;but sometimes I&#39;m obliged to be in a good&#10;humor, and sometimes a bad one, according to circumstances; now&#10;rain, now sunshine. I&#39;m kind of a house agent, also a manager of&#10;funerals. I can laugh or cry, according to circumstances. I have my&#10;summer wardrobe in this box here, but it would be very foolish to&#10;put it on now. Here I am. On Sundays I go out walking in shoes and&#10;white silk stockings, and a muff.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;After him, a lady stepped out of the coach. She called&#10;herself Miss MAY. She wore a summer dress and overshoes; her dress&#10;was a light green, and she wore anemones in her hair. She was so&#10;scented with wild-thyme, that it made the sentry sneeze.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Your health, and God bless you,&#34; was her salutation to&#10;him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;How pretty she was! and such a singer! not a theatre&#10;singer, nor a ballad singer; no, but a singer of the woods; for she&#10;wandered through the gay green forest, and had a concert there for&#10;her own amusement.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Now comes the young lady,&#34; said those in the carriage;&#10;and out stepped a young dame, delicate, proud, and pretty. It was&#10;Mistress JUNE, in whose service people become lazy and fond of&#10;sleeping for hours. She gives a feast on the longest day of the&#10;year, that there may be time for her guests to partake of the&#10;numerous dishes at her table. Indeed, she keeps her own carriage;&#10;but still she travelled by the mail, with the rest, because she&#10;wished to show that she was not high-minded. But she was not&#10;without a protector; her younger brother, JULY, was with her. He&#10;was a plump young fellow, clad in summer garments and wearing a&#10;straw hat. He had but very little luggage with him, because it was&#10;so cumbersome in the great heat; he had, however, swimming-trousers&#10;with him, which are nothing to carry. Then came the mother herself,&#10;in crinoline, Madame AUGUST, a wholesale dealer in fruit,&#10;proprietress of a large number of fish ponds and a land cultivator.&#10;She was fat and heated, yet she could use her hands well, and would&#10;herself carry out beer to the laborers in the field. &#34;In the sweat&#10;of the face shalt thou eat bread,&#34; said she; &#34;it is written in the&#10;Bible.&#34; After work, came the recreations, dancing and playing in&#10;the greenwood, and the &#34;harvest homes.&#34; She was a thorough&#10;housewife.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;After her a man came out of the coach, who is a painter;&#10;he is the great master of colors, and is named SEPTEMBER. The&#10;forest, on his arrival, had to change its colors when he wished it;&#10;and how beautiful are the colors he chooses! The woods glow with&#10;hues of red and gold and brown. This great master painter could&#10;whistle like a blackbird. He was quick in his work, and soon&#10;entwined the tendrils of the hop plant around his beer jug. This&#10;was an ornament to the jug, and he has a great love for ornament.&#10;There he stood with his color pot in his hand, and that was the&#10;whole of his luggage. A land-owner followed, who in the month for&#10;sowing seed attended to the ploughing and was fond of field sports.&#10;Squire OCTOBER brought his dog and his gun with him, and had nuts&#10;in his game bag. &#34;Crack, crack.&#34; He had a great deal of luggage,&#10;even an English plough. He spoke of farming, but what he said could&#10;scarcely be heard for the coughing and gasping of his neighbor. It&#10;was NOVEMBER, who coughed violently as he got out. He had a cold,&#10;which caused him to use his pocket-handkerchief continually; and&#10;yet he said he was obliged to accompany servant girls to their new&#10;places, and initiate them into their winter service. He said he&#10;thought his cold would never leave him when he went out&#10;woodcutting, for he was a master sawyer, and had to supply wood to&#10;the whole parish. He spent his evenings preparing wooden soles for&#10;skates, for he knew, he said, that in a few weeks these shoes would&#10;be wanted for the amusement of skating. At length the last&#10;passenger made her appearance,&#8212;old Mother DECEMBER, with her&#10;fire-stool. The dame was very old, but her eyes glistened like two&#10;stars. She carried on her arm a flower-pot, in which a little&#10;fir-tree was growing. &#34;This tree I shall guard and cherish,&#34; she&#10;said, &#34;that it may grow large by Christmas Eve, and reach from the&#10;ground to the ceiling, to be covered and adorned with flaming&#10;candles, golden apples, and little figures. The fire-stool will be&#10;as warm as a stove, and I shall then bring a story book out of my&#10;pocket, and read aloud till all the children in the room are quite&#10;quiet. Then the little figures on the tree will become lively, and&#10;the little waxen angel at the top spread out his wings of&#10;gold-leaf, and fly down from his green perch. He will kiss every&#10;one in the room, great and small; yes, even the poor children who&#10;stand in the passage, or out in the street singing a carol about&#10;the &#39;Star of Bethlehem.&#39;&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Well, now the coach may drive away,&#34; said the sentry; &#34;we&#10;have the whole twelve. Let the horses be put up.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;First, let all the twelve come to me,&#34; said the captain&#10;on duty, &#34;one after another. The passports I will keep here. Each&#10;of them is available for one month; when that has passed, I shall&#10;write the behavior of each on his passport. Mr. JANUARY, have the&#10;goodness to come here.&#34; And Mr. January stepped forward.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;When a year has passed, I think I shall be able to tell&#10;you what the twelve passengers have brought to you, to me, and to&#10;all of us. Now I do not know, and probably even they don&#39;t know&#10;themselves, for we live in strange times. &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Marsh King&#39;s Daughter'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;THE storks relate to their little ones a great many&#10;stories, and they are all about moors and reed banks, and suited to&#10;their age and capacity. The youngest of them are quite satisfied&#10;with &#34;kribble, krabble,&#34; or such nonsense, and think it very grand;&#10;but the elder ones want something with a deeper meaning, or at&#10;least something about their own family.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;We are only acquainted with one of the two longest and&#10;oldest stories which the storks relate&#8212;it is about Moses, who was&#10;exposed by his mother on the banks of the Nile, and was found by&#10;the king&#39;s daughter, who gave him a good education, and he&#10;afterwards became a great man; but where he was buried is still&#10;unknown.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Every one knows this story, but not the second; very&#10;likely because it is quite an inland story. It has been repeated&#10;from mouth to mouth, from one stork-mamma to another, for thousands&#10;of years; and each has told it better than the last; and now we&#10;mean to tell it better than all.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The first stork pair who related it lived at the time it&#10;happened, and had their summer residence on the rafters of the&#10;Viking&#39;s house, which stood near the wild moorlands of Wendsyssell;&#10;that is, to speak more correctly, the great moorheath, high up in&#10;the north of Jutland, by the Skjagen peak. This wilderness is still&#10;an immense wild heath of marshy ground, about which we can read in&#10;the &#34;Official Directory.&#34; It is said that in olden times the place&#10;was a lake, the ground of which had heaved up from beneath, and now&#10;the moorland extends for miles in every direction, and is&#10;surrounded by damp meadows, trembling, undulating swamps, and&#10;marshy ground covered with turf, on which grow bilberry bushes and&#10;stunted trees. Mists are almost always hovering over this region,&#10;which, seventy years ago, was overrun with wolves. It may well be&#10;called the Wild Moor; and one can easily imagine, with such a wild&#10;expanse of marsh and lake, how lonely and dreary it must have been&#10;a thousand years ago. Many things may be noticed now that existed&#10;then. The reeds grow to the same height, and bear the same kind of&#10;long, purple-brown leaves, with their feathery tips. There still&#10;stands the birch, with its white bark and its delicate, loosely&#10;hanging leaves; and with regard to the living beings who frequented&#10;this spot, the fly still wears a gauzy dress of the same cut, and&#10;the favorite colors of the stork are white, with black and red for&#10;stockings. The people, certainly, in those days, wore very&#10;different dresses to those they now wear, but if any of them, be he&#10;huntsman or squire, master or servant, ventured on the wavering,&#10;undulating, marshy ground of the moor, they met with the same fate&#10;a thousand years ago as they would now. The wanderer sank, and went&#10;down to the Marsh King, as he is named, who rules in the great&#10;moorland empire beneath. They also called him &#34;Gunkel King,&#34; but we&#10;like the name of &#34;Marsh King&#34; better, and we will give him that&#10;name as the storks do. Very little is known of the Marsh King&#39;s&#10;rule, but that, perhaps, is a good thing.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the neighborhood of the moorlands, and not far from the&#10;great arm of the North Sea and the Cattegat which is called the&#10;Lumfjorden, lay the castle of the Viking, with its water-tight&#10;stone cellars, its tower, and its three projecting storeys. On the&#10;ridge of the roof the stork had built his nest, and there the&#10;stork-mamma sat on her eggs and felt sure her hatching would come&#10;to something.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;One evening, stork-papa stayed out rather late, and when&#10;he came home he seemed quite busy, bustling, and important. &#34;I have&#10;something very dreadful to tell you,&#34; said he to the&#10;stork-mamma.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Keep it to yourself then,&#34; she replied. &#34;Remember that I&#10;am hatching eggs; it may agitate me, and will affect&#10;them.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You must know it at once,&#34; said he. &#34;The daughter of our&#10;host in Egypt has arrived here. She has ventured to take this&#10;journey, and now she is lost.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;She who sprung from the race of the fairies, is it?&#34;&#10;cried the mother stork. &#34;Oh, tell me all about it; you know I&#10;cannot bear to be kept waiting at a time when I am hatching&#10;eggs.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Well, you see, mother,&#34; he replied, &#34;she believed what&#10;the doctors said, and what I have heard you state also, that the&#10;moor-flowers which grow about here would heal her sick father; and&#10;she has flown to the north in swan&#39;s plumage, in company with some&#10;other swan-princesses, who come to these parts every year to renew&#10;their youth. She came, and where is she now!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You enter into particulars too much,&#34; said the mamma&#10;stork, &#34;and the eggs may take cold; I cannot bear such suspense as&#10;this.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Well,&#34; said he, &#34;I have kept watch; and this evening I&#10;went among the rushes where I thought the marshy ground would bear&#10;me, and while I was there three swans came. Something in their&#10;manner of flying seemed to say to me, &#39;Look carefully now; there is&#10;one not all swan, only swan&#39;s feathers.&#39; You know, mother, you have&#10;the same intuitive feeling that I have; you know whether a thing is&#10;right or not immediately.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, of course,&#34; said she; &#34;but tell me about the&#10;princess; I am tired of hearing about the swan&#39;s&#10;feathers.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Well, you know that in the middle of the moor there is&#10;something like a lake,&#34; said the stork-papa. &#34;You can see the edge&#10;of it if you raise yourself a little. Just there, by the reeds and&#10;the green banks, lay the trunk of an elder-tree; upon this the&#10;three swans stood flapping their wings, and looking about them; one&#10;of them threw off her plumage, and I immediately recognized her as&#10;one of the princesses of our home in Egypt. There she sat, without&#10;any covering but her long, black hair. I heard her tell the two&#10;others to take great care of the swan&#39;s plumage, while she dipped&#10;down into the water to pluck the flowers which she fancied she saw&#10;there. The others nodded, and picked up the feather dress, and took&#10;possession of it. I wonder what will become of it? thought I, and&#10;she most likely asked herself the same question. If so, she&#10;received an answer, a very practical one; for the two swans rose up&#10;and flew away with her swan&#39;s plumage. &#39;Dive down now!&#39; they cried;&#10;&#39;thou shalt never more fly in the swan&#39;s plumage, thou shalt never&#10;again see Egypt; here, on the moor, thou wilt remain.&#39; So saying,&#10;they tore the swan&#39;s plumage into a thousand pieces, the feathers&#10;drifted about like a snow-shower, and then the two deceitful&#10;princesses flew away.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Why, that is terrible,&#34; said the stork-mamma; &#34;I feel as&#10;if I could hardly bear to hear any more, but you must tell me what&#10;happened next.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The princess wept and lamented aloud; her tears moistened&#10;the elder stump, which was really not an elder stump but the Marsh&#10;King himself, he who in marshy ground lives and rules. I saw myself&#10;how the stump of the tree turned round, and was a tree no more,&#10;while long, clammy branches like arms, were extended from it. Then&#10;the poor child was terribly frightened, and started up to run away.&#10;She hastened to cross the green, slimy ground; but it will not bear&#10;any weight, much less hers. She quickly sank, and the elder stump&#10;dived immediately after her; in fact, it was he who drew her down.&#10;Great black bubbles rose up out of the moor-slime, and with these&#10;every trace of the two vanished. And now the princess is buried in&#10;the wild marsh, she will never now carry flowers to Egypt to cure&#10;her father. It would have broken your heart, mother, had you seen&#10;it.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You ought not to have told me,&#34; said she, &#34;at such a time&#10;as this; the eggs might suffer. But I think the princess will soon&#10;find help; some one will rise up to help her. Ah! if it had been&#10;you or I, or one of our people, it would have been all over with&#10;us.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;I mean to go every day,&#34; said he, &#34;to see if anything&#10;comes to pass;&#34; and so he did.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A long time went by, but at last he saw a green stalk&#10;shooting up out of the deep, marshy ground. As it reached the&#10;surface of the marsh, a leaf spread out, and unfolded itself&#10;broader and broader, and close to it came forth a bud.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;One morning, when the stork-papa was flying over the stem,&#10;he saw that the power of the sun&#39;s rays had caused the bud to open,&#10;and in the cup of the flower lay a charming child&#8212;a little maiden,&#10;looking as if she had just come out of a bath. The little one was&#10;so like the Egyptian princess, that the stork, at the first moment,&#10;thought it must be the princess herself, but after a little&#10;reflection he decided that it was much more likely to be the&#10;daughter of the princess and the Marsh King; and this explained&#10;also her being placed in the cup of a water-lily. &#34;But she cannot&#10;be left to lie here,&#34; thought the stork, &#34;and in my nest there are&#10;already so many. But stay, I have thought of something: the wife of&#10;the Viking has no children, and how often she has wished for a&#10;little one. People always say the stork brings the little ones; I&#10;will do so in earnest this time. I shall fly with the child to the&#10;Viking&#39;s wife; what rejoicing there will be!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And then the stork lifted the little girl out of the&#10;flower-cup, flew to the castle, picked a hole with his beak in the&#10;bladder-covered, window, and laid the beautiful child in the bosom&#10;of the Viking&#39;s wife. Then he flew back quickly to the stork-mamma&#10;and told her what he had seen and done; and the little storks&#10;listened to it all, for they were then quite old enough to do so.&#10;&#34;So you see,&#34; he continued, &#34;that the princess is not dead, for she&#10;must have sent her little one up here; and now I have found a home&#10;for her.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ah, I said it would be so from the first,&#34; replied the&#10;stork-mamma; &#34;but now think a little of your own family. Our&#10;travelling time draws near, and I sometimes feel a little&#10;irritation already under the wings. The cuckoos and the nightingale&#10;are already gone, and I heard the quails say they should go too as&#10;soon as the wind was favorable. Our youngsters will go through all&#10;the manoeuvres at the review very well, or I am much mistaken in&#10;them.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Viking&#39;s wife was above measure delighted when she&#10;awoke the next morning and found the beautiful little child lying&#10;in her bosom. She kissed it and caressed it; but it cried terribly,&#10;and struck out with its arms and legs, and did not seem to be&#10;pleased at all. At last it cried itself to sleep; and as it lay&#10;there so still and quiet, it was a most beautiful sight to see. The&#10;Viking&#39;s wife was so delighted, that body and soul were full of&#10;joy. Her heart felt so light within her, that it seemed as if her&#10;husband and his soldiers, who were absent, must come home as&#10;suddenly and unexpectedly as the little child had done. She and her&#10;whole household therefore busied themselves in preparing everything&#10;for the reception of her lord. The long, colored tapestry, on which&#10;she and her maidens had worked pictures of their idols, Odin, Thor,&#10;and Friga, was hung up. The slaves polished the old shields that&#10;served as ornaments; cushions were placed on the seats, and dry&#10;wood laid on the fireplaces in the centre of the hall, so that the&#10;flames might be fanned up at a moment&#39;s notice. The Viking&#39;s wife&#10;herself assisted in the work, so that at night she felt very tired,&#10;and quickly fell into a sound sleep. When she awoke, just before&#10;morning, she was terribly alarmed to find that the infant had&#10;vanished. She sprang from her couch, lighted a pine-chip, and&#10;searched all round the room, when, at last, in that part of the bed&#10;where her feet had been, lay, not the child, but a great, ugly&#10;frog. She was quite disgusted at this sight, and seized a heavy&#10;stick to kill the frog; but the creature looked at her with such&#10;strange, mournful eyes, that she was unable to strike the blow.&#10;Once more she searched round the room; then she started at hearing&#10;the frog utter a low, painful croak. She sprang from the couch and&#10;opened the window hastily; at the same moment the sun rose, and&#10;threw its beams through the window, till it rested on the couch&#10;where the great frog lay. Suddenly it appeared as if the frog&#39;s&#10;broad mouth contracted, and became small and red. The limbs moved&#10;and stretched out and extended themselves till they took a&#10;beautiful shape; and behold there was the pretty child lying before&#10;her, and the ugly frog was gone. &#34;How is this?&#34; she cried, &#34;have I&#10;had a wicked dream? Is it not my own lovely cherub that lies&#10;there.&#34; Then she kissed it and fondled it; but the child struggled&#10;and fought, and bit as if she had been a little wild&#10;cat.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Viking did not return on that day, nor the next; he&#10;was, however, on the way home; but the wind, so favorable to the&#10;storks, was against him; for it blew towards the south. A wind in&#10;favor of one is often against another.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;After two or three days had passed, it became clear to the&#10;Viking&#39;s wife how matters stood with the child; it was under the&#10;influence of a powerful sorcerer. By day it was charming in&#10;appearance as an angel of light, but with a temper wicked and wild;&#10;while at night, in the form of an ugly frog, it was quiet and&#10;mournful, with eyes full of sorrow. Here were two natures, changing&#10;inwardly and outwardly with the absence and return of sunlight. And&#10;so it happened that by day the child, with the actual form of its&#10;mother, possessed the fierce disposition of its father; at night,&#10;on the contrary, its outward appearance plainly showed its descent&#10;on the father&#39;s side, while inwardly it had the heart and mind of&#10;its mother. Who would be able to loosen this wicked charm which the&#10;sorcerer had worked upon it? The wife of the Viking lived in&#10;constant pain and sorrow about it. Her heart clung to the little&#10;creature, but she could not explain to her husband the&#10;circumstances in which it was placed. He was expected to return&#10;shortly; and were she to tell him, he would very likely, as was the&#10;custom at that time, expose the poor child in the public highway,&#10;and let any one take it away who would. The good wife of the Viking&#10;could not let that happen, and she therefore resolved that the&#10;Viking should never see the child excepting by daylight.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;One morning there sounded a rushing of storks&#39; wings over&#10;the roof. More than a hundred pair of storks had rested there&#10;during the night, to recover themselves after their excursion; and&#10;now they soared aloft, and prepared for the journey&#10;southward.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;All the husbands are here, and ready!&#34; they cried; &#34;wives&#10;and children also!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;How light we are!&#34; screamed the young storks in chorus.&#10;&#34;Something pleasant seems creeping over us, even down to our toes,&#10;as if we were full of live frogs. Ah, how delightful it is to&#10;travel into foreign lands!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Hold yourselves properly in the line with us,&#34; cried papa&#10;and mamma. &#34;Do not use your beaks so much; it tries the lungs.&#34; And&#10;then the storks flew away.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;About the same time sounded the clang of the warriors&#39;&#10;trumpets across the heath. The Viking had landed with his men. They&#10;were returning home, richly laden with spoil from the Gallic coast,&#10;where the people, as did also the inhabitants of Britain, often&#10;cried in alarm, &#34;Deliver us from the wild northmen.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Life and noisy pleasure came with them into the castle of&#10;the Viking on the moorland. A great cask of mead was drawn into the&#10;hall, piles of wood blazed, cattle were slain and served up, that&#10;they might feast in reality, The priest who offered the sacrifice&#10;sprinkled the devoted parishioners with the warm blood; the fire&#10;crackled, and the smoke rolled along beneath the roof; the soot&#10;fell upon them from the beams; but they were used to all these&#10;things. Guests were invited, and received handsome presents. All&#10;wrongs and unfaithfulness were forgotten. They drank deeply, and&#10;threw in each other&#39;s faces the bones that were left, which was&#10;looked upon as a sign of good feeling amongst them. A bard, who was&#10;a kind of musician as well as warrior, and who had been with the&#10;Viking in his expedition, and knew what to sing about, gave them&#10;one of his best songs, in which they heard all their warlike deeds&#10;praised, and every wonderful action brought forward with honor.&#10;Every verse ended with this refrain,&#8212;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Gold and possessions will flee away,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Friends and foes must die one day;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Every man on earth must die,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;But a famous name will never die.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And with that they beat upon their shields, and hammered&#10;upon the table with knives and bones, in a most outrageous&#10;manner.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Viking&#39;s wife sat upon a raised cross seat in the open&#10;hall. She wore a silk dress, golden bracelets, and large amber&#10;beads. She was in costly attire, and the bard named her in his&#10;song, and spoke of the rich treasure of gold which she had brought&#10;to her husband. Her husband had already seen the wonderfully&#10;beautiful child in the daytime, and was delighted with her beauty;&#10;even her wild ways pleased him. He said the little maiden would&#10;grow up to be a heroine, with the strong will and determination of&#10;a man. She would never wink her eyes, even if, in joke, an expert&#10;hand should attempt to cut off her eye-brows with a sharp&#10;sword.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The full cask of mead soon became empty, and a fresh one&#10;was brought in; for these were people who liked plenty to eat and&#10;drink. The old proverb, which every one knows, says that &#34;the&#10;cattle know when to leave their pasture, but a foolish man knows&#10;not the measure of his own appetite.&#34; Yes, they all knew this; but&#10;men may know what is right, and yet often do wrong. They also knew&#10;&#34;that even the welcome guest becomes wearisome when he sits too&#10;long in the house.&#34; But there they remained; for pork and mead are&#10;good things. And so at the Viking&#39;s house they stayed, and enjoyed&#10;themselves; and at night the bondmen slept in the ashes, and dipped&#10;their fingers in the fat, and licked them. Oh, it was a delightful&#10;time!&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Once more in the same year the Viking went forth, though&#10;the storms of autumn had already commenced to roar. He went with&#10;his warriors to the coast of Britain; he said that it was but an&#10;excursion of pleasure across the water, so his wife remained at&#10;home with the little girl. After a while, it is quite certain the&#10;foster-mother began to love the poor frog, with its gentle eyes and&#10;its deep sighs, even better than the little beauty who bit and&#10;fought with all around her.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The heavy, damp mists of autumn, which destroy the leaves&#10;of the wood, had already fallen upon forest and heath. Feathers of&#10;plucked birds, as they call the snow, flew about in thick showers,&#10;and winter was coming. The sparrows took possession of the stork&#39;s&#10;nest, and conversed about the absent owners in their own fashion;&#10;and they, the stork pair and all their young ones, where were they&#10;staying now? The storks might have been found in the land of Egypt,&#10;where the sun&#39;s rays shone forth bright and warm, as it does here&#10;at midsummer. Tamarinds and acacias were in full bloom all over the&#10;country, the crescent of Mahomet glittered brightly from the&#10;cupolas of the mosques, and on the slender pinnacles sat many of&#10;the storks, resting after their long journey. Swarms of them took&#10;divided possession of the nests&#8212;nests which lay close to each other&#10;between the venerable columns, and crowded the arches of temples in&#10;forgotten cities. The date and the palm lifted themselves as a&#10;screen or as a sun-shade over them. The gray pyramids looked like&#10;broken shadows in the clear air and the far-off desert, where the&#10;ostrich wheels his rapid flight, and the lion, with his subtle&#10;eyes, gazes at the marble sphinx which lies half buried in sand.&#10;The waters of the Nile had retreated, and the whole bed of the&#10;river was covered with frogs, which was a most acceptable prospect&#10;for the stork families. The young storks thought their eyes&#10;deceived them, everything around appeared so beautiful.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It is always like this here, and this is how we live in&#10;our warm country,&#34; said the stork-mamma; and the thought made the&#10;young ones almost beside themselves with pleasure.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Is there anything more to see?&#34; they asked; &#34;are we going&#10;farther into the country?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;There is nothing further for us to see,&#34; answered the&#10;stork-mamma. &#34;Beyond this delightful region there are immense&#10;forests, where the branches of the trees entwine round each other,&#10;while prickly, creeping plants cover the paths, and only an&#10;elephant could force a passage for himself with his great feet. The&#10;snakes are too large, and the lizards too lively for us to catch.&#10;Then there is the desert; if you went there, your eyes would soon&#10;be full of sand with the lightest breeze, and if it should blow&#10;great guns, you would most likely find yourself in a sand-drift.&#10;Here is the best place for you, where there are frogs and locusts;&#10;here I shall remain, and so must you.&#34; And so they&#10;stayed.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The parents sat in the nest on the slender minaret, and&#10;rested, yet still were busily employed in cleaning and smoothing&#10;their feathers, and in sharpening their beaks against their red&#10;stockings; then they would stretch out their necks, salute each&#10;other, and gravely raise their heads with the high-polished&#10;forehead, and soft, smooth feathers, while their brown eyes shone&#10;with intelligence. The female young ones strutted about amid the&#10;moist rushes, glancing at the other young storks and making&#10;acquaintances, and swallowing a frog at every third step, or&#10;tossing a little snake about with their beaks, in a way they&#10;considered very becoming, and besides it tasted very good. The&#10;young male storks soon began to quarrel; they struck at each other&#10;with their wings, and pecked with their beaks till the blood came.&#10;And in this manner many of the young ladies and gentlemen were&#10;betrothed to each other: it was, of course, what they wanted, and&#10;indeed what they lived for. Then they returned to a nest, and there&#10;the quarrelling began afresh; for in hot countries people are&#10;almost all violent and passionate. But for all that it was&#10;pleasant, especially for the old people, who watched them with&#10;great joy: all that their young ones did suited them. Every day&#10;here there was sunshine, plenty to eat, and nothing to think of but&#10;pleasure. But in the rich castle of their Egyptian host, as they&#10;called him, pleasure was not to be found. The rich and mighty lord&#10;of the castle lay on his couch, in the midst of the great hall,&#10;with its many colored walls looking like the centre of a great&#10;tulip; but he was stiff and powerless in all his limbs, and lay&#10;stretched out like a mummy. His family and servants stood round&#10;him; he was not dead, although he could scarcely be said to live.&#10;The healing moor-flower from the north, which was to have been&#10;found and brought to him by her who loved him so well, had not&#10;arrived. His young and beautiful daughter who, in swan&#39;s plumage,&#10;had flown over land and seas to the distant north, had never&#10;returned. She is dead, so the two swan-maidens had said when they&#10;came home; and they made up quite a story about her, and this is&#10;what they told,&#8212;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;We three flew away together through the air,&#34; said they:&#10;&#34;a hunter caught sight of us, and shot at us with an arrow. The&#10;arrow struck our young friend and sister, and slowly singing her&#10;farewell song she sank down, a dying swan, into the forest lake. On&#10;the shores of the lake, under a spreading birch-tree, we laid her&#10;in the cold earth. We had our revenge; we bound fire under the&#10;wings of a swallow, who had a nest on the thatched roof of the&#10;huntsman. The house took fire, and burst into flames; the hunter&#10;was burnt with the house, and the light was reflected over the sea&#10;as far as the spreading birch, beneath which we laid her sleeping&#10;dust. She will never return to the land of Egypt.&#34; And then they&#10;both wept. And stork-papa, who heard the story, snapped with his&#10;beak so that it might be heard a long way off.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#39;Deceit and lies!&#34; cried he; &#34;I should like to run my beak&#10;deep into their chests.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And perhaps break it off,&#34; said the mamma stork, &#34;then&#10;what a sight you would be. Think first of yourself, and then of&#10;your family; all others are nothing to us.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, I know,&#34; said the stork-papa; &#34;but to-morrow I can&#10;easily place myself on the edge of the open cupola, when the&#10;learned and wise men assemble to consult on the state of the sick&#10;man; perhaps they may come a little nearer to the truth.&#34; And the&#10;learned and wise men assembled together, and talked a great deal on&#10;every point; but the stork could make no sense out of anything they&#10;said; neither were there any good results from their consultations,&#10;either for the sick man, or for his daughter in the marshy heath.&#10;When we listen to what people say in this world, we shall hear a&#10;great deal; but it is an advantage to know what has been said and&#10;done before, when we listen to a conversation. The stork did, and&#10;we know at least as much as he, the stork.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Love is a life-giver. The highest love produces the&#10;highest life. Only through love can the sick man be cured.&#34; This&#10;had been said by many, and even the learned men acknowledged that&#10;it was a wise saying.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What a beautiful thought!&#34; exclaimed the papa stork&#10;immediately.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I don&#39;t quite understand it,&#34; said the mamma stork, when&#10;her husband repeated it; &#34;however, it is not my fault, but the&#10;fault of the thought; whatever it may be, I have something else to&#10;think of.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Now the learned men had spoken also of love between this&#10;one and that one; of the difference of the love which we have for&#10;our neighbor, to the love that exists between parents and children;&#10;of the love of the plant for the light, and how the germ springs&#10;forth when the sunbeam kisses the ground. All these things were so&#10;elaborately and learnedly explained, that it was impossible for&#10;stork-papa to follow it, much less to talk about it. His thoughts&#10;on the subject quite weighed him down; he stood the whole of the&#10;following day on one leg, with half-shut eyes, thinking deeply. So&#10;much learning was quite a heavy weight for him to carry. One thing,&#10;however, the papa stork could understand. Every one, high and low,&#10;had from their inmost hearts expressed their opinion that it was a&#10;great misfortune for so many thousands of people&#8212;the whole country&#10;indeed&#8212;to have this man so sick, with no hopes of his recovery. And&#10;what joy and blessing it would spread around if he could by any&#10;means be cured! But where bloomed the flower that could bring him&#10;health? They had searched for it everywhere; in learned writings,&#10;in the shining stars, in the weather and wind. Inquiries had been&#10;made in every by-way that could be thought of, until at last the&#10;wise and learned men has asserted, as we have been already told,&#10;that &#34;love, the life-giver, could alone give new life to a father;&#34;&#10;and in saying this, they had overdone it, and said more than they&#10;understood themselves. They repeated it, and wrote it down as a&#10;recipe, &#34;Love is a life-giver.&#34; But how could such a recipe be&#10;prepared&#8212;that was a difficulty they could not overcome. At last it&#10;was decided that help could only come from the princess herself,&#10;whose whole soul was wrapped up in her father, especially as a plan&#10;had been adopted by her to enable her to obtain a&#10;remedy.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;More than a year had passed since the princess had set out&#10;at night, when the light of the young moon was soon lost beneath&#10;the horizon. She had gone to the marble sphinx in the desert,&#10;shaking the sand from her sandals, and then passed through the long&#10;passage, which leads to the centre of one of the great pyramids,&#10;where the mighty kings of antiquity, surrounded with pomp and&#10;splendor, lie veiled in the form of mummies. She had been told by&#10;the wise men, that if she laid her head on the breast of one of&#10;them, from the head she would learn where to find life and recovery&#10;for her father. She had performed all this, and in a dream had&#10;learnt that she must bring home to her father the lotus flower,&#10;which grows in the deep sea, near the moors and heath in the Danish&#10;land. The very place and situation had been pointed out to her, and&#10;she was told that the flower would restore her father to health and&#10;strength. And, therefore, she had gone forth from the land of&#10;Egypt, flying over to the open marsh and the wild moor in the&#10;plumage of a swan.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The papa and mamma storks knew all this, and we also know&#10;it now. We know, too, that the Marsh King has drawn her down to&#10;himself, and that to the loved ones at home she is forever dead.&#10;One of the wisest of them said, as the stork-mamma also said, &#34;That&#10;in some way she would, after all, manage to succeed;&#34; and so at&#10;last they comforted themselves with this hope, and would wait&#10;patiently; in fact, they could do nothing better.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I should like to get away the swan&#39;s feathers from those&#10;two treacherous princesses,&#34; said the papa stork; &#34;then, at least,&#10;they would not be able to fly over again to the wild moor, and do&#10;more wickedness. I can hide the two suits of feathers over yonder,&#10;till we find some use for them.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But where will you put them?&#34; asked the mamma&#10;stork.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;In our nest on the moor. I and the young ones will carry&#10;them by turns during our flight across; and as we return, should&#10;they prove too heavy for us, we shall be sure to find plenty of&#10;places on the way in which we can conceal them till our next&#10;journey. Certainly one suit of swan&#39;s feathers would be enough for&#10;the princess, but two are always better. In those northern&#10;countries no one can have too many travelling wrappers.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No one will thank you for it,&#34; said stork-mamma; &#34;but you&#10;are master; and, excepting at breeding time, I have nothing to&#10;say.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the Viking&#39;s castle on the wild moor, to which the&#10;storks directed their flight in the following spring, the little&#10;maiden still remained. They had named her Helga, which was rather&#10;too soft a name for a child with a temper like hers, although her&#10;form was still beautiful. Every month this temper showed itself in&#10;sharper outlines; and in the course of years, while the storks&#10;still made the same journeys in autumn to the hill, and in spring&#10;to the moors, the child grew to be almost a woman, and before any&#10;one seemed aware of it, she was a wonderfully beautiful maiden of&#10;sixteen. The casket was splendid, but the contents were worthless.&#10;She was, indeed, wild and savage even in those hard, uncultivated&#10;times. It was a pleasure to her to splash about with her white&#10;hands in the warm blood of the horse which had been slain for&#10;sacrifice. In one of her wild moods she bit off the head of the&#10;black cock, which the priest was about to slay for the sacrifice.&#10;To her foster-father she said one day, &#34;If thine enemy were to pull&#10;down thine house about thy ears, and thou shouldest be sleeping in&#10;unconscious security, I would not wake thee; even if I had the&#10;power I would never do it, for my ears still tingle with the blow&#10;that thou gavest me years ago. I have never forgotten it.&#34; But the&#10;Viking treated her words as a joke; he was, like every one else,&#10;bewitched with her beauty, and knew nothing of the change in the&#10;form and temper of Helga at night. Without a saddle, she would sit&#10;on a horse as if she were a part of it, while it rushed along at&#10;full speed; nor would she spring from its back, even when it&#10;quarrelled with other horses and bit them. She would often leap&#10;from the high shore into the sea with all her clothes on, and swim&#10;to meet the Viking, when his boat was steering home towards the&#10;shore. She once cut off a long lock of her beautiful hair, and&#10;twisted it into a string for her bow. &#34;If a thing is to be done&#10;well,&#34; said she, &#34;I must do it myself.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Viking&#39;s wife was, for the time in which she lived, a&#10;woman of strong character and will; but, compared to her daughter,&#10;she was a gentle, timid woman, and she knew that a wicked sorcerer&#10;had the terrible child in his power. It was sometimes as if Helga&#10;acted from sheer wickedness; for often when her mother stood on the&#10;threshold of the door, or stepped into the yard, she would seat&#10;herself on the brink of the well, wave her arms and legs in the&#10;air, and suddenly fall right in. Here she was able, from her frog&#10;nature, to dip and dive about in the water of the deep well, until&#10;at last she would climb forth like a cat, and come back into the&#10;hall dripping with water, so that the green leaves that were&#10;strewed on the floor were whirled round, and carried away by the&#10;streams that flowed from her.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But there was one time of the day which placed a check&#10;upon Helga. It was the evening twilight; when this hour arrived she&#10;became quiet and thoughtful, and allowed herself to be advised and&#10;led; then also a secret feeling seemed to draw her towards her&#10;mother. And as usual, when the sun set, and the transformation took&#10;place, both in body and mind, inwards and outwards, she would&#10;remain quiet and mournful, with her form shrunk together in the&#10;shape of a frog. Her body was much larger than those animals ever&#10;are, and on this account it was much more hideous in appearance;&#10;for she looked like a wretched dwarf, with a frog&#39;s head, and&#10;webbed fingers. Her eyes had a most piteous expression; she was&#10;without a voice, excepting a hollow, croaking sound, like the&#10;smothered sobs of a dreaming child.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the Viking&#39;s wife took her on her lap, and forgot the&#10;ugly form, as she looked into the mournful eyes, and often said, &#34;I&#10;could wish that thou wouldst always remain my dumb frog child, for&#10;thou art too terrible when thou art clothed in a form of beauty.&#34;&#10;And the Viking woman wrote Runic characters against sorcery and&#10;spells of sickness, and threw them over the wretched child; but&#10;they did no good.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;One can scarcely believe that she was ever small enough&#10;to lie in the cup of the water-lily,&#34; said the papa stork; &#34;and now&#10;she is grown up, and the image of her Egyptian mother, especially&#10;about the eyes. Ah, we shall never see her again; perhaps she has&#10;not discovered how to help herself, as you and the wise men said&#10;she would. Year after year have I flown across and across the moor,&#10;but there was no sign of her being still alive. Yes, and I may as&#10;well tell you that you that each year, when I arrived a few days&#10;before you to repair the nest, and put everything in its place, I&#10;have spent a whole night flying here and there over the marshy&#10;lake, as if I had been an owl or a bat, but all to no purpose. The&#10;two suit of swan&#39;s plumage, which I and the young ones dragged over&#10;here from the land of the Nile, are of no use; trouble enough it&#10;was to us to bring them here in three journeys, and now they are&#10;lying at the bottom of the nest; and if a fire should happen to&#10;break out, and the wooden house be burnt down, they would be&#10;destroyed.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And our good nest would be destroyed, too,&#34; said the&#10;mamma stork; &#34;but you think less of that than of your plumage stuff&#10;and your moor-princess. Go and stay with her in the marsh if you&#10;like. You are a bad father to your own children, as I have told you&#10;already, when I hatched my first brood. I only hope neither we nor&#10;our children may have an arrow sent through our wings, owing to&#10;that wild girl. Helga does not know in the least what she is about.&#10;We have lived in this house longer than she has, she should think&#10;of that, and we have never forgotten our duty. We have paid every&#10;year our toll of a feather, an egg, and a young one, as it is only&#10;right we should do. You don&#39;t suppose I can wander about the&#10;court-yard, or go everywhere as I used to do in old times. I can do&#10;it in Egypt, where I can be a companion of the people, without&#10;forgetting myself. But here I cannot go and peep into the pots and&#10;kettles as I do there. No, I can only sit up here and feel angry&#10;with that girl, the little wretch; and I am angry with you, too;&#10;you should have left her lying in the water lily, then no one would&#10;have known anything about her.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You are far better than your conversation,&#34; said the papa&#10;stork; &#34;I know you better than you know yourself.&#34; And with that he&#10;gave a hop, and flapped his wings twice, proudly; then he stretched&#10;his neck and flew, or rather soared away, without moving his&#10;outspread wings. He went on for some distance, and then he gave a&#10;great flap with his wings and flew on his course at a rapid rate,&#10;his head and neck bending proudly before him, while the sun&#39;s rays&#10;fell on his glossy plumage.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;He is the handsomest of them all,&#34; said the mamma stork,&#10;as she watched him; &#34;but I won&#39;t tell him so.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Early in the autumn, the Viking again returned home laden&#10;with spoil, and bringing prisoners with him. Among them was a young&#10;Christian priest, one of those who contemned the gods of the north.&#10;Often lately there had been, both in hall and chamber, a talk of&#10;the new faith which was spreading far and wide in the south, and&#10;which, through the means of the holy Ansgarius, had already reached&#10;as far as Hedeby on the Schlei. Even Helga had heard of this belief&#10;in the teachings of One who was named Christ, and who for the love&#10;of mankind, and for their redemption, had given up His life. But to&#10;her all this had, as it were, gone in one ear and out the other. It&#10;seemed that she only understood the meaning of the word &#34;love,&#34;&#10;when in the form of a miserable frog she crouched together in the&#10;corner of the sleeping chamber; but the Viking&#39;s wife had listened&#10;to the wonderful story, and had felt herself strangely moved by&#10;it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;On their return, after this voyage, the men spoke of the&#10;beautiful temples built of polished stone, which had been raised&#10;for the public worship of this holy love. Some vessels, curiously&#10;formed of massive gold, had been brought home among the booty.&#10;There was a peculiar fragrance about them all, for they were&#10;incense vessels, which had been swung before the altars in the&#10;temples by the Christian priests. In the deep stony cellars of the&#10;castle, the young Christian priest was immured, and his hands and&#10;feet tied together with strips of bark. The Viking&#39;s wife&#10;considered him as beautiful as Baldur, and his distress raised her&#10;pity; but Helga said he ought to have ropes fastened to his heels,&#10;and be tied to the tails of wild animals.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I would let the dogs loose after him&#34; she said; &#34;over the&#10;moor and across the heath. Hurrah! that would be a spectacle for&#10;the gods, and better still to follow in its course.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But the Viking would not allow him to die such a death as&#10;that, especially as he was the disowned and despiser of the high&#10;gods. In a few days, he had decided to have him offered as a&#10;sacrifice on the blood-stone in the grove. For the first time, a&#10;man was to be sacrificed here. Helga begged to be allowed to&#10;sprinkle the assembled people with the blood of the priest. She&#10;sharpened her glittering knife; and when one of the great, savage&#10;dogs, who were running about the Viking&#39;s castle in great numbers,&#10;sprang towards her, she thrust the knife into his side, merely, as&#10;she said, to prove its sharpness.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Viking&#39;s wife looked at the wild, badly disposed girl,&#10;with great sorrow; and when night came on, and her daughter&#39;s&#10;beautiful form and disposition were changed, she spoke in eloquent&#10;words to Helga of the sorrow and deep grief that was in her heart.&#10;The ugly frog, in its monstrous shape, stood before her, and raised&#10;its brown mournful eyes to her face, listening to her words, and&#10;seeming to understand them with the intelligence of a human&#10;being.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Never once to my lord and husband has a word passed my&#10;lips of what I have to suffer through you; my heart is full of&#10;grief about you,&#34; said the Viking&#39;s wife. &#34;The love of a mother is&#10;greater and more powerful than I ever imagined. But love never&#10;entered thy heart; it is cold and clammy, like the plants on the&#10;moor.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the miserable form trembled; it was as if these words&#10;had touched an invisible bond between body and soul, for great&#10;tears stood in the eyes.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;A bitter time will come for thee at last,&#34; continued the&#10;Viking&#39;s wife; &#34;and it will be terrible for me too. It had been&#10;better for thee if thou hadst been left on the high-road, with the&#10;cold night wind to lull thee to sleep.&#34; And the Viking&#39;s wife shed&#10;bitter tears, and went away in anger and sorrow, passing under the&#10;partition of furs, which hung loose over the beam and divided the&#10;hall.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The shrivelled frog still sat in the corner alone. Deep&#10;silence reigned around. At intervals, a half-stifled sigh was heard&#10;from its inmost soul; it was the soul of Helga. It seemed in pain,&#10;as if a new life were arising in her heart. Then she took a step&#10;forward and listened; then stepped again forward, and seized with&#10;her clumsy hands the heavy bar which was laid across the door.&#10;Gently, and with much trouble, she pushed back the bar, as silently&#10;lifted the latch, and then took up the glimmering lamp which stood&#10;in the ante-chamber of the hall. It seemed as if a stronger will&#10;than her own gave her strength. She removed the iron bolt from the&#10;closed cellar-door, and slipped in to the prisoner. He was&#10;slumbering. She touched him with her cold, moist hand, and as he&#10;awoke and caught sight of the hideous form, he shuddered as if he&#10;beheld a wicked apparition. She drew her knife, cut through the&#10;bonds which confined his hands and feet, and beckoned to him to&#10;follow her. He uttered some holy names and made the sign of the&#10;cross, while the form remained motionless by his side.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Who art thou?&#34; he asked, &#34;whose outward appearance is&#10;that of an animal, while thou willingly performest acts of&#10;mercy?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The frog-figure beckoned to him to follow her, and led him&#10;through a long gallery concealed by hanging drapery to the stables,&#10;and then pointed to a horse. He mounted upon it, and she sprang up&#10;also before him, and held tightly by the animal&#39;s mane. The&#10;prisoner understood her, and they rode on at a rapid trot, by a&#10;road which he would never have found by himself, across the open&#10;heath. He forgot her ugly form, and only thought how the mercy and&#10;loving-kindness of the Almighty was acting through this hideous&#10;apparition. As he offered pious prayers and sang holy songs of&#10;praise, she trembled. Was it the effect of prayer and praise that&#10;caused this? or, was she shuddering in the cold morning air at the&#10;thought of approaching twilight? What were her feelings? She raised&#10;herself up, and wanted to stop the horse and spring off, but the&#10;Christian priest held her back with all his might, and then sang a&#10;pious song, as if this could loosen the wicked charm that had&#10;changed her into the semblance of a frog.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the horse galloped on more wildly than before. The sky&#10;painted itself red, the first sunbeam pierced through the clouds,&#10;and in the clear flood of sunlight the frog became changed. It was&#10;Helga again, young and beautiful, but with a wicked demoniac&#10;spirit. He held now a beautiful young woman in his arms, and he was&#10;horrified at the sight. He stopped the horse, and sprang from its&#10;back. He imagined that some new sorcery was at work. But Helga also&#10;leaped from the horse and stood on the ground. The child&#39;s short&#10;garment reached only to her knee. She snatched the sharp knife from&#10;her girdle, and rushed like lightning at the astonished priest.&#10;&#34;Let me get at thee!&#34; she cried; &#34;let me get at thee, that I may&#10;plunge this knife into thy body. Thou art pale as ashes, thou&#10;beardless slave.&#34; She pressed in upon him. They struggled with each&#10;other in heavy combat, but it was as if an invisible power had been&#10;given to the Christian in the struggle. He held her fast, and the&#10;old oak under which they stood seemed to help him, for the loosened&#10;roots on the ground became entangled in the maiden&#39;s feet, and held&#10;them fast. Close by rose a bubbling spring, and he sprinkled&#10;Helga&#39;s face and neck with the water, commanded the unclean spirit&#10;to come forth, and pronounced upon her a Christian blessing. But&#10;the water of faith has no power unless the well-spring of faith&#10;flows within. And yet even here its power was shown; something more&#10;than the mere strength of a man opposed itself, through his means,&#10;against the evil which struggled within her. His holy action seemed&#10;to overpower her. She dropped her arms, glanced at him with pale&#10;cheeks and looks of amazement. He appeared to her a mighty magician&#10;skilled in secret arts; his language was the darkest magic to her,&#10;and the movements of his hands in the air were as the secret signs&#10;of a magician&#39;s wand. She would not have blinked had he waved over&#10;her head a sharp knife or a glittering axe; but she shrunk from him&#10;as he signed her with the sign of the cross on her forehead and&#10;breast, and sat before him like a tame bird, with her head bowed&#10;down. Then he spoke to her, in gentle words, of the deed of love&#10;she had performed for him during the night, when she had come to&#10;him in the form of an ugly frog, to loosen his bonds, and to lead&#10;him forth to life and light; and he told her that she was bound in&#10;closer fetters than he had been, and that she could recover also&#10;life and light by his means. He would take her to Hedeby to St.&#10;Ansgarius, and there, in that Christian town, the spell of the&#10;sorcerer would be removed. But he would not let her sit before him&#10;on the horse, though of her own free will she wished to do so.&#10;&#34;Thou must sit behind me, not before me,&#34; said he. &#34;Thy magic&#10;beauty has a magic power which comes from an evil origin, and I&#10;fear it; still I am sure to overcome through my faith in Christ.&#34;&#10;Then he knelt down, and prayed with pious fervor. It was as if the&#10;quiet woodland were a holy church consecrated by his worship. The&#10;birds sang as if they were also of this new congregation; and the&#10;fragrance of the wild flowers was as the ambrosial perfume of&#10;incense; while, above all, sounded the words of Scripture, &#34;A light&#10;to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide&#10;their feet into the way of peace.&#34; And he spoke these words with&#10;the deep longing of his whole nature.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Meanwhile, the horse that had carried them in wild career&#10;stood quietly by, plucking at the tall bramble-bushes, till the&#10;ripe young berries fell down upon Helga&#39;s hands, as if inviting her&#10;to eat. Patiently she allowed herself to be lifted on the horse,&#10;and sat there like a somnambulist&#8212;as one who walked in his sleep.&#10;The Christian bound two branches together with bark, in the form of&#10;a cross, and held it on high as they rode through the forest. The&#10;way gradually grew thicker of brushwood, as they rode along, till&#10;at last it became a trackless wilderness. Bushes of the wild sloe&#10;here and there blocked up the path, so that they had to ride over&#10;them. The bubbling spring formed not a stream, but a marsh, round&#10;which also they were obliged to guide the horse; still there were&#10;strength and refreshment in the cool forest breeze, and no trifling&#10;power in the gentle words spoken in faith and Christian love by the&#10;young priest, whose inmost heart yearned to lead this poor lost one&#10;into the way of light and life. It is said that rain-drops can make&#10;a hollow in the hardest stone, and the waves of the sea can smooth&#10;and round the rough edges of the rocks; so did the dew of mercy&#10;fall upon Helga, softening what was hard, and smoothing what was&#10;rough in her character. These effects did not yet appear; she was&#10;not herself aware of them; neither does the seed in the lap of&#10;earth know, when the refreshing dew and the warm sunbeams fall upon&#10;it, that it contains within itself power by which it will flourish&#10;and bloom. The song of the mother sinks into the heart of the&#10;child, and the little one prattles the words after her, without&#10;understanding their meaning; but after a time the thoughts expand,&#10;and what has been heard in childhood seems to the mind clear and&#10;bright. So now the &#34;Word,&#34; which is all-powerful to create, was&#10;working in the heart of Helga.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;They rode forth from the thick forest, crossed the heath,&#10;and again entered a pathless wood. Here, towards evening, they met&#10;with robbers.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Where hast thou stolen that beauteous maiden?&#34; cried the&#10;robbers, seizing the horse by the bridle, and dragging the two&#10;riders from its back.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The priest had nothing to defend himself with, but the&#10;knife he had taken from Helga, and with this he struck out right&#10;and left. One of the robbers raised his axe against him; but the&#10;young priest sprang on one side, and avoided the blow, which fell&#10;with great force on the horse&#39;s neck, so that the blood gushed&#10;forth, and the animal sunk to the ground. Then Helga seemed&#10;suddenly to awake from her long, deep reverie; she threw herself&#10;hastily upon the dying animal. The priest placed himself before&#10;her, to defend and shelter her; but one of the robbers swung his&#10;iron axe against the Christian&#39;s head with such force that it was&#10;dashed to pieces, the blood and brains were scattered about, and he&#10;fell dead upon the ground. Then the robbers seized beautiful Helga&#10;by her white arms and slender waist; but at that moment the sun&#10;went down, and as its last ray disappeared, she was changed into&#10;the form of a frog. A greenish white mouth spread half over her&#10;face; her arms became thin and slimy; while broad hands, with&#10;webbed fingers, spread themselves out like fans. Then the robbers,&#10;in terror, let her go, and she stood among them, a hideous monster;&#10;and as is the nature of frogs to do, she hopped up as high as her&#10;own size, and disappeared in the thicket. Then the robbers knew&#10;that this must be the work of an evil spirit or some secret&#10;sorcery, and, in a terrible fright, they ran hastily from the&#10;spot.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The full moon had already risen, and was shining in all&#10;her radiant splendor over the earth, when from the thicket, in the&#10;form of a frog, crept poor Helga. She stood still by the corpse of&#10;the Christian priest, and the carcase of the dead horse. She looked&#10;at them with eyes that seemed to weep, and from the frog&#39;s head&#10;came forth a croaking sound, as when a child bursts into tears. She&#10;threw herself first upon one, and then upon the other; brought&#10;water in her hand, which, from being webbed, was large and hollow,&#10;and poured it over them; but they were dead, and dead they would&#10;remain. She understood that at last. Soon wild animals would come&#10;and tear their dead bodies; but no, that must not happen. Then she&#10;dug up the earth, as deep as she was able, that she might prepare a&#10;grave for them. She had nothing but a branch of a tree and her two&#10;hands, between the fingers of which the webbed skin stretched, and&#10;they were torn by the work, while the blood ran down her hands. She&#10;saw at last that her work would be useless, more than she could&#10;accomplish; so she fetched more water, and washed the face of the&#10;dead, and then covered it with fresh green leaves; she also brought&#10;large boughs and spread over him, and scattered dried leaves&#10;between the branches. Then she brought the heaviest stones that she&#10;could carry, and laid them over the dead body, filling up the&#10;crevices with moss, till she thought she had fenced in his&#10;resting-place strongly enough. The difficult task had employed her&#10;the whole night; and as the sun broke forth, there stood the&#10;beautiful Helga in all her loveliness, with her bleeding hands,&#10;and, for the first time, with tears on her maiden cheeks. It was,&#10;in this transformation, as if two natures were striving together&#10;within her; her whole frame trembled, and she looked around her as&#10;if she had just awoke from a painful dream. She leaned for support&#10;against the trunk of a slender tree, and at last climbed to the&#10;topmost branches, like a cat, and seated herself firmly upon them.&#10;She remained there the whole day, sitting alone, like a frightened&#10;squirrel, in the silent solitude of the wood, where the rest and&#10;stillness is as the calm of death.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Butterflies fluttered around her, and close by were&#10;several ant-hills, each with its hundreds of busy little creatures&#10;moving quickly to and fro. In the air, danced myriads of gnats,&#10;swarm upon swarm, troops of buzzing flies, ladybirds, dragon-flies&#10;with golden wings, and other little winged creatures. The worm&#10;crawled forth from the moist ground, and the moles crept out; but,&#10;excepting these, all around had the stillness of death: but when&#10;people say this, they do not quite understand themselves what they&#10;mean. None noticed Helga but a flock of magpies, which flew&#10;chattering round the top of the tree on which she sat. These birds&#10;hopped close to her on the branches with bold curiosity. A glance&#10;from her eyes was a signal to frighten them away, and they were not&#10;clever enough to find out who she was; indeed she hardly knew&#10;herself.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;When the sun was near setting, and the evening&#39;s twilight&#10;about to commence, the approaching transformation aroused her to&#10;fresh exertion. She let herself down gently from the tree, and, as&#10;the last sunbeam vanished, she stood again in the wrinkled form of&#10;a frog, with the torn, webbed skin on her hands, but her eyes now&#10;gleamed with more radiant beauty than they had ever possessed in&#10;her most beautiful form of loveliness; they were now pure, mild&#10;maidenly eyes that shone forth in the face of a frog. They showed&#10;the existence of deep feeling and a human heart, and the beauteous&#10;eyes overflowed with tears, weeping precious drops that lightened&#10;the heart.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;On the raised mound which she had made as a grave for the&#10;dead priest, she found the cross made of the branches of a tree,&#10;the last work of him who now lay dead and cold beneath it. A sudden&#10;thought came to Helga, and she lifted up the cross and planted it&#10;upon the grave, between the stones that covered him and the dead&#10;horse. The sad recollection brought the tears to her eyes, and in&#10;this gentle spirit she traced the same sign in the sand round the&#10;grave; and as she formed, with both her hands, the sign of the&#10;cross, the web skin fell from them like a torn glove. She washed&#10;her hands in the water of the spring, and gazed with astonishment&#10;at their delicate whiteness. Again she made the holy sign in the&#10;air, between herself and the dead man; her lips trembled, her&#10;tongue moved, and the name which she in her ride through the forest&#10;had so often heard spoken, rose to her lips, and she uttered the&#10;words, &#34;Jesus Christ.&#34; Then the frog skin fell from her; she was&#10;once more a lovely maiden. Her head bent wearily, her tired limbs&#10;required rest, and then she slept.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Her sleep, however, was short. Towards midnight, she&#10;awoke; before her stood the dead horse, prancing and full of life,&#10;which shone forth from his eyes and from his wounded neck. Close by&#10;his side appeared the murdered Christian priest, more beautiful&#10;than Baldur, as the Viking&#39;s wife had said; but now he came as if&#10;in a flame of fire. Such gravity, such stern justice, such a&#10;piercing glance shone from his large, gentle eyes, that it seemed&#10;to penetrate into every corner of her heart. Beautiful Helga&#10;trembled at the look, and her memory returned with a power as if it&#10;had been the day of judgment. Every good deed that had been done&#10;for her, every loving word that had been said, were vividly before&#10;her mind. She understood now that love had kept her here during the&#10;day of her trial; while the creature formed of dust and clay, soul&#10;and spirit, had wrestled and struggled with evil. She acknowledged&#10;that she had only followed the impulses of an evil disposition,&#10;that she had done nothing to cure herself; everything had been&#10;given her, and all had happened as it were by the ordination of&#10;Providence. She bowed herself humbly, confessed her great&#10;imperfections in the sight of Him who can read every fault of the&#10;heart, and then the priest spoke. &#34;Daughter of the moorland, thou&#10;hast come from the swamp and the marshy earth, but from this thou&#10;shalt arise. The sunlight shining into thy inmost soul proves the&#10;origin from which thou hast really sprung, and has restored the&#10;body to its natural form. I am come to thee from the land of the&#10;dead, and thou also must pass through the valley to reach the holy&#10;mountains where mercy and perfection dwell. I cannot lead thee to&#10;Hedeby that thou mayst receive Christian baptism, for first thou&#10;must remove the thick veil with which the waters of the moorland&#10;are shrouded, and bring forth from its depths the living author of&#10;thy being and thy life. Till this is done, thou canst not receive&#10;consecration.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then he lifted her on the horse and gave her a golden&#10;censer, similar to those she had already seen at the Viking&#39;s&#10;house. A sweet perfume arose from it, while the open wound in the&#10;forehead of the slain priest, shone with the rays of a diamond. He&#10;took the cross from the grave, and held it aloft, and now they rode&#10;through the air over the rustling trees, over the hills where&#10;warriors lay buried each by his dead war-horse; and the brazen&#10;monumental figures rose up and galloped forth, and stationed&#10;themselves on the summits of the hills. The golden crescent on&#10;their foreheads, fastened with golden knots, glittered in the&#10;moonlight, and their mantles floated in the wind. The dragon, that&#10;guards buried treasure, lifted his head and gazed after them. The&#10;goblins and the satyrs peeped out from beneath the hills, and&#10;flitted to and fro in the fields, waving blue, red, and green&#10;torches, like the glowing sparks in burning paper. Over woodland&#10;and heath, flood and fen, they flew on, till they reached the wild&#10;moor, over which they hovered in broad circles. The Christian&#10;priest held the cross aloft, and it glittered like gold, while from&#10;his lips sounded pious prayers. Beautiful Helga&#39;s voice joined with&#10;his in the hymns he sung, as a child joins in her mother&#39;s song.&#10;She swung the censer, and a wonderful fragrance of incense arose&#10;from it; so powerful, that the reeds and rushes of the moor burst&#10;forth into blossom. Each germ came forth from the deep ground: all&#10;that had life raised itself. Blooming water-lilies spread&#10;themselves forth like a carpet of wrought flowers, and upon them&#10;lay a slumbering woman, young and beautiful. Helga fancied that it&#10;was her own image she saw reflected in the still water. But it was&#10;her mother she beheld, the wife of the Marsh King, the princess&#10;from the land of the Nile.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The dead Christian priest desired that the sleeping woman&#10;should be lifted on the horse, but the horse sank beneath the load,&#10;as if he had been a funeral pall fluttering in the wind. But the&#10;sign of the cross made the airy phantom strong, and then the three&#10;rode away from the marsh to firm ground.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;At the same moment the cock crew in the Viking&#39;s castle,&#10;and the dream figures dissolved and floated away in the air, but&#10;mother and daughter stood opposite to each other.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Am I looking at my own image in the deep water?&#34; said the&#10;mother.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Is it myself that I see represented on a white shield?&#34;&#10;cried the daughter.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then they came nearer to each other in a fond embrace. The&#10;mother&#39;s heart beat quickly, and she understood the quickened&#10;pulses. &#34;My child!&#34; she exclaimed, &#34;the flower of my heart&#8212;my lotus&#10;flower of the deep water!&#34; and she embraced her child again and&#10;wept, and the tears were as a baptism of new life and love for&#10;Helga. &#34;In swan&#39;s plumage I came here,&#34; said the mother, &#34;and here&#10;I threw off my feather dress. Then I sank down through the wavering&#10;ground, deep into the marsh beneath, which closed like a wall&#10;around me; I found myself after a while in fresher water; still a&#10;power drew me down deeper and deeper. I felt the weight of sleep&#10;upon my eyelids. Then I slept, and dreams hovered round me. It&#10;seemed to me as if I were again in the pyramids of Egypt, and yet&#10;the waving elder trunk that had frightened me on the moor stood&#10;ever before me. I observed the clefts and wrinkles in the stem;&#10;they shone forth in strange colors, and took the form of&#10;hieroglyphics. It was the mummy case on which I gazed. At last it&#10;burst, and forth stepped the thousand years&#39; old king, the mummy&#10;form, black as pitch, black as the shining wood-snail, or the slimy&#10;mud of the swamp. Whether it was really the mummy or the Marsh King&#10;I know not. He seized me in his arms, and I felt as if I must die.&#10;When I recovered myself, I found in my bosom a little bird,&#10;flapping its wings, twittering and fluttering. The bird flew away&#10;from my bosom, upwards towards the dark, heavy canopy above me, but&#10;a long, green band kept it fastened to me. I heard and understood&#10;the tenor of its longings. Freedom! sunlight! to my father! Then I&#10;thought of my father, and the sunny land of my birth, my life, and&#10;my love. Then I loosened the band, and let the bird fly away to its&#10;home&#8212;to a father. Since that hour I have ceased to dream; my sleep&#10;has been long and heavy, till in this very hour, harmony and&#10;fragrance awoke me, and set me free.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The green band which fastened the wings of the bird to the&#10;mother&#39;s heart, where did it flutter now? whither had it been&#10;wafted? The stork only had seen it. The band was the green stalk,&#10;the cup of the flower the cradle in which lay the child, that now&#10;in blooming beauty had been folded to the mother&#39;s&#10;heart.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And while the two were resting in each other&#39;s arms, the&#10;old stork flew round and round them in narrowing circles, till at&#10;length he flew away swiftly to his nest, and fetched away the two&#10;suits of swan&#39;s feathers, which he had preserved there for many&#10;years. Then he returned to the mother and daughter, and threw the&#10;swan&#39;s plumage over them; the feathers immediately closed around&#10;them, and they rose up from the earth in the form of two white&#10;swans.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And now we can converse with pleasure,&#34; said the&#10;stork-papa; &#34;we can understand one another, although the beaks of&#10;birds are so different in shape. It is very fortunate that you came&#10;to-night. To-morrow we should have been gone. The mother, myself&#10;and the little ones, we&#39;re about to fly to the south. Look at me&#10;now: I am an old friend from the Nile, and a mother&#39;s heart&#10;contains more than her beak. She always said that the princess&#10;would know how to help herself. I and the young ones carried the&#10;swan&#39;s feathers over here, and I am glad of it now, and how lucky&#10;it is that I am here still. When the day dawns we shall start with&#10;a great company of other storks. We&#39;ll fly first, and you can&#10;follow in our track, so that you cannot miss your way. I and the&#10;young ones will have an eye upon you.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And the lotus-flower which I was to take with me,&#34; said&#10;the Egyptian princess, &#34;is flying here by my side, clothed in&#10;swan&#39;s feathers. The flower of my heart will travel with me; and so&#10;the riddle is solved. Now for home! now for home!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But Helga said she could not leave the Danish land without&#10;once more seeing her foster-mother, the loving wife of the Viking.&#10;Each pleasing recollection, each kind word, every tear from the&#10;heart which her foster-mother had wept for her, rose in her mind,&#10;and at that moment she felt as if she loved this mother the&#10;best.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, we must go to the Viking&#39;s castle,&#34; said the stork;&#10;&#34;mother and the young ones are waiting for me there. How they will&#10;open their eyes and flap their wings! My wife, you see, does not&#10;say much; she is short and abrupt in her manner; but she means&#10;well, for all that. I will flap my wings at once, that they may&#10;hear us coming.&#34; Then stork-papa flapped his wings in first-rate&#10;style, and he and the swans flew away to the Viking&#39;s&#10;castle.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the castle, every one was in a deep sleep. It had been&#10;late in the evening before the Viking&#39;s wife retired to rest. She&#10;was anxious about Helga, who, three days before, had vanished with&#10;the Christian priest. Helga must have helped him in his flight, for&#10;it was her horse that was missed from the stable; but by what power&#10;had all this been accomplished? The Viking&#39;s wife thought of it&#10;with wonder, thought on the miracles which they said could be&#10;performed by those who believed in the Christian faith, and&#10;followed its teachings. These passing thoughts formed themselves&#10;into a vivid dream, and it seemed to her that she was still lying&#10;awake on her couch, while without darkness reigned. A storm arose;&#10;she heard the lake dashing and rolling from east and west, like the&#10;waves of the North Sea or the Cattegat. The monstrous snake which,&#10;it is said, surrounds the earth in the depths of the ocean, was&#10;trembling in spasmodic convulsions. The night of the fall of the&#10;gods was come, &#34;Ragnorock,&#34; as the heathens call the judgment-day,&#10;when everything shall pass away, even the high gods themselves. The&#10;war trumpet sounded; riding upon the rainbow, came the gods, clad&#10;in steel, to fight their last battle on the last battle-field.&#10;Before them flew the winged vampires, and the dead warriors closed&#10;up the train. The whole firmament was ablaze with the northern&#10;lights, and yet the darkness triumphed. It was a terrible hour.&#10;And, close to the terrified woman, Helga seemed to be seated on the&#10;floor, in the hideous form of a frog, yet trembling, and clinging&#10;to her foster-mother, who took her on her lap, and lovingly&#10;caressed her, hideous and frog-like as she was. The air was filled&#10;with the clashing of arms and the hissing of arrows, as if a storm&#10;of hail was descending upon the earth. It seemed to her the hour&#10;when earth and sky would burst asunder, and all things be swallowed&#10;up in Saturn&#39;s fiery lake; but she knew that a new heaven and a new&#10;earth would arise, and that corn-fields would wave where now the&#10;lake rolled over desolate sands, and the ineffable God reign. Then&#10;she saw rising from the region of the dead, Baldur the gentle, the&#10;loving, and as the Viking&#39;s wife gazed upon him, she recognized his&#10;countenance. It was the captive Christian priest. &#34;White&#10;Christian!&#34; she exclaimed aloud, and with the words, she pressed a&#10;kiss on the forehead of the hideous frog-child. Then the frog-skin&#10;fell off, and Helga stood before her in all her beauty, more lovely&#10;and gentle-looking, and with eyes beaming with love. She kissed the&#10;hands of her foster-mother, blessed her for all her fostering love&#10;and care during the days of her trial and misery, for the thoughts&#10;she had suggested and awoke in her heart, and for naming the Name&#10;which she now repeated. Then beautiful Helga rose as a mighty swan,&#10;and spread her wings with the rushing sound of troops of birds of&#10;passage flying through the air.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the Viking&#39;s wife awoke, but she still heard the&#10;rushing sound without. She knew it was the time for the storks to&#10;depart, and that it must be their wings which she heard. She felt&#10;she should like to see them once more, and bid them farewell. She&#10;rose from her couch, stepped out on the threshold, and beheld, on&#10;the ridge of the roof, a party of storks ranged side by side.&#10;Troops of the birds were flying in circles over the castle and the&#10;highest trees; but just before her, as she stood on the threshold&#10;and close to the well where Helga had so often sat and alarmed her&#10;with her wildness, now stood two swans, gazing at her with&#10;intelligent eyes. Then she remembered her dream, which still&#10;appeared to her as a reality. She thought of Helga in the form of a&#10;swan. She thought of a Christian priest, and suddenly a wonderful&#10;joy arose in her heart. The swans flapped their wings and arched&#10;their necks as if to offer her a greeting, and the Viking&#39;s wife&#10;spread out her arms towards them, as if she accepted it, and smiled&#10;through her tears. She was roused from deep thought by a rustling&#10;of wings and snapping of beaks; all the storks arose, and started&#10;on their journey towards the south.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;We will not wait for the swans,&#34; said the mamma stork;&#10;&#34;if they want to go with us, let them come now; we can&#39;t sit here&#10;till the plovers start. It is a fine thing after all to travel in&#10;families, not like the finches and the partridges. There the male&#10;and the female birds fly in separate flocks, which, to speak&#10;candidly, I consider very unbecoming.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What are those swans flapping their wings&#10;for?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Well, every one flies in his own fashion,&#34; said the papa&#10;stork. &#34;The swans fly in an oblique line; the cranes, in the form&#10;of a triangle; and the plovers, in a curved line like a&#10;snake.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Don&#39;t talk about snakes while we are flying up here,&#34;&#10;said stork-mamma. &#34;It puts ideas into the children&#39;s heads that can&#10;not be realized.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Are those the high mountains I have heard spoken of?&#34;&#10;asked Helga, in the swan&#39;s plumage.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;They are storm-clouds driving along beneath us,&#34; replied&#10;her mother.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What are yonder white clouds that rise so high?&#34; again&#10;inquired Helga.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Those are mountains covered with perpetual snows, that&#10;you see yonder,&#34; said her mother. And then they flew across the&#10;Alps towards the blue Mediterranean.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Africa&#39;s land! Egyptia&#39;s strand!&#34; sang the daughter of&#10;the Nile, in her swan&#39;s plumage, as from the upper air she caught&#10;sight of her native land, a narrow, golden, wavy strip on the&#10;shores of the Nile; the other birds espied it also and hastened&#10;their flight.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I can smell the Nile mud and the wet frogs,&#34; said the&#10;stork-mamma, &#34;and I begin to feel quite hungry. Yes, now you shall&#10;taste something nice, and you will see the marabout bird, and the&#10;ibis, and the crane. They all belong to our family, but they are&#10;not nearly so handsome as we are. They give themselves great airs,&#10;especially the ibis. The Egyptians have spoilt him. They make a&#10;mummy of him, and stuff him with spices. I would rather be stuffed&#10;with live frogs, and so would you, and so you shall. Better have&#10;something in your inside while you are alive, than to be made a&#10;parade of after you are dead. That is my opinion, and I am always&#10;right.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The storks are come,&#34; was said in the great house on the&#10;banks of the Nile, where the lord lay in the hall on his downy&#10;cushions, covered with a leopard skin, scarcely alive, yet not&#10;dead, waiting and hoping for the lotus-flower from the deep&#10;moorland in the far north. Relatives and servants were standing by&#10;his couch, when the two beautiful swans who had come with the&#10;storks flew into the hall. They threw off their soft white plumage,&#10;and two lovely female forms approached the pale, sick old man, and&#10;threw back their long hair, and when Helga bent over her&#10;grandfather, redness came back to his cheeks, his eyes brightened,&#10;and life returned to his benumbed limbs. The old man rose up with&#10;health and energy renewed; daughter and grandchild welcomed him as&#10;joyfully as if with a morning greeting after a long and troubled&#10;dream.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Joy reigned through the whole house, as well as in the&#10;stork&#39;s nest; although there the chief cause was really the good&#10;food, especially the quantities of frogs, which seemed to spring&#10;out of the ground in swarms.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the learned men hastened to note down, in flying&#10;characters, the story of the two princesses, and spoke of the&#10;arrival of the health-giving flower as a mighty event, which had&#10;been a blessing to the house and the land. Meanwhile, the&#10;stork-papa told the story to his family in his own way; but not&#10;till they had eaten and were satisfied; otherwise they would have&#10;had something else to do than to listen to stories.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Well,&#34; said the stork-mamma, when she had heard it, &#34;you&#10;will be made something of at last; I suppose they can do nothing&#10;less.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What could I be made?&#34; said stork-papa; &#34;what have I&#10;done?&#8212;just nothing.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You have done more than all the rest,&#34; she replied. &#34;But&#10;for you and the youngsters the two young princesses would never&#10;have seen Egypt again, and the recovery of the old man would not&#10;have been effected. You will become something. They must certainly&#10;give you a doctor&#39;s hood, and our young ones will inherit it, and&#10;their children after them, and so on. You already look like an&#10;Egyptian doctor, at least in my eyes.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I cannot quite remember the words I heard when I listened&#10;on the roof,&#34; said stork-papa, while relating the story to his&#10;family; &#34;all I know is, that what the wise men said was so&#10;complicated and so learned, that they received not only rank, but&#10;presents; even the head cook at the great house was honored with a&#10;mark of distinction, most likely for the soup.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And what did you receive?&#34; said the stork-mamma. &#34;They&#10;certainly ought not to forget the most important person in the&#10;affair, as you really are. The learned men have done nothing at all&#10;but use their tongues. Surely they will not overlook&#10;you.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Late in the night, while the gentle sleep of peace rested&#10;on the now happy house, there was still one watcher. It was not&#10;stork-papa, who, although he stood on guard on one leg, could sleep&#10;soundly. Helga alone was awake. She leaned over the balcony, gazing&#10;at the sparkling stars that shone clearer and brighter in the pure&#10;air than they had done in the north, and yet they were the same&#10;stars. She thought of the Viking&#39;s wife in the wild moorland, of&#10;the gentle eyes of her foster-mother, and of the tears she had shed&#10;over the poor frog-child that now lived in splendor and starry&#10;beauty by the waters of the Nile, with air balmy and sweet as&#10;spring. She thought of the love that dwelt in the breast of the&#10;heathen woman, love that had been shown to a wretched creature,&#10;hateful as a human being, and hideous when in the form of an&#10;animal. She looked at the glittering stars, and thought of the&#10;radiance that had shone forth on the forehead of the dead man, as&#10;she had fled with him over the woodland and moor. Tones were&#10;awakened in her memory; words which she had heard him speak as they&#10;rode onward, when she was carried, wondering and trembling, through&#10;the air; words from the great Fountain of love, the highest love&#10;that embraces all the human race. What had not been won and&#10;achieved by this love?&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Day and night beautiful Helga was absorbed in the&#10;contemplation of the great amount of her happiness, and lost&#10;herself in the contemplation, like a child who turns hurriedly from&#10;the giver to examine the beautiful gifts. She was over-powered with&#10;her good fortune, which seemed always increasing, and therefore&#10;what might it become in the future? Had she not been brought by a&#10;wonderful miracle to all this joy and happiness? And in these&#10;thoughts she indulged, until at last she thought no more of the&#10;Giver. It was the over-abundance of youthful spirits unfolding its&#10;wings for a daring flight. Her eyes sparkled with energy, when&#10;suddenly arose a loud noise in the court below, and the daring&#10;thought vanished. She looked down, and saw two large ostriches&#10;running round quickly in narrow circles; she had never seen these&#10;creatures before,&#8212;great, coarse, clumsy-looking birds with curious&#10;wings that looked as if they had been clipped, and the birds&#10;themselves had the appearance of having been roughly used. She&#10;inquired about them, and for the first time heard the legend which&#10;the Egyptians relate respecting the ostrich.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Once, say they, the ostriches were a beautiful and&#10;glorious race of birds, with large, strong wings. One evening the&#10;other large birds of the forest said to the ostrich, &#34;Brother,&#10;shall we fly to the river to-morrow morning to drink, God willing?&#34;&#10;and the ostrich answered, &#34;I will.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;With the break of day, therefore, they commenced their&#10;flight; first rising high in the air, towards the sun, which is the&#10;eye of God; still higher and higher the ostrich flew, far above the&#10;other birds, proudly approaching the light, trusting in its own&#10;strength, and thinking not of the Giver, or saying, &#34;if God will.&#34;&#10;When suddenly the avenging angel drew back the veil from the&#10;flaming ocean of sunlight, and in a moment the wings of the proud&#10;bird were scorched and shrivelled, and they sunk miserably to the&#10;earth. Since that time the ostrich and his race have never been&#10;able to rise in the air; they can only fly terror-stricken along&#10;the ground, or run round and round in narrow circles. It is a&#10;warning to mankind, that in all our thoughts and schemes, and in&#10;every action we undertake, we should say, &#34;if God will.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then Helga bowed her head thoughtfully and seriously, and&#10;looked at the circling ostrich, as with timid fear and simple&#10;pleasure it glanced at its own great shadow on the sunlit walls.&#10;And the story of the ostrich sunk deeply into the heart and mind of&#10;Helga: a life of happiness, both in the present and in the future,&#10;seemed secure for her, and what was yet to come might be the best&#10;of all, God willing.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Early in the spring, when the storks were again about to&#10;journey northward, beautiful Helga took off her golden bracelets,&#10;scratched her name on them, and beckoned to the stork-father. He&#10;came to her, and she placed the golden circlet round his neck, and&#10;begged him to deliver it safely to the Viking&#39;s wife, so that she&#10;might know that her foster-daughter still lived, was happy, and had&#10;not forgotten her.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It is rather heavy to carry,&#34; thought stork-papa, when he&#10;had it on his neck; &#34;but gold and honor are not to be flung into&#10;the street. The stork brings good fortune&#8212;they&#39;ll be obliged to&#10;acknowledge that at last.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You lay gold, and I lay eggs,&#34; said stork-mamma; &#34;with&#10;you it is only once in a way, I lay eggs every year But no one&#10;appreciates what we do; I call it very mortifying.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But then we have a consciousness of our own worth,&#10;mother,&#34; replied stork-papa.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What good will that do you?&#34; retorted stork-mamma; &#34;it&#10;will neither bring you a fair wind, nor a good meal.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The little nightingale, who is singing yonder in the&#10;tamarind grove, will soon be going north, too.&#34; Helga said she had&#10;often heard her singing on the wild moor, so she determined to send&#10;a message by her. While flying in the swan&#39;s plumage she had learnt&#10;the bird language; she had often conversed with the stork and the&#10;swallow, and she knew that the nightingale would understand. So she&#10;begged the nightingale to fly to the beechwood, on the peninsula of&#10;Jutland, where a mound of stone and twigs had been raised to form&#10;the grave, and she begged the nightingale to persuade all the other&#10;little birds to build their nests round the place, so that evermore&#10;should resound over that grave music and song. And the nightingale&#10;flew away, and time flew away also.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the autumn, an eagle, standing upon a pyramid, saw a&#10;stately train of richly laden camels, and men attired in armor on&#10;foaming Arabian steeds, whose glossy skins shone like silver, their&#10;nostrils were pink, and their thick, flowing manes hung almost to&#10;their slender legs. A royal prince of Arabia, handsome as a prince&#10;should be, and accompanied by distinguished guests, was on his way&#10;to the stately house, on the roof of which the storks&#39; empty nests&#10;might be seen. They were away now in the far north, but expected to&#10;return very soon. And, indeed, they returned on a day that was rich&#10;in joy and gladness.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A marriage was being celebrated, in which the beautiful&#10;Helga, glittering in silk and jewels, was the bride, and the&#10;bridegroom the young Arab prince. Bride and bridegroom sat at the&#10;upper end of the table, between the bride&#39;s mother and grandfather.&#10;But her gaze was not on the bridegroom, with his manly, sunburnt&#10;face, round which curled a black beard, and whose dark fiery eyes&#10;were fixed upon her; but away from him, at a twinkling star, that&#10;shone down upon her from the sky. Then was heard the sound of&#10;rushing wings beating the air. The storks were coming home; and the&#10;old stork pair, although tired with the journey and requiring rest,&#10;did not fail to fly down at once to the balustrades of the&#10;verandah, for they knew already what feast was being celebrated.&#10;They had heard of it on the borders of the land, and also that&#10;Helga had caused their figures to be represented on the walls, for&#10;they belonged to her history.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I call that very sensible and pretty,&#34; said&#10;stork-papa.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, but it is very little,&#34; said mamma stork; &#34;they&#10;could not possibly have done less.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But, when Helga saw them, she rose and went out into the&#10;verandah to stroke the backs of the storks. The old stork pair&#10;bowed their heads, and curved their necks, and even the youngest&#10;among the young ones felt honored by this reception.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Helga continued to gaze upon the glittering star, which&#10;seemed to glow brighter and purer in its light; then between&#10;herself and the star floated a form, purer than the air, and&#10;visible through it. It floated quite near to her, and she saw that&#10;it was the dead Christian priest, who also was coming to her&#10;wedding feast&#8212;coming from the heavenly kingdom.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The glory and brightness, yonder, outshines all that is&#10;known on earth,&#34; said he.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then Helga the fair prayed more gently, and more&#10;earnestly, than she had ever prayed in her life before, that she&#10;might be permitted to gaze, if only for a single moment, at the&#10;glory and brightness of the heavenly kingdom. Then she felt herself&#10;lifted up, as it were, above the earth, through a sea of sound and&#10;thought; not only around her, but within her, was there light and&#10;song, such as words cannot express.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Now we must return;&#34; he said; &#34;you will be&#10;missed.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Only one more look,&#34; she begged; &#34;but one short moment&#10;more.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;We must return to earth; the guests will have all&#10;departed. Only one more look!&#8212;the last!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then Helga stood again in the verandah. But the marriage&#10;lamps in the festive hall had been all extinguished, and the&#10;torches outside had vanished. The storks were gone; not a guest&#10;could be seen; no bridegroom&#8212;all in those few short moments seemed&#10;to have died. Then a great dread fell upon her. She stepped from&#10;the verandah through the empty hall into the next chamber, where&#10;slept strange warriors. She opened a side door, which once led into&#10;her own apartment, but now, as she passed through, she found&#10;herself suddenly in a garden which she had never before seen here,&#10;the sky blushed red, it was the dawn of morning. Three minutes only&#10;in heaven, and a whole night on earth had passed away! Then she saw&#10;the storks, and called to them in their own language.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then stork-papa turned his head towards here, listened to&#10;her words, and drew near. &#34;You speak our language,&#34; said he, &#34;what&#10;do you wish? Why do you appear,&#8212;you&#8212;a strange woman?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It is I&#8212;it is Helga! Dost thou not know me? Three minutes&#10;ago we were speaking together yonder in the verandah.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That is a mistake,&#34; said the stork, &#34;you must have&#10;dreamed all this.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No, no,&#34; she exclaimed. Then she reminded him of the&#10;Viking&#39;s castle, of the great lake, and of the journey across the&#10;ocean.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then stork-papa winked his eyes, and said, &#34;Why that&#39;s an&#10;old story which happened in the time of my grandfather. There&#10;certainly was a princess of that kind here in Egypt once, who came&#10;from the Danish land, but she vanished on the evening of her&#10;wedding day, many hundred years ago, and never came back. You may&#10;read about it yourself yonder, on a monument in the garden. There&#10;you will find swans and storks sculptured, and on the top is a&#10;figure of the princess Helga, in marble.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And so it was; Helga understood it all now, and sank on&#10;her knees. The sun burst forth in all its glory, and, as in olden&#10;times, the form of the frog vanished in his beams, and the&#10;beautiful form stood forth in all its loveliness; so now, bathed in&#10;light, rose a beautiful form, purer, clearer than air&#8212;a ray of&#10;brightness&#8212;from the Source of light Himself. The body crumbled into&#10;dust, and a faded lotus-flower lay on the spot on which Helga had&#10;stood.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Now that is a new ending to the story,&#34; said stork-papa;&#10;&#34;I really never expected it would end in this way, but it seems a&#10;very good ending.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And what will the young ones say to it, I wonder?&#34; said&#10;stork-mamma.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ah, that is a very important question,&#34; replied the&#10;stork. &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Metal Pig'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;IN the city of Florence, not far from the Piazza del&#10;Granduca, runs a little street called Porta Rosa. In this street,&#10;just in front of the market-place where vegetables are sold, stands&#10;a pig, made of brass and curiously formed. The bright color has&#10;been changed by age to dark green; but clear, fresh water pours&#10;from the snout, which shines as if it had been polished, and so&#10;indeed it has, for hundreds of poor people and children seize it in&#10;their hands as they place their mouths close to the mouth of the&#10;animal, to drink. It is quite a picture to see a half-naked boy&#10;clasping the well-formed creature by the head, as he presses his&#10;rosy lips against its jaws. Every one who visits Florence can very&#10;quickly find the place; he has only to ask the first beggar he&#10;meets for the Metal Pig, and he will be told where it&#10;is.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was late on a winter evening; the mountains were&#10;covered with snow, but the moon shone brightly, and moonlight in&#10;Italy is like a dull winter&#39;s day in the north; indeed it is&#10;better, for clear air seems to raise us above the earth, while in&#10;the north a cold, gray, leaden sky appears to press us down to&#10;earth, even as the cold damp earth shall one day press on us in the&#10;grave. In the garden of the grand duke&#39;s palace, under the roof of&#10;one of the wings, where a thousand roses bloom in winter, a little&#10;ragged boy had been sitting the whole day long; a boy, who might&#10;serve as a type of Italy, lovely and smiling, and yet still&#10;suffering. He was hungry and thirsty, yet no one gave him anything;&#10;and when it became dark, and they were about to close the gardens,&#10;the porter turned him out. He stood a long time musing on the&#10;bridge which crosses the Arno, and looking at the glittering stars,&#10;reflected in the water which flowed between him and the elegant&#10;marble bridge Della Trinita. He then walked away towards the Metal&#10;Pig, half knelt down, clasped it with his arms, and then put his&#10;mouth to the shining snout and drank deep draughts of the fresh&#10;water. Close by, lay a few salad-leaves and two chestnuts, which&#10;were to serve for his supper. No one was in the street but himself;&#10;it belonged only to him, so he boldly seated himself on the pig&#39;s&#10;back, leaned forward so that his curly head could rest on the head&#10;of the animal, and, before he was aware, he fell asleep.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was midnight. The Metal Pig raised himself gently, and&#10;the boy heard him say quite distinctly, &#34;Hold tight, little boy,&#10;for I am going to run;&#34; and away he started for a most wonderful&#10;ride. First, they arrived at the Piazza del Granduca, and the metal&#10;horse which bears the duke&#39;s statue, neighed aloud. The painted&#10;coats-of-arms on the old council-house shone like transparent&#10;pictures, and Michael Angelo&#39;s David tossed his sling; it was as if&#10;everything had life. The metallic groups of figures, among which&#10;were Perseus and the Rape of the Sabines, looked like living&#10;persons, and cries of terror sounded from them all across the noble&#10;square. By the Palazzo degli Uffizi, in the arcade, where the&#10;nobility assemble for the carnival, the Metal Pig stopped. &#34;Hold&#10;fast,&#34; said the animal; &#34;hold fast, for I am going up&#10;stairs.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The little boy said not a word; he was half pleased and&#10;half afraid. They entered a long gallery, where the boy had been&#10;before. The walls were resplendent with paintings; here stood&#10;statues and busts, all in a clear light as if it were day. But the&#10;grandest appeared when the door of a side room opened; the little&#10;boy could remember what beautiful things he had seen there, but&#10;to-night everything shone in its brightest colors. Here stood the&#10;figure of a beautiful woman, as beautifully sculptured as possible&#10;by one of the great masters. Her graceful limbs appeared to move;&#10;dolphins sprang at her feet, and immortality shone from her eyes.&#10;The world called her the Venus de&#39; Medici. By her side were&#10;statues, in which the spirit of life breathed in stone; figures of&#10;men, one of whom whetted his sword, and was named the Grinder;&#10;wrestling gladiators formed another group, the sword had been&#10;sharpened for them, and they strove for the goddess of beauty. The&#10;boy was dazzled by so much glitter; for the walls were gleaming&#10;with bright colors, all appeared living reality.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;As they passed from hall to hall, beauty everywhere showed&#10;itself; and as the Metal Pig went step by step from one picture to&#10;the other, the little boy could see it all plainly. One glory&#10;eclipsed another; yet there was one picture that fixed itself on&#10;the little boy&#39;s memory, more especially because of the happy&#10;children it represented, for these the little boy had seen in&#10;daylight. Many pass this picture by with indifference, and yet it&#10;contains a treasure of poetic feeling; it represents Christ&#10;descending into Hades. They are not the lost whom the spectator&#10;sees, but the heathen of olden times. The Florentine, Angiolo&#10;Bronzino, painted this picture; most beautiful is the expression on&#10;the face of the two children, who appear to have full confidence&#10;that they shall reach heaven at last. They are embracing each&#10;other, and one little one stretches out his hand towards another&#10;who stands below him, and points to himself, as if he were saying,&#10;&#34;I am going to heaven.&#34; The older people stand as if uncertain, yet&#10;hopeful, and they bow in humble adoration to the Lord Jesus. On&#10;this picture the boy&#39;s eyes rested longer than on any other: the&#10;Metal Pig stood still before it. A low sigh was heard. Did it come&#10;from the picture or from the animal? The boy raised his hands&#10;towards the smiling children, and then the Pig ran off with him&#10;through the open vestibule.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Thank you, thank you, you beautiful animal,&#34; said the&#10;little boy, caressing the Metal Pig as it ran down the&#10;steps.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Thanks to yourself also,&#34; replied the Metal Pig; &#34;I have&#10;helped you and you have helped me, for it is only when I have an&#10;innocent child on my back that I receive the power to run. Yes; as&#10;you see, I can even venture under the rays of the lamp, in front of&#10;the picture of the Madonna, but I may not enter the church; still&#10;from without, and while you are upon my back, I may look in through&#10;the open door. Do not get down yet, for if you do, then I shall be&#10;lifeless, as you have seen me in the Porta Rosa.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I will stay with you, my dear creature,&#34; said the little&#10;boy. So then they went on at a rapid pace through the streets of&#10;Florence, till they came to the square before the church of Santa&#10;Croce. The folding-doors flew open, and light streamed from the&#10;altar through the church into the deserted square. A wonderful&#10;blaze of light streamed from one of the monuments in the left-side&#10;aisle, and a thousand moving stars seemed to form a glory round it;&#10;even the coat-of-arms on the tomb-stone shone, and a red ladder on&#10;a blue field gleamed like fire. It was the grave of Galileo. The&#10;monument is unadorned, but the red ladder is an emblem of art,&#10;signifying that the way to glory leads up a shining ladder, on&#10;which the prophets of mind rise to heaven, like Elias of old. In&#10;the right aisle of the church every statue on the richly carved&#10;sarcophagi seemed endowed with life. Here stood Michael Angelo;&#10;there Dante, with the laurel wreath round his brow; Alfieri and&#10;Machiavelli; for here side by side rest the great men&#8212;the pride of&#10;Italy. The church itself is very beautiful, even more beautiful&#10;than the marble cathedral at Florence, though not so large. It&#10;seemed as if the carved vestments stirred, and as if the marble&#10;figures they covered raised their heads higher, to gaze upon the&#10;brightly colored glowing altar where the white-robed boys swung the&#10;golden censers, amid music and song, while the strong fragrance of&#10;incense filled the church, and streamed forth into the square. The&#10;boy stretched forth his hands towards the light, and at the same&#10;moment the Metal Pig started again so rapidly that he was obliged&#10;to cling tightly to him. The wind whistled in his ears, he heard&#10;the church door creak on its hinges as it closed, and it seemed to&#10;him as if he had lost his senses&#8212;then a cold shudder passed over&#10;him, and he awoke.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was morning; the Metal Pig stood in its old place on&#10;the Porta Rosa, and the boy found he had slipped nearly off its&#10;back. Fear and trembling came upon him as he thought of his mother;&#10;she had sent him out the day before to get some money, he had not&#10;done so, and now he was hungry and thirsty. Once more he clasped&#10;the neck of his metal horse, kissed its nose, and nodded farewell&#10;to it. Then he wandered away into one of the narrowest streets,&#10;where there was scarcely room for a loaded donkey to pass. A great&#10;iron-bound door stood ajar; he passed through, and climbed up a&#10;brick staircase, with dirty walls and a rope for a balustrade, till&#10;he came to an open gallery hung with rags. From here a flight of&#10;steps led down to a court, where from a well water was drawn up by&#10;iron rollers to the different stories of the house, and where the&#10;water-buckets hung side by side. Sometimes the roller and the&#10;bucket danced in the air, splashing the water all over the court.&#10;Another broken-down staircase led from the gallery, and two Russian&#10;sailors running down it almost upset the poor boy. They were coming&#10;from their nightly carousal. A woman not very young, with an&#10;unpleasant face and a quantity of black hair, followed them. &#34;What&#10;have you brought home?&#34; she asked. when she saw the boy.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Don&#39;t be angry,&#34; he pleaded; &#34;I received nothing, I have&#10;nothing at all;&#34; and he seized his mother&#39;s dress and would have&#10;kissed it. Then they went into a little room. I need not describe&#10;it, but only say that there stood in it an earthen pot with&#10;handles, made for holding fire, which in Italy is called a marito.&#10;This pot she took in her lap, warmed her fingers, and pushed the&#10;boy with her elbow.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Certainly you must have some money,&#34; she said. The boy&#10;began to cry, and then she struck him with her foot till he cried&#10;out louder.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Will you be quiet? or I&#39;ll break your screaming head;&#34;&#10;and she swung about the fire-pot which she held in her hand, while&#10;the boy crouched to the earth and screamed.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then a neighbor came in, and she had also a marito under&#10;her arm. &#34;Felicita,&#34; she said, &#34;what are you doing to the&#10;child?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The child is mine,&#34; she answered; &#34;I can murder him if I&#10;like, and you too, Giannina.&#34; And then she swung about the&#10;fire-pot. The other woman lifted up hers to defend herself, and the&#10;two pots clashed together so violently that they were dashed to&#10;pieces, and fire and ashes flew about the room. The boy rushed out&#10;at the sight, sped across the courtyard, and fled from the house.&#10;The poor child ran till he was quite out of breath; at last he&#10;stopped at the church, the doors of which were opened to him the&#10;night before, and went in. Here everything was bright, and the boy&#10;knelt down by the first tomb on his right, the grave of Michael&#10;Angelo, and sobbed as if his heart would break. People came and&#10;went, mass was performed, but no one noticed the boy, excepting an&#10;elderly citizen, who stood still and looked at him for a moment,&#10;and then went away like the rest. Hunger and thirst overpowered the&#10;child, and he became quite faint and ill. At last he crept into a&#10;corner behind the marble monuments, and went to sleep. Towards&#10;evening he was awakened by a pull at his sleeve; he started up, and&#10;the same old citizen stood before him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Are you ill? where do you live? have you been here all&#10;day?&#34; were some of the questions asked by the old man. After&#10;hearing his answers, the old man took him home to a small house&#10;close by, in a back street. They entered a glovemaker&#39;s shop, where&#10;a woman sat sewing busily. A little white poodle, so closely shaven&#10;that his pink skin could plainly be seen, frisked about the room,&#10;and gambolled upon the boy.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Innocent souls are soon intimate,&#34; said the woman, as she&#10;caressed both the boy and the dog. These good people gave the child&#10;food and drink, and said he should stay with them all night, and&#10;that the next day the old man, who was called Giuseppe, would go&#10;and speak to his mother. A little homely bed was prepared for him,&#10;but to him who had so often slept on the hard stones it was a royal&#10;couch, and he slept sweetly and dreamed of the splendid pictures&#10;and of the Metal Pig. Giuseppe went out the next morning, and the&#10;poor child was not glad to see him go, for he knew that the old man&#10;was gone to his mother, and that, perhaps, he would have to go&#10;back. He wept at the thought, and then he played with the little,&#10;lively dog, and kissed it, while the old woman looked kindly at him&#10;to encourage him. And what news did Giuseppe bring back? At first&#10;the boy could not hear, for he talked a great deal to his wife, and&#10;she nodded and stroked the boy&#39;s cheek.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then she said, &#34;He is a good lad, he shall stay with us,&#10;he may become a clever glovemaker, like you. Look what delicate&#10;fingers he has got; Madonna intended him for a glovemaker.&#34; So the&#10;boy stayed with them, and the woman herself taught him to sew; and&#10;he ate well, and slept well, and became very merry. But at last he&#10;began to tease Bellissima, as the little dog was called. This made&#10;the woman angry, and she scolded him and threatened him, which made&#10;him very unhappy, and he went and sat in his own room full of sad&#10;thoughts. This chamber looked upon the street, in which hung skins&#10;to dry, and there were thick iron bars across his window. That&#10;night he lay awake, thinking of the Metal Pig; indeed, it was&#10;always in his thoughts. Suddenly he fancied he heard feet outside&#10;going pit-a-pat. He sprung out of bed and went to the window. Could&#10;it be the Metal Pig? But there was nothing to be seen; whatever he&#10;had heard had passed already. Next morning, their neighbor, the&#10;artist, passed by, carrying a paint-box and a large roll of&#10;canvas.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Help the gentleman to carry his box of colors,&#34; said the&#10;woman to the boy; and he obeyed instantly, took the box, and&#10;followed the painter. They walked on till they reached the picture&#10;gallery, and mounted the same staircase up which he had ridden that&#10;night on the Metal Pig. He remembered all the statues and pictures,&#10;the beautiful marble Venus, and again he looked at the Madonna with&#10;the Saviour and St. John. They stopped before the picture by&#10;Bronzino, in which Christ is represented as standing in the lower&#10;world, with the children smiling before Him, in the sweet&#10;expectation of entering heaven; and the poor boy smiled, too, for&#10;here was his heaven.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You may go home now,&#34; said the painter, while the boy&#10;stood watching him, till he had set up his easel.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;May I see you paint?&#34; asked the boy; &#34;may I see you put&#10;the picture on this white canvas?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I am not going to paint yet,&#34; replied the artist; then he&#10;brought out a piece of chalk. His hand moved quickly, and his eye&#10;measured the great picture; and though nothing appeared but a faint&#10;line, the figure of the Saviour was as clearly visible as in the&#10;colored picture.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Why don&#39;t you go?&#34; said the painter. Then the boy&#10;wandered home silently, and seated himself on the table, and&#10;learned to sew gloves. But all day long his thoughts were in the&#10;picture gallery; and so he pricked his fingers and was awkward. But&#10;he did not tease Bellissima. When evening came, and the house door&#10;stood open, he slipped out. It was a bright, beautiful, starlight&#10;evening, but rather cold. Away he went through the already-deserted&#10;streets, and soon came to the Metal Pig; he stooped down and kissed&#10;its shining nose, and then seated himself on its back.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You happy creature,&#34; he said; &#34;how I have longed for you!&#10;we must take a ride to-night.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But the Metal Pig lay motionless, while the fresh stream&#10;gushed forth from its mouth. The little boy still sat astride on&#10;its back, when he felt something pulling at his clothes. He looked&#10;down, and there was Bellissima, little smooth-shaven Bellissima,&#10;barking as if she would have said, &#34;Here I am too; why are you&#10;sitting there?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A fiery dragon could not have frightened the little boy so&#10;much as did the little dog in this place. &#34;Bellissima in the&#10;street, and not dressed!&#34; as the old lady called it; &#34;what would be&#10;the end of this?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The dog never went out in winter, unless she was attired&#10;in a little lambskin coat which had been made for her; it was&#10;fastened round the little dog&#39;s neck and body with red ribbons, and&#10;was decorated with rosettes and little bells. The dog looked almost&#10;like a little kid when she was allowed to go out in winter, and&#10;trot after her mistress. And now here she was in the cold, and not&#10;dressed. Oh, how would it end? All his fancies were quickly put to&#10;flight; yet he kissed the Metal Pig once more, and then took&#10;Bellissima in his arms. The poor little thing trembled so with&#10;cold, that the boy ran homeward as fast as he could.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What are you running away with there?&#34; asked two of the&#10;police whom he met, and at whom the dog barked. &#34;Where have you&#10;stolen that pretty dog?&#34; they asked; and they took it away from&#10;him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, I have not stolen it; do give it to me back again,&#34;&#10;cried the boy, despairingly.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;If you have not stolen it, you may say at home that they&#10;can send to the watch-house for the dog.&#34; Then they told him where&#10;the watch-house was, and went away with Bellissima.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Here was a dreadful trouble. The boy did not know whether&#10;he had better jump into the Arno, or go home and confess&#10;everything. They would certainly kill him, he thought.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Well, I would gladly be killed,&#34; he reasoned; &#34;for then I&#10;shall die, and go to heaven:&#34; and so he went home, almost hoping&#10;for death.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The door was locked, and he could not reach the knocker.&#10;No one was in the street; so he took up a stone, and with it made a&#10;tremendous noise at the door.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Who is there?&#34; asked somebody from within.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It is I,&#34; said he. &#34;Bellissima is gone. Open the door,&#10;and then kill me.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then indeed there was a great panic. Madame was so very&#10;fond of Bellissima. She immediately looked at the wall where the&#10;dog&#39;s dress usually hung; and there was the little&#10;lambskin.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Bellissima in the watch-house!&#34; she cried. &#34;You bad boy!&#10;how did you entice her out? Poor little delicate thing, with those&#10;rough policemen! and she&#39;ll be frozen with cold.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Giuseppe went off at once, while his wife lamented, and&#10;the boy wept. Several of the neighbors came in, and amongst them&#10;the painter. He took the boy between his knees, and questioned him;&#10;and, in broken sentences, he soon heard the whole story, and also&#10;about the Metal Pig, and the wonderful ride to the picture-gallery,&#10;which was certainly rather incomprehensible. The painter, however,&#10;consoled the little fellow, and tried to soften the lady&#39;s anger;&#10;but she would not be pacified till her husband returned with&#10;Bellissima, who had been with the police. Then there was great&#10;rejoicing, and the painter caressed the boy, and gave him a number&#10;of pictures. Oh, what beautiful pictures these were!&#8212;figures with&#10;funny heads; and, above all, the Metal Pig was there too. Oh,&#10;nothing could be more delightful. By means of a few strokes, it was&#10;made to appear on the paper; and even the house that stood behind&#10;it had been sketched in. Oh, if he could only draw and paint! He&#10;who could do this could conjure all the world before him. The first&#10;leisure moment during the next day, the boy got a pencil, and on&#10;the back of one of the other drawings he attempted to copy the&#10;drawing of the Metal Pig, and he succeeded. Certainly it was rather&#10;crooked, rather up and down, one leg thick, and another thin; still&#10;it was like the copy, and he was overjoyed at what he had done. The&#10;pencil would not go quite as it ought,&#8212;he had found that out; but&#10;the next day he tried again. A second pig was drawn by the side of&#10;the first, and this looked a hundred times better; and the third&#10;attempt was so good, that everybody might know what it was meant to&#10;represent.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And now the glovemaking went on but slowly. The orders&#10;given by the shops in the town were not finished quickly; for the&#10;Metal Pig had taught the boy that all objects may be drawn upon&#10;paper; and Florence is a picture-book in itself for any one who&#10;chooses to turn over its pages. On the Piazza dell Trinita stands a&#10;slender pillar, and upon it is the goddess of Justice, blindfolded,&#10;with her scales in her hand. She was soon represented on paper, and&#10;it was the glovemaker&#39;s boy who placed her there. His collection of&#10;pictures increased; but as yet they were only copies of lifeless&#10;objects, when one day Bellissima came gambolling before him: &#34;Stand&#10;still,&#34; cried he, &#34;and I will draw you beautifully, to put amongst&#10;my collection.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But Bellissima would not stand still, so she must be bound&#10;fast in one position. He tied her head and tail; but she barked and&#10;jumped, and so pulled and tightened the string, that she was nearly&#10;strangled; and just then her mistress walked in.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You wicked boy! the poor little creature!&#34; was all she&#10;could utter.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;She pushed the boy from her, thrust him away with her&#10;foot, called him a most ungrateful, good-for-nothing, wicked boy,&#10;and forbade him to enter the house again. Then she wept, and kissed&#10;her little half-strangled Bellissima. At this moment the painter&#10;entered the room.&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;hr /&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the year 1834 there was an exhibition in the Academy of&#10;Arts at Florence. Two pictures, placed side by side, attracted a&#10;large number of spectators. The smaller of the two represented a&#10;little boy sitting at a table, drawing; before him was a little&#10;white poodle, curiously shaven; but as the animal would not stand&#10;still, it had been fastened with a string to its head and tail, to&#10;keep it in one position. The truthfulness and life in this picture&#10;interested every one. The painter was said to be a young&#10;Florentine, who had been found in the streets, when a child, by an&#10;old glovemaker, who had brought him up. The boy had taught himself&#10;to draw: it was also said that a young artist, now famous, had&#10;discovered talent in the child just as he was about to be sent away&#10;for having tied up madame&#39;s favorite little dog, and using it as a&#10;model. The glovemaker&#39;s boy had also become a great painter, as the&#10;picture proved; but the larger picture by its side was a still&#10;greater proof of his talent. It represented a handsome boy, clothed&#10;in rags, lying asleep, and leaning against the Metal Pig in the&#10;street of the Porta Rosa. All the spectators knew the spot well.&#10;The child&#39;s arms were round the neck of the Pig, and he was in a&#10;deep sleep. The lamp before the picture of the Madonna threw a&#10;strong, effective light on the pale, delicate face of the child. It&#10;was a beautiful picture. A large gilt frame surrounded it, and on&#10;one corner of the frame a laurel wreath had been hung; but a black&#10;band, twined unseen among the green leaves, and a streamer of&#10;crape, hung down from it; for within the last few days the young&#10;artist had&#8212;died. &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#38;#160;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Money-Box'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;IN a nursery where a number of toys lay scattered about, a&#10;money-box stood on the top of a very high wardrobe. It was made of&#10;clay in the shape of a pig, and had been bought of the potter. In&#10;the back of the pig was a slit, and this slit had been enlarged&#10;with a knife, so that dollars, or crown pieces, might slip through;&#10;and, indeed there were two in the box, besides a number of pence.&#10;The money-pig was stuffed so full that it could no longer rattle,&#10;which is the highest state of perfection to which a money-pig can&#10;attain. There he stood upon the cupboard, high and lofty, looking&#10;down upon everything else in the room. He knew very well that he&#10;had enough inside him to buy up all the other toys, and this gave&#10;him a very good opinion of his own value. The rest thought of this&#10;fact also, although they did not express it, for there were so many&#10;other things to talk about. A large doll, still handsome, though&#10;rather old, for her neck had been mended, lay inside one of the&#10;drawers which was partly open. She called out to the others, &#34;Let&#10;us have a game at being men and women, that is something worth&#10;playing at.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Upon this there was a great uproar; even the engravings,&#10;which hung in frames on the wall, turned round in their excitement,&#10;and showed that they had a wrong side to them, although they had&#10;not the least intention to expose themselves in this way, or to&#10;object to the game. It was late at night, but as the moon shone&#10;through the windows, they had light at a cheap rate. And as the&#10;game was now to begin, all were invited to take part in it, even&#10;the children&#39;s wagon, which certainly belonged to the coarser&#10;playthings. &#34;Each has its own value,&#34; said the wagon; &#34;we cannot&#10;all be noblemen; there must be some to do the work.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The money-pig was the only one who received a written&#10;invitation. He stood so high that they were afraid he would not&#10;accept a verbal message. But in his reply, he said, if he had to&#10;take a part, he must enjoy the sport from his own home; they were&#10;to arrange for him to do so; and so they did. The little toy&#10;theatre was therefore put up in such a way that the money-pig could&#10;look directly into it. Some wanted to begin with a comedy, and&#10;afterwards to have a tea party and a discussion for mental&#10;improvement, but they commenced with the latter first. The&#10;rocking-horse spoke of training and races; the wagon of railways&#10;and steam power, for these subjects belonged to each of their&#10;professions, and it was right they should talk of them. The clock&#10;talked politics&#8212;&#34;tick, tick;&#34; he professed to know what was the&#10;time of day, but there was a whisper that he did not go correctly.&#10;The bamboo cane stood by, looking stiff and proud: he was vain of&#10;his brass ferrule and silver top, and on the sofa lay two worked&#10;cushions, pretty but stupid. When the play at the little theatre&#10;began, the rest sat and looked on; they were requested to applaud&#10;and stamp, or crack, when they felt gratified with what they saw.&#10;But the riding-whip said he never cracked for old people, only for&#10;the young who were not yet married. &#34;I crack for everybody,&#34; said&#10;the cracker.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, and a fine noise you make,&#34; thought the audience, as&#10;the play went on.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was not worth much, but it was very well played, and&#10;all the characters turned their painted sides to the audience, for&#10;they were made only to be seen on one side. The acting was&#10;wonderful, excepting that sometimes they came out beyond the lamps,&#10;because the wires were a little too long. The doll, whose neck had&#10;been darned, was so excited that the place in her neck burst, and&#10;the money-pig declared he must do something for one of the players,&#10;as they had all pleased him so much. So he made up his mind to&#10;remember one of them in his will, as the one to be buried with him&#10;in the family vault, whenever that event should happen. They all&#10;enjoyed the comedy so much, that they gave up all thoughts of the&#10;tea party, and only carried out their idea of intellectual&#10;amusement, which they called playing at men and women; and there&#10;was nothing wrong about it, for it was only play. All the while,&#10;each one thought most of himself, or of what the money-pig could be&#10;thinking. His thoughts were on, as he supposed, a very distant&#10;time&#8212;of making his will, and of his burial, and of when it might&#10;all come to pass. Certainly sooner than he expected&#8212;for all at once&#10;down he came from the top of the press, fell on the ground, and was&#10;broken to pieces. Then the pennies hopped and danced about in the&#10;most amusing manner. The little ones twirled round like tops, and&#10;the large ones rolled away as far as they could, especially the one&#10;great silver crown piece who had often to go out into the world,&#10;and now he had his wish as well as all the rest of the money. The&#10;pieces of the money-pig were thrown into the dust-bin, and the next&#10;day there stood a new money-pig on the cupboard, but it had not a&#10;farthing in its inside yet, and therefore, like the old one, it&#10;could not rattle. This was the beginning with him, and we will make&#10;it the end of our story. &#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Neighbouring Families'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;ONE would have thought that something important was going&#10;on in the duck-pond, but it was nothing after all. All the ducks&#10;lying quietly on the water or standing on their heads in it&#8212;for&#10;they could do that&#8212;at once swarm to the sides; the traces of their&#10;feet were seen in the wet earth, and their cackling was heard far&#10;and wide. The water, which a few moments before had been as clear&#10;and smooth as a mirror, became very troubled. Before, every tree,&#10;every neighbouring bush, the old farmhouse with the holes in the&#10;roof and the swallows&#39; nest, and especially the great rose-bush&#10;full of flowers, had been reflected in it. The rose-bush covered&#10;the wall and hung out over the water, in which everything was seen&#10;as if in a picture, except that it all stood on its head; but when&#10;the water was troubled everything got mixed up, and the picture was&#10;gone. Two feathers which the fluttering ducks had lost floated up&#10;and down; suddenly they took a rush as if the wind were coming, but&#10;as it did not come they had to lie still, and the water once more&#10;became quiet and smooth. The roses were again reflected; they were&#10;very beautiful, but they did not know it, for no one had told them.&#10;The sun shone among the delicate leaves; everything breathed forth&#10;the loveliest fragrance, and all felt as we do when we are filled&#10;with joy at the thought of our happiness.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;How beautiful existence is!&#34; said each rose. &#34;The only&#10;thing that I wish for is to be able to kiss the sun, because it is&#10;so warm and bright. I should also like to kiss those roses down in&#10;the water, which are so much like us, and the pretty little birds&#10;down in the nest. There are some up above too; they put out their&#10;heads and pipe softly; they have no feathers like their father and&#10;mother. We have good neighbours, both below and above. How&#10;beautiful existence is!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The young ones above and below&#8212;those below were really&#10;only shadows in the water&#8212;were sparrows; their parents were&#10;sparrows too, and had taken possession of the empty swallows&#39; nest&#10;of last year, and now lived in it as if it were their own&#10;property.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Are those the duck&#39;s children swimming here?&#34; asked the&#10;young sparrows when they saw the feathers on the water.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;If you must ask questions, ask sensible ones,&#34; said their&#10;mother. &#34;Don&#39;t you see that they are feathers, such as I wear and&#10;you will wear too? But ours are finer. Still, I should like to have&#10;them up in the nest, for they keep one warm. I am very curious to&#10;know what the ducks were so startled about; not about us,&#10;certainly, although I did say &#39;peep&#39; to you pretty loudly. The&#10;thick-headed roses ought to know why, but they know nothing at all;&#10;they only look at themselves and smell. I am heartily tired of such&#10;neighbours.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Listen to the dear little birds up there,&#34; said the&#10;roses; &#34;they begin to want to sing too, but are not able to manage&#10;it yet. But it will soon come. What a pleasure that must be! It is&#10;fine to have such cheerful neighbours.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Suddenly two horses came galloping up to be watered. A&#10;peasant boy rode on one, and he had taken off all his clothes&#10;except his large broad black hat. The boy whistled like a bird, and&#10;rode into the pond where it was deepest, and as he passed the&#10;rose-bush he plucked a rose and stuck it in his hat. Now he looked&#10;dressed, and rode on. The other roses looked after their sister,&#10;and asked each other, &#34;Where can she be going to?&#34; But none of them&#10;knew.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I should like to go out into the world for once,&#34; said&#10;one; &#34;but here at home among our green leaves it is beautiful too.&#10;The whole day long the sun shines bright and warm, and in the night&#10;the sky shines more beautifully still; we can see that through all&#10;the little holes in it.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;They meant the stars, but they knew no better.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;We make it lively about the house,&#34; said the&#10;sparrow-mother; &#34;and people say that a swallows&#39; nest brings luck;&#10;so they are glad of us. But such neighbours as ours! A rose-bush on&#10;the wall like that causes damp. I daresay it will be taken away;&#10;then we shall, perhaps, have some corn growing here. The roses are&#10;good for nothing but to be looked at and to be smelt, or at most to&#10;be stuck in a hat. Every year, as I have been told by my mother,&#10;they fall off. The farmer&#39;s wife preserves them and strews salt&#10;among them; then they get a French name which I neither can&#10;pronounce nor care to, and are put into the fire to make a nice&#10;smell. You see, that&#39;s their life; they exist only for the eye and&#10;the nose. Now you know.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the evening, when the gnats were playing about in the&#10;warm air and in the red clouds, the nightingale came and sang to&#10;the roses that the beautiful was like sunshine to the world, and&#10;that the beautiful lived for ever. The roses thought that the&#10;nightingale was singing about itself, and that one might easily&#10;have believed; they had no idea that the song was about them. But&#10;they were very pleased with it, and wondered whether all the little&#10;sparrows could become nightingales.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I understand the song of that bird very well,&#34; said the&#10;young sparrows. &#34;There was only one word that was not clear to me.&#10;What does &#39;the beautiful&#39; mean?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Nothing at all,&#34; answered their mother; &#34;that&#39;s only&#10;something external. Up at the Hall, where the pigeons have their&#10;own house, and corn and peas are strewn before them every day&#8212;I&#10;have dined with them myself, and that you shall do in time, too;&#10;for tell me what company you keep and I&#39;ll tell you who you are&#8212;up&#10;at the Hall they have two birds with green necks and a crest upon&#10;their heads; they can spread out their tails like a great wheel,&#10;and these are so bright with various colours that it makes one&#39;s&#10;eyes ache. These birds are called peacocks, and that is &#39;the&#10;beautiful.&#39; If they were only plucked a little they would look no&#10;better than the rest of us. I would have plucked them already if&#10;they had not been so big.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I&#39;ll pluck them,&#34; piped the young sparrow, who had no&#10;feathers yet.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the farmhouse lived a young married couple; they loved&#10;each other dearly, were industrious and active, and everything in&#10;their home looked very nice. On Sundays the young wife came down&#10;early, plucked a handful of the most beautiful roses, and put them&#10;into a glass of water, which she placed upon the&#10;cupboard.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Now I see that it is Sunday,&#34; said the husband, kissing&#10;his little wife. They sat down, read their hymn-book, and held each&#10;other by the hand, while the sun shone down upon the fresh roses&#10;and upon them.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;This sight is really too tedious,&#34; said the&#10;sparrow-mother, who could see into the room from her nest; and she&#10;flew away.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The same thing happened on the following Sunday, for every&#10;Sunday fresh roses were put into the glass; but the rose-bush&#10;bloomed as beautifully as ever. The young sparrows now had&#10;feathers, and wanted very much to fly with their mother; but she&#10;would not allow it, and so they had to stay at home. In one of her&#10;flights, however it may have happened, she was caught, before she&#10;was aware of it, in a horse-hair net which some boys had attached&#10;to a tree. The horse-hair was drawn tightly round her leg&#8212;as&#10;tightly as if the latter were to be cut off; she was in great pain&#10;and terror. The boys came running up and seized her, and in no&#10;gentle way either.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It&#39;s only a sparrow,&#34; they said; they did not, however,&#10;let her go, but took her home with them, and every time she cried&#10;they hit her on the beak.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the farmhouse was an old man who understood making soap&#10;into cakes and balls, both for shaving and washing. He was a merry&#10;old man, always wandering about. On seeing the sparrow which the&#10;boys had brought, and which they said they did not want, he asked,&#10;&#34;Shall we make it look very pretty?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;At these words an icy shudder ran through the&#10;sparrow-mother.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Out of his box, in which were the most beautiful colours,&#10;the old man took a quantity of shining leaf-gold, while the boys&#10;had to go and fetch some white of egg, with which the sparrow was&#10;to be smeared all over; the gold was stuck on to this, and the&#10;sparrow-mother was now gilded all over. But she, trembling in every&#10;limb, did not think of the adornment. Then the soap-man tore off a&#10;small piece from the red lining of his old jacket, and cutting it&#10;so as to make it look like a cock&#39;s comb, he stuck it to the bird&#39;s&#10;head.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Now you will see the gold-jacket fly,&#34; said the old man,&#10;letting the sparrow go, which flew away in deadly fear, with the&#10;sun shining upon her. How she glittered! All the sparrows, and even&#10;a crow&#8212;and an old boy he was too&#8212;were startled at the sight; but&#10;still they flew after her to learn what kind of strange bird she&#10;was.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Driven by fear and horror, she flew homeward; she was&#10;almost sinking fainting to the earth, while the flock of pursuing&#10;birds increased, some even attempting to peck at her.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Look at her! Look at her!&#34; they all cried.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Look at her! Look at her&#34; cried her little ones. as she&#10;approached the nest. &#34;That is certainly a young peacock, for it&#10;glitters in all colours; it makes one&#39;s eyes ache, as mother told&#10;us. Peep! that&#39;s &#39;the beautiful&#39;.&#34; And then they pecked at the bird&#10;with their little beaks so that it was impossible for her to get&#10;into the nest; she was so exhausted that she couldn&#39;t even say&#10;&#34;Peep!&#34; much less &#34;I am your own mother!&#34; The other birds, too, now&#10;fell upon the sparrow and plucked off feather after feather until&#10;she fell bleeding into the rose-bush.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Poor creature!&#34; said all the roses; &#34;only be still, and&#10;we will hide you. Lean your little head against us.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The sparrow spread out her wings once more, then drew them&#10;closely to her, and lay dead near the neighbouring family, the&#10;beautiful fresh roses.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Peep!&#34; sounded from the nest. &#34;Where can mother be so&#10;long? It&#39;s more than I can understand. It cannot be a trick of&#10;hers, and mean that we are now to take care of ourselves. She has&#10;left us the house as an inheritance; but to which of us is it to&#10;belong when we have families of our own?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, it won&#39;t do for you to stay with me when I increase&#10;my household with a wife and children,&#34;&#39; said the&#10;smallest.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I daresay I shall have more wives and children than you,&#34;&#10;said the second.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But I am the eldest!&#34; exclaimed the third. Then they all&#10;got excited; they hit out with their wings, pecked with their&#10;beaks, and flop! one after another was thrown out of the nest.&#10;There they lay with their anger, holding their heads on one side&#10;and blinking the eye that was turned upwards. That was their way of&#10;looking foolish.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;They could fly a little; by practice they learned to&#10;improve, and at last they agreed upon a sign by which to recognise&#10;each other if they should meet in the world later on. It was to be&#10;one &#34;Peep!&#34; and three scratches on the ground with the left&#10;foot.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The young one who had remained behind in the nest made&#10;himself as broad as he could, for he was the proprietor. But this&#10;greatness did not last long. In the night the red flames burst&#10;through the window and seized the roof, the dry straw blazed up&#10;high, and the whole house, together with the young sparrow, was&#10;burned. The two others, who wanted to marry, thus saved their lives&#10;by a stroke of luck.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;When the sun rose again and everything looked as refreshed&#10;as if it had had a quiet sleep, there only remained of the&#10;farmhouse a few black charred beams leaning against the chimney,&#10;which was now its own master. Thick smoke still rose from the&#10;ruins, but the rose-bush stood yonder, fresh, blooming, and&#10;untouched, every flower and every twig being reflected in the clear&#10;water.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;How beautifully the roses bloom before the ruined house,&#34;&#10;exclaimed a passer-by. &#34;A pleasanter picture cannot be imagined. I&#10;must have that.&#34; And the man took out of his portfolio a little&#10;book with white leaves: he was a painter, and with his pencil he&#10;drew the smoking house, the charred beams and the overhanging&#10;chimney, which bent more and more; in the foreground he put the&#10;large, blooming rose-bush, which presented a charming view. For its&#10;sake alone the whole picture had been drawn.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Later in the day the two sparrows who had been born there&#10;came by. &#34;Where is the house?&#34; they asked. &#34;Where is the nest?&#10;Peep! All is burned and our strong brother too. That&#39;s what he has&#10;now for keeping the nest. The roses got off very well; there they&#10;still stand with their red cheeks. They certainly do not mourn at&#10;their neighbours&#39; misfortunes. I don&#39;t want to talk to them, and it&#10;looks miserable here&#8212;that&#39;s my opinion.&#34; And away they&#10;went.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;On a beautiful sunny autumn day&#8212;one could almost have&#10;believed it was still the middle of summer&#8212;there hopped about in&#10;the dry clean-swept courtyard before the principal entrance of the&#10;Hall a number of black, white, and gaily-coloured pigeons, all&#10;shining in the sunlight. The pigeon-mothers said to their young&#10;ones: &#34;Stand in groups, stand in groups! for that looks much&#10;better.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What kind of creatures are those little grey ones that&#10;run about behind us?&#34; asked an old pigeon, with red and green in&#10;her eyes. &#34;Little grey ones! Little grey ones!&#34; she&#10;cried.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;They are sparrows, and good creatures. We have always had&#10;the reputation of being pious, so we will allow them to pick up the&#10;corn with us; they don&#39;t interrupt our talk, and they scrape so&#10;prettily when they bow.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Indeed they were continually making three foot-scrapings&#10;with the left foot and also said &#34;Peep!&#34; By this means they&#10;recognised each other, for they were the sparrows from the nest on&#10;the burned house.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Here is excellent fare!&#34; said the sparrow. The pigeons&#10;strutted round one another, puffed out their chests mightily, and&#10;had their own private views and opinions.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Do you see that pouter pigeon?&#34; said one to the other.&#10;&#34;Do you see how she swallows the peas? She eats too many, and the&#10;best ones too. Curoo! Curoo! How she lifts her crest, the ugly,&#10;spiteful creature! Curoo! Curoo!&#34; And the eyes of all sparkled with&#10;malice. &#34;Stand in groups! Stand in groups! Little grey ones, little&#10;grey ones! Curoo, curoo, curoo!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;So their chatter ran on, and so it will run on for&#10;thousands of years. The sparrows ate lustily; they listened&#10;attentively, and even stood in the ranks with the others, but it&#10;did not suit them at all. They were full, and so they left the&#10;pigeons, exchanging opinions about them, slipped in under the&#10;garden palings, and when they found the door leading into the house&#10;open, one of them, who was more than full, and therefore felt&#10;brave, hopped on to the threshold. &#34;Peep!&#34; said he; &#34;I may venture&#10;that.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Peep!&#34; said the other; &#34;so may I, and something more&#10;too!&#34; and he hopped into the room. No one was there; the third&#10;sparrow, seeing this, flew still farther into the room, exclaiming,&#10;&#34;All or nothing! It is a curious man&#39;s nest all the same; and what&#10;have they put up here? What is it?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Close to the sparrows the roses were blooming; they were&#10;reflected in the water, and the charred beams leaned against the&#10;overhanging chimney. &#34;Do tell me what this is. How comes this in a&#10;room at the Hall?&#34; And all three sparrows wanted to fly over the&#10;roses and the chimney, but flew against a flat wall. It was all a&#10;picture, a great splendid picture, which the artist had painted&#10;from a sketch.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Peep!&#34; said the sparrows, &#34;it&#39;s nothing. It only looks&#10;like something. Peep! that is &#39;the beautiful.&#39; Do you understand&#10;it? I don&#39;t.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And they flew away, for some people came into the&#10;room.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Days and years went by. The pigeons had often cooed, not&#10;to say growled&#8212;the spiteful creatures; the sparrows had been frozen&#10;in winter and had lived merrily in summer: they were all betrothed,&#10;or married, or whatever you like to call it. They had little ones,&#10;and of course each one thought his own the handsomest and&#10;cleverest; one flew this way, another that, and when they met they&#10;recognised each other by their &#34;Peep!&#34; and the three scrapes with&#10;the left foot. The eldest had remained an old maid and had no nest&#10;nor young ones. It was her pet idea to see a great city, so she&#10;flew to Copenhagen.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;There was a large house painted in many gay colours&#10;standing close to the castle and the canal, upon which latter were&#10;to be seen many ships laden with apples and pottery. The windows of&#10;the house were broader at the bottom than at the top, and when the&#10;sparrows looked through them, every room appeared to them like a&#10;tulip with the brightest colours and shades. But in the middle of&#10;the tulip stood white men, made of marble; a few were of plaster;&#10;still, looked at with sparrows&#39; eyes, that comes to the same thing.&#10;Up on the roof stood a metal chariot drawn by metal horses, and the&#10;goddess of Victory, also of metal, was driving. It was&#10;Thorwaldsen&#39;s Museum.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;How it shines! how it shines!&#34; said the maiden sparrow.&#10;&#34;I suppose that is &#39;the beautiful.&#39; Peep! But here it is larger&#10;than a peacock.&#34; She still remembered what in her childhood&#39;s days&#10;her mother had looked upon as the greatest among the beautiful. She&#10;flew down into the courtyard: there everything was extremely fine.&#10;Palms and branches were painted on the walls, and in the middle of&#10;the court stood a great blooming rose-tree spreading out its fresh&#10;boughs, covered with roses, over a grave. Thither flew the maiden&#10;sparrow, for she saw several of her own kind there. A &#34;peep&#34; and&#10;three foot-scrapings&#8212;in this way she had often greeted throughout&#10;the year, and no one here had responded, for those who are once&#10;parted do not meet every day; and so this greeting had become a&#10;habit with her. But to-day two old sparrows and a young one&#10;answered with a &#34;peep&#34; and the thrice-repeated scrape with the left&#10;foot.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ah! Good-day! good-day!&#34; They were two old ones from the&#10;nest and a little one of the family. &#34;Do we meet here? It&#39;s a grand&#10;place, but there&#39;s not much to eat. This is &#39;the beautiful.&#39;&#10;Peep!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Many people came out of the side rooms where the beautiful&#10;marble statues stood and approached the grave where lay the great&#10;master who had created these works of art. All stood with&#10;enraptured faces round Thorwaldsen&#39;s grave, and a few picked up the&#10;fallen rose-leaves and preserved them. They had come from afar: one&#10;from mighty England, others from Germany and France. The fairest of&#10;the ladies plucked one of the roses and hid it in her bosom. Then&#10;the sparrows thought that the roses reigned here, and that the&#10;house had been built for their sake. That appeared to them to be&#10;really too much, but since all the people showed their love for the&#10;roses, they did not wish to be behindhand. &#34;Peep!&#34; they said&#10;sweeping the ground with their tails, and blinking with one eye at&#10;the roses, they had not looked at them long before they were&#10;convinced that they were their old neighbours. And so they really&#10;were. The painter who had drawn the rose-bush near the ruined&#10;house, had afterwards obtained permission to dig it up, and had&#10;given it to the architect, for finer roses had never been seen. The&#10;architect had planted it upon Thorwaldsen&#39;s grave, where it bloomed&#10;as an emblem of &#39;the beautiful&#39; and yielded fragrant red&#10;rose-leaves to be carried as mementoes to distant lands.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Have you obtained an appointment here in the city?&#34; asked&#10;the sparrows. The roses nodded; they recognized their grey&#10;neighbours and were pleased to see them again. &#34;How glorious it is&#10;to live and to bloom, to see old friends again, and happy faces&#10;every day. It is as if every day were a festival.&#34; &#34;Peep!&#34; said the&#10;sparrows. &#34;Yes, they are really our old neighbours; we remember&#10;their origin near the pond. Peep! how they have got on. Yes, some&#10;succeed while they are asleep. Ah! there&#39;s a faded leaf; I can see&#10;that quite plainly.&#34; And they pecked at it till it fell off. But&#10;the tree stood there fresher and greener than ever; the roses&#10;bloomed in the sunshine on Thorwaldsen&#39;s grave and became&#10;associated with his immortal name.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)

The story I am going to tell you&#10;happened a great many years ago, so it is well to hear it now&#10;before it is forgotten. The emperor&#39;s palace was the most beautiful&#10;in the world. It was built entirely of porcelain, and very costly,&#10;but so delicate and brittle that whoever touched it was obliged to&#10;be careful. In the garden could be seen the most singular flowers,&#10;with pretty silver bells tied to them, which tinkled so that every&#10;one who passed could not help noticing the flowers. Indeed,&#10;everything in the emperor&#39;s garden was remarkable, and it extended&#10;so far that the gardener himself did not know where it ended. Those&#10;who travelled beyond its limits knew that there was a noble forest,&#10;with lofty trees, sloping down to the deep blue sea, and the great&#10;ships sailed under the shadow of its branches. In one of these&#10;trees lived a nightingale, who sang so beautifully that even the&#10;poor fishermen, who had so many other things to do, would stop and&#10;listen. Sometimes, when they went at night to spread their nets,&#10;they would hear her sing, and say, &#34;Oh, is not that beautiful?&#34; But&#10;when they returned to their fishing, they forgot the bird until the&#10;next night. Then they would hear it again, and exclaim &#34;Oh, how&#10;beautiful is the nightingale&#39;s song!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Travellers from every country in the world came to the&#10;city of the emperor, which they admired very much, as well as the&#10;palace and gardens; but when they heard the nightingale, they all&#10;declared it to be the best of all. And the travellers, on their&#10;return home, related what they had seen; and learned men wrote&#10;books, containing descriptions of the town, the palace, and the&#10;gardens; but they did not forget the nightingale, which was really&#10;the greatest wonder. And those who could write poetry composed&#10;beautiful verses about the nightingale, who lived in a forest near&#10;the deep sea. The books travelled all over the world, and some of&#10;them came into the hands of the emperor; and he sat in his golden&#10;chair, and, as he read, he nodded his approval every moment, for it&#10;pleased him to find such a beautiful description of his city, his&#10;palace, and his gardens. But when he came to the words, &#34;the&#10;nightingale is the most beautiful of all,&#34; he exclaimed, &#34;What is&#10;this? I know nothing of any nightingale. Is there such a bird in my&#10;empire? and even in my garden? I have never heard of it. Something,&#10;it appears, may be learnt from books.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then he called one of his lords-in-waiting, who was so&#10;high-bred, that when any in an inferior rank to himself spoke to&#10;him, or asked him a question, he would answer, &#34;Pooh,&#34; which means&#10;nothing.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;There is a very wonderful bird mentioned here, called a&#10;nightingale,&#34; said the emperor; &#34;they say it is the best thing in&#10;my large kingdom. Why have I not been told of it?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I have never heard the name,&#34; replied the cavalier; &#34;she&#10;has not been presented at court.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It is my pleasure that she shall appear this evening.&#34;&#10;said the emperor; the whole world knows what I possess better than&#10;I do myself.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I have never heard of her,&#34; said the cavalier; &#34;yet I&#10;will endeavor to find her.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But where was the nightingale to be found? The nobleman&#10;went up stairs and down, through halls and passages; yet none of&#10;those whom he met had heard of the bird. So he returned to the&#10;emperor, and said that it must be a fable, invented by those who&#10;had written the book. &#34;Your imperial majesty,&#34; said he, &#34;cannot&#10;believe everything contained in books; sometimes they are only&#10;fiction, or what is called the black art.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But the book in which I have read this account,&#34; said the&#10;emperor, &#34;was sent to me by the great and mighty emperor of Japan,&#10;and therefore it cannot contain a falsehood. I will hear the&#10;nightingale, she must be here this evening; she has my highest&#10;favor; and if she does not come, the whole court shall be trampled&#10;upon after supper is ended.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Tsing-pe!&#34; cried the lord-in-waiting, and again he ran up&#10;and down stairs, through all the halls and corridors; and half the&#10;court ran with him, for they did not like the idea of being&#10;trampled upon. There was a great inquiry about this wonderful&#10;nightingale, whom all the world knew, but who was unknown to the&#10;court.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;At last they met with a poor little girl in the kitchen,&#10;who said, &#34;Oh, yes, I know the nightingale quite well; indeed, she&#10;can sing. Every evening I have permission to take home to my poor&#10;sick mother the scraps from the table; she lives down by the&#10;sea-shore, and as I come back I feel tired, and I sit down in the&#10;wood to rest, and listen to the nightingale&#39;s song. Then the tears&#10;come into my eyes, and it is just as if my mother kissed&#10;me.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Little maiden,&#34; said the lord-in-waiting, &#34;I will obtain&#10;for you constant employment in the kitchen, and you shall have&#10;permission to see the emperor dine, if you will lead us to the&#10;nightingale; for she is invited for this evening to the palace.&#34; So&#10;she went into the wood where the nightingale sang, and half the&#10;court followed her. As they went along, a cow began&#10;lowing.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh,&#34; said a young courtier, &#34;now we have found her; what&#10;wonderful power for such a small creature; I have certainly heard&#10;it before.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No, that is only a cow lowing,&#34; said the little girl; &#34;we&#10;are a long way from the place yet.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then some frogs began to croak in the marsh.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Beautiful,&#34; said the young courtier again. &#34;Now I hear&#10;it, tinkling like little church bells.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No, those are frogs,&#34; said the little maiden; &#34;but I&#10;think we shall soon hear her now:&#34; and presently the nightingale&#10;began to sing.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Hark, hark! there she is,&#34; said the girl, &#34;and there she&#10;sits,&#34; she added, pointing to a little gray bird who was perched on&#10;a bough.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Is it possible?&#34; said the lord-in-waiting, &#34;I never&#10;imagined it would be a little, plain, simple thing like that. She&#10;has certainly changed color at seeing so many grand people around&#10;her.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Little nightingale,&#34; cried the girl, raising her voice,&#10;&#34;our most gracious emperor wishes you to sing before&#10;him.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;With the greatest pleasure,&#34; said the nightingale, and&#10;began to sing most delightfully.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It sounds like tiny glass bells,&#34; said the&#10;lord-in-waiting, &#34;and see how her little throat works. It is&#10;surprising that we have never heard this before; she will be a&#10;great success at court.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Shall I sing once more before the emperor?&#34; asked the&#10;nightingale, who thought he was present.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;My excellent little nightingale,&#34; said the courtier, &#34;I&#10;have the great pleasure of inviting you to a court festival this&#10;evening, where you will gain imperial favor by your charming&#10;song.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;My song sounds best in the green wood,&#34; said the bird;&#10;but still she came willingly when she heard the emperor&#39;s&#10;wish.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The palace was elegantly decorated for the occasion. The&#10;walls and floors of porcelain glittered in the light of a thousand&#10;lamps. Beautiful flowers, round which little bells were tied, stood&#10;in the corridors: what with the running to and fro and the draught,&#10;these bells tinkled so loudly that no one could speak to be heard.&#10;In the centre of the great hall, a golden perch had been fixed for&#10;the nightingale to sit on. The whole court was present, and the&#10;little kitchen-maid had received permission to stand by the door.&#10;She was not installed as a real court cook. All were in full dress,&#10;and every eye was turned to the little gray bird when the emperor&#10;nodded to her to begin. The nightingale sang so sweetly that the&#10;tears came into the emperor&#39;s eyes, and then rolled down his&#10;cheeks, as her song became still more touching and went to every&#10;one&#39;s heart. The emperor was so delighted that he declared the&#10;nightingale should have his gold slipper to wear round her neck,&#10;but she declined the honor with thanks: she had been sufficiently&#10;rewarded already. &#34;I have seen tears in an emperor&#39;s eyes,&#34; she&#10;said, &#34;that is my richest reward. An emperor&#39;s tears have wonderful&#10;power, and are quite sufficient honor for me;&#34; and then she sang&#10;again more enchantingly than ever.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That singing is a lovely gift;&#34; said the ladies of the&#10;court to each other; and then they took water in their mouths to&#10;make them utter the gurgling sounds of the nightingale when they&#10;spoke to any one, so thay they might fancy themselves nightingales.&#10;And the footmen and chambermaids also expressed their satisfaction,&#10;which is saying a great deal, for they are very difficult to&#10;please. In fact the nightingale&#39;s visit was most successful. She&#10;was now to remain at court, to have her own cage, with liberty to&#10;go out twice a day, and once during the night. Twelve servants were&#10;appointed to attend her on these occasions, who each held her by a&#10;silken string fastened to her leg. There was certainly not much&#10;pleasure in this kind of flying.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The whole city spoke of the wonderful bird, and when two&#10;people met, one said &#34;nightin,&#34; and the other said &#34;gale,&#34; and they&#10;understood what was meant, for nothing else was talked of. Eleven&#10;peddlers&#39; children were named after her, but not of them could sing&#10;a note.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;One day the emperor received a large packet on which was&#10;written &#34;The Nightingale.&#34; &#34;Here is no doubt a new book about our&#10;celebrated bird,&#34; said the emperor. But instead of a book, it was a&#10;work of art contained in a casket, an artificial nightingale made&#10;to look like a living one, and covered all over with diamonds,&#10;rubies, and sapphires. As soon as the artificial bird was wound up,&#10;it could sing like the real one, and could move its tail up and&#10;down, which sparkled with silver and gold. Round its neck hung a&#10;piece of ribbon, on which was written &#34;The Emperor of China&#39;s&#10;nightingale is poor compared with that of the Emperor of&#10;Japan&#39;s.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;This is very beautiful,&#34; exclaimed all who saw it, and he&#10;who had brought the artificial bird received the title of &#34;Imperial&#10;nightingale-bringer-in-chief.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Now they must sing together,&#34; said the court, &#34;and what a&#10;duet it will be.&#34; But they did not get on well, for the real&#10;nightingale sang in its own natural way, but the artificial bird&#10;sang only waltzes.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That is not a fault,&#34; said the music-master, &#34;it is quite&#10;perfect to my taste,&#34; so then it had to sing alone, and was as&#10;successful as the real bird; besides, it was so much prettier to&#10;look at, for it sparkled like bracelets and breast-pins. Three and&#10;thirty times did it sing the same tunes without being tired; the&#10;people would gladly have heard it again, but the emperor said the&#10;living nightingale ought to sing something. But where was she? No&#10;one had noticed her when she flew out at the open window, back to&#10;her own green woods.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What strange conduct,&#34; said the emperor, when her flight&#10;had been discovered; and all the courtiers blamed her, and said she&#10;was a very ungrateful creature.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But we have the best bird after all,&#34; said one, and then&#10;they would have the bird sing again, although it was the&#10;thirty-fourth time they had listened to the same piece, and even&#10;then they had not learnt it, for it was rather difficult. But the&#10;music-master praised the bird in the highest degree, and even&#10;asserted that it was better than a real nightingale, not only in&#10;its dress and the beautiful diamonds, but also in its musical&#10;power. &#34;For you must perceive, my chief lord and emperor, that with&#10;a real nightingale we can never tell what is going to be sung, but&#10;with this bird everything is settled. It can be opened and&#10;explained, so that people may understand how the waltzes are&#10;formed, and why one note follows upon another.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;This is exactly what we think,&#34; they all replied, and&#10;then the music-master received permission to exhibit the bird to&#10;the people on the following Sunday, and the emperor commanded that&#10;they should be present to hear it sing. When they heard it they&#10;were like people intoxicated; however it must have been with&#10;drinking tea, which is quite a Chinese custom. They all said &#34;Oh!&#34;&#10;and held up their forefingers and nodded, but a poor fisherman, who&#10;had heard the real nightingale, said, &#34;it sounds prettily enough,&#10;and the melodies are all alike; yet there seems something wanting,&#10;I cannot exactly tell what.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And after this the real nightingale was banished from the&#10;empire, and the artificial bird placed on a silk cushion close to&#10;the emperor&#39;s bed. The presents of gold and precious stones which&#10;had been received with it were round the bird, and it was now&#10;advanced to the title of &#34;Little Imperial Toilet Singer,&#34; and to&#10;the rank of No. 1 on the left hand; for the emperor considered the&#10;left side, on which the heart lies, as the most noble, and the&#10;heart of an emperor is in the same place as that of other&#10;people.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The music-master wrote a work, in twenty-five volumes,&#10;about the artificial bird, which was very learned and very long,&#10;and full of the most difficult Chinese words; yet all the people&#10;said they had read it, and understood it, for fear of being thought&#10;stupid and having their bodies trampled upon.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;So a year passed, and the emperor, the court, and all the&#10;other Chinese knew every little turn in the artificial bird&#39;s song;&#10;and for that same reason it pleased them better. They could sing&#10;with the bird, which they often did. The street-boys sang,&#10;&#34;Zi-zi-zi, cluck, cluck, cluck,&#34; and the emperor himself could sing&#10;it also. It was really most amusing.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;One evening, when the artificial bird was singing its&#10;best, and the emperor lay in bed listening to it, something inside&#10;the bird sounded &#34;whizz.&#34; Then a spring cracked. &#34;Whir-r-r-r&#34; went&#10;all the wheels, running round, and then the music stopped. The&#10;emperor immediately sprang out of bed, and called for his&#10;physician; but what could he do? Then they sent for a watchmaker;&#10;and, after a great deal of talking and examination, the bird was&#10;put into something like order; but he said that it must be used&#10;very carefully, as the barrels were worn, and it would be&#10;impossible to put in new ones without injuring the music. Now there&#10;was great sorrow, as the bird could only be allowed to play once a&#10;year; and even that was dangerous for the works inside it. Then the&#10;music-master made a little speech, full of hard words, and declared&#10;that the bird was as good as ever; and, of course no one&#10;contradicted him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Five years passed, and then a real grief came upon the&#10;land. The Chinese really were fond of their emperor, and he now lay&#10;so ill that he was not expected to live. Already a new emperor had&#10;been chosen and the people who stood in the street asked the&#10;lord-in-waiting how the old emperor was; but he only said, &#34;Pooh!&#34;&#10;and shook his head.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Cold and pale lay the emperor in his royal bed; the whole&#10;court thought he was dead, and every one ran away to pay homage to&#10;his successor. The chamberlains went out to have a talk on the&#10;matter, and the ladies&#39;-maids invited company to take coffee. Cloth&#10;had been laid down on the halls and passages, so that not a&#10;footstep should be heard, and all was silent and still. But the&#10;emperor was not yet dead, although he lay white and stiff on his&#10;gorgeous bed, with the long velvet curtains and heavy gold tassels.&#10;A window stood open, and the moon shone in upon the emperor and the&#10;artificial bird. The poor emperor, finding he could scarcely&#10;breathe with a strange weight on his chest, opened his eyes, and&#10;saw Death sitting there. He had put on the emperor&#39;s golden crown,&#10;and held in one hand his sword of state, and in the other his&#10;beautiful banner. All around the bed and peeping through the long&#10;velvet curtains, were a number of strange heads, some very ugly,&#10;and others lovely and gentle-looking. These were the emperor&#39;s good&#10;and bad deeds, which stared him in the face now Death sat at his&#10;heart.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Do you remember this?&#34; &#34;Do you recollect that?&#34; they&#10;asked one after another, thus bringing to his remembrance&#10;circumstances that made the perspiration stand on his&#10;brow.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I know nothing about it,&#34; said the emperor. &#34;Music!&#10;music!&#34; he cried; &#34;the large Chinese drum! that I may not hear what&#10;they say.&#34; But they still went on, and Death nodded like a Chinaman&#10;to all they said. &#34;Music! music!&#34; shouted the emperor. &#34;You little&#10;precious golden bird, sing, pray sing! I have given you gold and&#10;costly presents; I have even hung my golden slipper round your&#10;neck. Sing! sing!&#34; But the bird remained silent. There was no one&#10;to wind it up, and therefore it could not sing a note.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Death continued to stare at the emperor with his cold,&#10;hollow eyes, and the room was fearfully still. Suddenly there came&#10;through the open window the sound of sweet music. Outside, on the&#10;bough of a tree, sat the living nightingale. She had heard of the&#10;emperor&#39;s illness, and was therefore come to sing to him of hope&#10;and trust. And as she sung, the shadows grew paler and paler; the&#10;blood in the emperor&#39;s veins flowed more rapidly, and gave life to&#10;his weak limbs; and even Death himself listened, and said, &#34;Go on,&#10;little nightingale, go on.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Then will you give me the beautiful golden sword and that&#10;rich banner? and will you give me the emperor&#39;s crown?&#34; said the&#10;bird.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;So Death gave up each of these treasures for a song; and&#10;the nightingale continued her singing. She sung of the quiet&#10;churchyard, where the white roses grow, where the elder-tree wafts&#10;its perfume on the breeze, and the fresh, sweet grass is moistened&#10;by the mourners&#39; tears. Then Death longed to go and see his garden,&#10;and floated out through the window in the form of a cold, white&#10;mist.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Thanks, thanks, you heavenly little bird. I know you&#10;well. I banished you from my kingdom once, and yet you have charmed&#10;away the evil faces from my bed, and banished Death from my heart,&#10;with your sweet song. How can I reward you?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You have already rewarded me,&#34; said the nightingale. &#34;I&#10;shall never forget that I drew tears from your eyes the first time&#10;I sang to you. These are the jewels that rejoice a singer&#39;s heart.&#10;But now sleep, and grow strong and well again. I will sing to you&#10;again.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And as she sung, the emperor fell into a sweet sleep; and&#10;how mild and refreshing that slumber was! When he awoke,&#10;strengthened and restored, the sun shone brightly through the&#10;window; but not one of his servants had returned&#8212;they all believed&#10;he was dead; only the nightingale still sat beside him, and&#10;sang.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You must always remain with me,&#34; said the emperor. &#34;You&#10;shall sing only when it pleases you; and I will break the&#10;artificial bird into a thousand pieces.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No; do not do that,&#34; replied the nightingale; &#34;the bird&#10;did very well as long as it could. Keep it here still. I cannot&#10;live in the palace, and build my nest; but let me come when I like.&#10;I will sit on a bough outside your window, in the evening, and sing&#10;to you, so that you may be happy, and have thoughts full of joy. I&#10;will sing to you of those who are happy, and those who suffer; of&#10;the good and the evil, who are hidden around you. The little&#10;singing bird flies far from you and your court to the home of the&#10;fisherman and the peasant&#39;s cot.

I cannot sleep alone to-night. It&#10;is a good thing that many of us sit on the roost together.&#34; And&#10;then she told a story that made the feathers on the other hens&#10;bristle up, and the cock&#39;s comb fall. There was no doubt about&#10;it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But we will begin at the beginning, and that is to be&#10;found in a hen-roost in another part of the town. The sun was&#10;setting, and the fowls were flying on to their roost; one hen, with&#10;white feathers and short legs, used to lay her eggs according to&#10;the regulations, and was, as a hen, respectable in every way. As&#10;she was flying upon the roost, she plucked herself with her beak,&#10;and a little feather came out.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;There it goes,&#34; she said; &#34;the more I pluck, the more&#10;beautiful do I get.&#34; She said this merrily, for she was the best of&#10;the hens, and, moreover, as had been said, very respectable. With&#10;that she went to sleep.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was dark all around, and hen sat close to hen, but the&#10;one who sat nearest to her merry neighbour did not sleep. She had&#10;heard and yet not heard, as we are often obliged to do in this&#10;world, in order to live at peace; but she could not keep it from&#10;her neighbour on the other side any longer. &#34;Did you hear what was&#10;said? I mention no names, but there is a hen here who intends to&#10;pluck herself in order to look well. If I were a cock, I should&#10;despise her.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Just over the fowls sat the owl, with father owl and the&#10;little owls. The family has sharp ears, and they all heard every&#10;word that their neighbour had said. They rolled their eyes, and&#10;mother owl, beating her wings, said: &#34;Don&#39;t listen to her! But I&#10;suppose you heard what was said? I heard it with my own ears, and&#10;one has to hear a great deal before they fall off. There is one&#10;among the fowls who has so far forgotten what is becoming to a hen&#10;that she plucks out all her feathers and lets the cock see&#10;it.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Prenez garde aux enfants!&#34; said father owl; &#34;children&#10;should not hear such things.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But I must tell our neighbour owl about it; she is such&#10;an estimable owl to talk to.&#34; And with that she flew&#10;away.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Too-whoo! Too-whoo!&#34; they both hooted into the&#10;neighbour&#39;s dove-cot to the doves inside. &#34;Have you heard? Have you&#10;heard? Too-whoo! There is a hen who has plucked out all her&#10;feathers for the sake of the cock; she will freeze to death, if she&#10;is not frozen already. Too-whoo!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Where? where?&#34; cooed the doves.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;In the neighbour&#39;s yard. I have as good as seen it&#10;myself. It is almost unbecoming to tell the story, but there is no&#10;doubt about it.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Believe every word of what we tell you,&#34; said the doves,&#10;and cooed down into their poultry-yard. &#34;There is a hen&#8212;nay, some&#10;say that there are two&#8212;who have plucked out all their feathers, in&#10;order not to look like the others, and to attract the attention of&#10;the cock. It is a dangerous game, for one can easily catch cold and&#10;die from fever, and both of these are dead already.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Wake up! wake up!&#34; crowed the cock, and flew upon his&#10;board. Sleep was still in his eyes, but yet he crowed out: &#34;Three&#10;hens have died of their unfortunate love for a cock. They had&#10;plucked out all their feathers. It is a horrible story: I will not&#10;keep it to myself, but let it go farther.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Let it go farther,&#34; shrieked the bats, and the hens&#10;clucked and the cocks crowed, &#34;Let it go farther! Let it go&#10;farther!&#34; In this way the story travelled from poultry-yard to&#10;poultry-yard, and at last came back to the place from which it had&#10;really started.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Five hens,&#34; it now ran, &#34;have plucked out all their&#10;feathers to show which of them had grown leanest for love of the&#10;cock, and then they all pecked at each other till the blood ran&#10;down and they fell down dead, to the derision and shame of their&#10;family, and to the great loss of their owner.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The hen who had lost the loose little feather naturally&#10;did not recognise her own story, and being a respectable hen, said:&#10;&#34;I despise those fowls; but there are more of that kind. Such&#10;things ought not to be concealed, and I will do my best to get the&#10;story into the papers, so that it becomes known throughout the&#10;land; the hens have richly deserved it, and their family&#10;too.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It got into the papers, it was printed; and there is no&#10;doubt about it, one little feather may easily grow into five&#10;hens.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)

Here we will put up a&#10;book, there another, and there a third, in a sloping row. Now three&#10;on the other side; so, now we have the side scenes. The old box&#10;that lies yonder may be the back stairs; and we&#39;ll lay the flooring&#10;on top of it. The stage represents a room, as every one may see.&#10;Now we want the actors. Let us see what we can find in the&#10;plaything-box. First the personages, and then we will get the play&#10;ready. One after the other; that will be capital!

There&#39;s nothing in the pockets, and that&#39;s very&#10;interesting, for that&#39;s half of an unfortunate attachment. And here&#10;we have the nut-cracker&#39;s boots, with spurs to them. Row, dow, dow!&#10;how they can stamp and strut! They shall represent the unwelcome&#10;wooer, whom the lady does not like. What kind of a play will you&#10;have now? Shall it be a tragedy, or a domestic drama?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;A domestic drama, please,&#34; said little Anna, &#34;for the&#10;others are so fond of that.

In the meantime, we may take one of the prettiest, for&#10;inside they&#39;re all very much alike. Now I shake the pen!&#10;Cock-a-lorum! So now, here&#39;s the play, brin-bran-span new! Now&#10;listen to the play-bill.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And grandpapa took a newspaper, and read as if he were&#10;reading from it:&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&#62;&#60;span&#62;THE PIPE-HEAD AND THE GOOD&#10;HEAD&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&#62;&#60;span&#62;A Family Drama in One&#10;Act&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&#62;&#60;span&#62;CHARACTERS&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&#62;&#60;span&#62;MR.

The Waistcoat has a&#10;laydown collar, and is very modest; but he knows his own value, and&#10;has quite a right to say what he says:&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;I haven&#39;t a spot on me! Goodness of material ought to be&#10;appreciated.

Just look at little&#10;Miss Glove, how she&#39;s pointing her fingers!&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;Could I but have my love,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Who then so happy as Glove!&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Ah!&#60;br /&#62;&#10;If I from him must part,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;I&#39;m sure &#39;twill break my heart!&#39;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#39;Bah!&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The last word was spoken by Mr. Pipe-head; and now it&#39;s&#10;Mr. Waistcoat&#39;s turn:&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;O Glove, my own dear,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Though it cost thee a tear,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Thou must be mine,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;For Holger Danske has sworn it!&#39;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Mr. de Boots, hearing this, kicks up, jingles his spurs,&#10;and knocks down three of the side-scenes.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That&#39;s exceedingly charming!&#34; cried little&#10;Anna.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Silence! silence!&#34; said grandpapa. &#34;Silent approbation&#10;will show that you are the educated public in the stalls. Now Miss&#10;Glove sings her great song with startling effects:&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;I can&#39;t see, heigho!&#60;br /&#62;&#10;And therefore I&#39;ll crow!&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Kikkeriki, in the lofty hall!&#39;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Now comes the exciting part, little Anna. This is the&#10;most important in all the play. Mr. Waistcoat undoes himself, and&#10;addresses his speech to you, that you may applaud; but leave it&#10;alone,&#8212;that&#39;s considered more genteel.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;I am driven to extremities! Take care of yourself! Now&#10;comes the plot! You are the Pipe-head, and I am the good head&#8212;snap!&#10;there you go!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Do you notice this, little Anna?&#34; asked grandpapa.&#10;&#34;That&#39;s a most charming comedy. Mr. Waistcoat seized the old&#10;Pipe-head and put him in his pocket; there he lies, and the&#10;Waistcoat says:&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;You are in my pocket; you can&#39;t come out till you&#10;promise to unite me to your daughter Glove on the left. I hold out&#10;my right hand.&#39;&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That&#39;s awfully pretty,&#34; said little Anna.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And now the old Pipe-head replies:&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;Though I&#39;m all ear,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Very stupid I appear:&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Where&#39;s my humor?

Now the lovers kneel down, and one of them&#10;sings:&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;Father!&#39;&#38;#160; and the other,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#39;Come, do as you ought to do,-&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Bless your son and daughter.&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And they receive his blessing, and celebrate their&#10;wedding, and all the pieces of furniture sing in&#10;chorus,&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;Klink! clanks!&#60;br /&#62;&#10;A thousand thanks;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;And now the play is over!&#39;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And now we&#39;ll applaud,&#34; said grandpapa. &#34;We&#39;ll call them&#10;all out, and the pieces of furniture too, for they are of&#10;mahogany.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And is not our play just as good as those which the&#10;others have in the real theatre?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Our play is much better,&#34; said grandpapa. &#34;It is shorter,&#10;the performers are natural, and it has passed away the interval&#10;before tea-time.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Old Bachelor&#39;s Nightcap'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;THERE is a street in Copenhagen with a very strange name.&#10;It is called &#34;Hysken&#34; street. Where the name came from, and what it&#10;means is very uncertain. It is said to be German, but that is&#10;unjust to the Germans, for it would then be called &#34;Hauschen,&#34; not&#10;&#34;Hysken.&#34; &#34;Hauschen,&#34; means a little house; and for many years it&#10;consisted only of a few small houses, which were scarcely larger&#10;than the wooden booths we see in the market-places at fair time.&#10;They were perhaps a little higher, and had windows; but the panes&#10;consisted of horn or bladder-skins, for glass was then too dear to&#10;have glazed windows in every house. This was a long time ago, so&#10;long indeed that our grandfathers, and even great-grandfathers,&#10;would speak of those days as &#34;olden times;&#34; indeed, many centuries&#10;have passed since then.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The rich merchants in Bremen and Lubeck, who carried on&#10;trade in Copenhagen, did not reside in the town themselves, but&#10;sent their clerks, who dwelt in the wooden booths in the Hauschen&#10;street, and sold beer and spices. The German beer was very good,&#10;and there were many sorts&#8212;from Bremen, Prussia, and Brunswick&#8212;and&#10;quantities of all sorts of spices, saffron, aniseed, ginger, and&#10;especially pepper; indeed, pepper was almost the chief article sold&#10;here; so it happened at last that the German clerks in Denmark got&#10;their nickname of &#34;pepper gentry.&#34; It had been made a condition&#10;with these clerks that they should not marry; so that those who&#10;lived to be old had to take care of themselves, to attend to their&#10;own comforts, and even to light their own fires, when they had any&#10;to light. Many of them were very aged; lonely old boys, with&#10;strange thoughts and eccentric habits. From this, all unmarried&#10;men, who have attained a certain age, are called, in Denmark,&#10;&#34;pepper gentry;&#34; and this must be remembered by all those who wish&#10;to understand the story. These &#34;pepper gentlemen,&#34; or, as they are&#10;called in England, &#34;old bachelors,&#34; are often made a butt of&#10;ridicule; they are told to put on their nightcaps, draw them over&#10;their eyes, and go to sleep. The boys in Denmark make a song of it,&#10;thus:&#8212;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Poor old bachelor, cut your wood,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Such a nightcap was never seen;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Who would think it was ever clean?&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Go to sleep, it will do you good.&#34;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;So they sing about the &#34;pepper gentleman;&#34; so do they make&#10;sport of the poor old bachelor and his nightcap, and all because&#10;they really know nothing of either. It is a cap that no one need&#10;wish for, or laugh at. And why not? Well, we shall hear in the&#10;story.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In olden times, Hauschen Street was not paved, and&#10;passengers would stumble out of one hole into another, as they&#10;generally do in unfrequented highways; and the street was so&#10;narrow, and the booths leaning against each other were so close&#10;together, that in the summer time a sail would be stretched across&#10;the street from one booth to another opposite. At these times the&#10;odor of the pepper, saffron, and ginger became more powerful than&#10;ever. Behind the counter, as a rule, there were no young men. The&#10;clerks were almost all old boys; but they did not dress as we are&#10;accustomed to see old men represented, wearing wigs, nightcaps, and&#10;knee-breeches, and with coat and waistcoat buttoned up to the chin.&#10;We have seen the portraits of our great-grandfathers dressed in&#10;this way; but the &#34;pepper gentlemen&#34; had no money to spare to have&#10;their portraits taken, though one of them would have made a very&#10;interesting picture for us now, if taken as he appeared standing&#10;behind his counter, or going to church, or on holidays. On these&#10;occasions, they wore high-crowned, broad-brimmed hats, and&#10;sometimes a younger clerk would stick a feather in his. The woollen&#10;shirt was concealed by a broad, linen collar; the close jacket was&#10;buttoned up to the chin, and the cloak hung loosely over it; the&#10;trousers were tucked into the broad, tipped shoes, for the clerks&#10;wore no stockings. They generally stuck a table-knife and spoon in&#10;their girdles, as well as a larger knife, as a protection to&#10;themselves; and such a weapon was often very necessary.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;After this fashion was Anthony dressed on holidays and&#10;festivals, excepting that, instead of a high-crowned hat, he wore a&#10;kind of bonnet, and under it a knitted cap, a regular nightcap, to&#10;which he was so accustomed that it was always on his head; he had&#10;two, nightcaps I mean, not heads. Anthony was one of the oldest of&#10;the clerks, and just the subject for a painter. He was as thin as a&#10;lath, wrinkled round the mouth and eyes, had long, bony fingers,&#10;bushy, gray eyebrows, and over his left eye hung a thick tuft of&#10;hair, which did not look handsome, but made his appearance very&#10;remarkable. People knew that he came from Bremen; it was not&#10;exactly his home, although his master resided there. His ancestors&#10;were from Thuringia, and had lived in the town of Eisenach, close&#10;by Wartburg. Old Anthony seldom spoke of this place, but he thought&#10;of it all the more.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The old clerks of Hauschen Street very seldom met&#10;together; each one remained in his own booth, which was closed&#10;early enough in the evening, and then it looked dark and dismal out&#10;in the street. Only a faint glimmer of light struggled through the&#10;horn panes in the little window on the roof, while within sat the&#10;old clerk, generally on his bed, singing his evening hymn in a low&#10;voice; or he would be moving about in his booth till late in the&#10;night, busily employed in many things. It certainly was not a very&#10;lively existence. To be a stranger in a strange land is a bitter&#10;lot; no one notices you unless you happen to stand in their way.&#10;Often, when it was dark night outside, with rain or snow falling,&#10;the place looked quite deserted and gloomy. There were no lamps in&#10;the street, excepting a very small one, which hung at one end of&#10;the street, before a picture of the Virgin, which had been painted&#10;on the wall. The dashing of the water against the bulwarks of a&#10;neighboring castle could plainly be heard. Such evenings are long&#10;and dreary, unless people can find something to do; and so Anthony&#10;found it. There were not always things to be packed or unpacked,&#10;nor paper bags to be made, nor the scales to be polished. So&#10;Anthony invented employment; he mended his clothes and patched his&#10;boots, and when he at last went to bed,&#8212;his nightcap, which he had&#10;worn from habit, still remained on his head; he had only to pull it&#10;down a little farther over his forehead. Very soon, however, it&#10;would be pushed up again to see if the light was properly put out;&#10;he would touch it, press the wick together, and at last pull his&#10;nightcap over his eyes and lie down again on the other side. But&#10;often there would arise in his mind a doubt as to whether every&#10;coal had been quite put out in the little fire-pan in the shop&#10;below. If even a tiny spark had remained it might set fire to&#10;something, and cause great damage. Then he would rise from his bed,&#10;creep down the ladder&#8212;for it could scarcely be called a flight of&#10;stairs&#8212;and when he reached the fire-pan not a spark could be seen;&#10;so he had just to go back again to bed. But often, when he had got&#10;half way back, he would fancy the iron shutters of the door were&#10;not properly fastened, and his thin legs would carry him down&#10;again. And when at last he crept into bed, he would be so cold that&#10;his teeth chattered in his head. He would draw the coverlet closer&#10;round him, pull his nightcap over his eyes, and try to turn his&#10;thoughts from trade, and from the labors of the day, to olden&#10;times. But this was scarcely an agreeable entertainment; for&#10;thoughts of olden memories raise the curtains from the past, and&#10;sometimes pierce the heart with painful recollections till the&#10;agony brings tears to the waking eyes. And so it was with Anthony;&#10;often the scalding tears, like pearly drops, would fall from his&#10;eyes to the coverlet and roll on the floor with a sound as if one&#10;of his heartstrings had broken. Sometimes, with a lurid flame,&#10;memory would light up a picture of life which had never faded from&#10;his heart. If he dried his eyes with his nightcap, then the tear&#10;and the picture would be crushed; but the source of the tears&#10;remained and welled up again in his heart. The pictures did not&#10;follow one another in order, as the circumstances they represented&#10;had occurred; very often the most painful would come together, and&#10;when those came which were most full of joy, they had always the&#10;deepest shadow thrown upon them.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The beech woods of Denmark are acknowledged by every one&#10;to be very beautiful, but more beautiful still in the eyes of old&#10;Anthony were the beech woods in the neighborhood of Wartburg. More&#10;grand and venerable to him seemed the old oaks around the proud&#10;baronial castle, where the creeping plants hung over the stony&#10;summits of the rocks; sweeter was the perfume there of the&#10;apple-blossom than in all the land of Denmark. How vividly were&#10;represented to him, in a glittering tear that rolled down his&#10;cheek, two children at play&#8212;a boy and a girl. The boy had rosy&#10;cheeks, golden ringlets, and clear, blue eyes; he was the son of&#10;Anthony, a rich merchant; it was himself. The little girl had brown&#10;eyes and black hair, and was clever and courageous; she was the&#10;mayor&#39;s daughter, Molly. The children were playing with an apple;&#10;they shook the apple, and heard the pips rattling in it. Then they&#10;cut it in two, and each of them took half. They also divided the&#10;pips and ate all but one, which the little girl proposed should be&#10;placed in the ground.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You will see what will come out,&#34; she said; &#34;something&#10;you don&#39;t expect. A whole apple-tree will come out, but not&#10;directly.&#34; Then they got a flower-pot, filled it with earth, and&#10;were soon both very busy and eager about it. The boy made a hole in&#10;the earth with his finger, and the little girl placed the pip in&#10;the hole, and then they both covered it over with earth.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Now you must not take it out to-morrow to see if it has&#10;taken root,&#34; said Molly; &#34;no one ever should do that. I did so with&#10;my flowers, but only twice; I wanted to see if they were growing. I&#10;didn&#39;t know any better then, and the flowers all died.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Little Anthony kept the flower-pot, and every morning&#10;during the whole winter he looked at it, but there was nothing to&#10;be seen but black earth. At last, however, the spring came, and the&#10;sun shone warm again, and then two little green leaves sprouted&#10;forth in the pot.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;They are Molly and me,&#34; said the boy. &#34;How wonderful they&#10;are, and so beautiful!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Very soon a third leaf made its appearance.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Who does that stand for?&#34; thought he, and then came&#10;another and another. Day after day, and week after week, till the&#10;plant became quite a tree. And all this about the two children was&#10;mirrored to old Anthony in a single tear, which could soon be wiped&#10;away and disappear, but might come again from its source in the&#10;heart of the old man.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the neighborhood of Eisenach stretches a ridge of stony&#10;mountains, one of which has a rounded outline, and shows itself&#10;above the rest without tree, bush, or grass on its barren summits.&#10;It is called the &#34;Venus Mountain,&#34; and the story goes that the&#10;&#34;Lady Venus,&#34; one of the heathen goddesses, keeps house there. She&#10;is also called &#34;Lady Halle,&#34; as every child round Eisenach well&#10;knows. She it was who enticed the noble knight, Tannhauser, the&#10;minstrel, from the circle of singers at Wartburg into her&#10;mountain.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Little Molly and Anthony often stood by this mountain, and&#10;one day Molly said, &#34;Do you dare to knock and say, &#39;Lady Halle,&#10;Lady Halle, open the door: Tannhauser is here!&#39;&#34; But Anthony did&#10;not dare. Molly, however, did, though she only said the words,&#10;&#34;Lady Halle, Lady Halle,&#34; loudly and distinctly; the rest she&#10;muttered so much under her breath that Anthony felt certain she had&#10;really said nothing; and yet she looked quite bold and saucy, just&#10;as she did sometimes when she was in the garden with a number of&#10;other little girls; they would all stand round him together, and&#10;want to kiss him, because he did not like to be kissed, and pushed&#10;them away. Then Molly was the only one who dared to resist him. &#34;I&#10;may kiss him,&#34; she would say proudly, as she threw her arms round&#10;his neck; she was vain of her power over Anthony, for he would&#10;submit quietly and think nothing of it. Molly was very charming,&#10;but rather bold; and how she did tease!&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;They said Lady Halle was beautiful, but her beauty was&#10;that of a tempting fiend. Saint Elizabeth, the tutelar saint of the&#10;land, the pious princess of Thuringia, whose good deeds have been&#10;immortalized in so many places through stories and legends, had&#10;greater beauty and more real grace. Her picture hung in the chapel,&#10;surrounded by silver lamps; but it did not in the least resemble&#10;Molly.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The apple-tree, which the two children had planted, grew&#10;year after year, till it became so large that it had to be&#10;transplanted into the garden, where the dew fell and the sun shone&#10;warmly. And there it increased in strength so much as to be able to&#10;withstand the cold of winter; and after passing through the severe&#10;weather, it seemed to put forth its blossoms in spring for very joy&#10;that the cold season had gone. In autumn it produced two apples,&#10;one for Molly and one for Anthony; it could not well do less. The&#10;tree after this grew very rapidly, and Molly grew with the tree.&#10;She was as fresh as an apple-blossom, but Anthony was not to behold&#10;this flower for long. All things change; Molly&#39;s father left his&#10;old home, and Molly went with him far away. In our time, it would&#10;be only a journey of a few hours, but then it took more than a day&#10;and a night to travel so far eastward from Eisenbach to a town&#10;still called Weimar, on the borders of Thuringia. And Molly and&#10;Anthony both wept, but these tears all flowed together into one&#10;tear which had the rosy shimmer of joy. Molly had told him that she&#10;loved him&#8212;loved him more than all the splendors of&#10;Weimar.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;One, two, three years went by, and during the whole time&#10;he received only two letters. One came by the carrier, and the&#10;other a traveller brought. The way was very long and difficult,&#10;with many turnings and windings through towns and villages. How&#10;often had Anthony and Molly heard the story of Tristan and Isolda,&#10;and Anthony had thought the story applied to him, although Tristan&#10;means born in sorrow, which Anthony certainly was not; nor was it&#10;likely he would ever say of Molly as Tristan said of Isolda, &#34;She&#10;has forgotten me.&#34; But in truth, Isolda had not forgotten him, her&#10;faithful friend; and when both were laid in their graves, one, on&#10;each side of the church, the linden-trees that grew by each grave&#10;spread over the roof, and, bending towards each other, mingled&#10;their blossoms together. Anthony thought it a very beautiful but&#10;mournful story; yet he never feared anything so sad would happen to&#10;him and Molly, as he passed the spot, whistling the air of a song,&#10;composed by the minstrel Walter, called the &#34;Willow bird,&#34;&#10;beginning&#8212;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Under the linden-trees,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Out on the heath.&#34;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;One stanza pleased him exceedingly&#8212;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Through the forest, and in the vale,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Sweetly warbles the nightingale.&#34;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;This song was often in his mouth, and he sung or whistled&#10;it on a moonlight night, when he rode on horseback along the deep,&#10;hollow way, on his road to Weimar, to visit Molly. He wished to&#10;arrive unexpectedly, and so indeed he did. He was received with a&#10;hearty welcome, and introduced to plenty of grand and pleasant&#10;company, where overflowing winecups were passed about. A pretty&#10;room and a good bed were provided for him, and yet his reception&#10;was not what he had expected and dreamed it would be. He could not&#10;comprehend his own feelings nor the feelings of others; but it is&#10;easily understood how a person can be admitted into a house or a&#10;family without becoming one of them. We converse in company with&#10;those we meet, as we converse with our fellow-travellers in a&#10;stage-coach, on a journey; we know nothing of them, and perhaps all&#10;the while we are incommoding one another, and each is wishing&#10;himself or his neighbor away. Something of this kind Anthony felt&#10;when Molly talked to him of old times.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I am a straightforward girl,&#34; she said, &#34;and I will tell&#10;you myself how it is. There have been great changes since we were&#10;children together; everything is different, both inwardly and&#10;outwardly. We cannot control our wills, nor the feelings of our&#10;hearts, by the force of custom. Anthony, I would not, for the&#10;world, make an enemy of you when I am far away. Believe me, I&#10;entertain for you the kindest wishes in my heart; but to feel for&#10;you what I now know can be felt for another man, can never be. You&#10;must try and reconcile yourself to this. Farewell,&#10;Anthony.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Anthony also said, &#34;Farewell.&#34; Not a tear came into his&#10;eye; he felt he was no longer Molly&#39;s friend. Hot iron and cold&#10;iron alike take the skin from our lips, and we feel the same&#10;sensation if we kiss either; and Anthony&#39;s kiss was now the kiss of&#10;hatred, as it had once been the kiss of love. Within&#10;four-and-twenty hours Anthony was back again to Eisenach, though&#10;the horse that he rode was entirely ruined.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What matters it?&#34; said he; &#34;I am ruined also. I will&#10;destroy everything that can remind me of her, or of Lady Halle, or&#10;Lady Venus, the heathen woman. I will break down the apple-tree,&#10;and tear it up by the roots; never more shall it blossom or bear&#10;fruit.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The apple-tree was not broken down; for Anthony himself&#10;was struck with a fever, which caused him to break down, and&#10;confined him to his bed. But something occurred to raise him up&#10;again. What was it? A medicine was offered to him, which he was&#10;obliged to take: a bitter remedy, at which the sick body and the&#10;oppressed spirit alike shuddered. Anthony&#39;s father lost all his&#10;property, and, from being known as one of the richest merchants, he&#10;became very poor. Dark days, heavy trials, with poverty at the&#10;door, came rolling into the house upon them like the waves of the&#10;sea. Sorrow and suffering deprived Anthony&#39;s father of his&#10;strength, so that he had something else to think of besides nursing&#10;his love-sorrows and his anger against Molly. He had to take his&#10;father&#39;s place, to give orders, to act with energy, to help, and,&#10;at last, to go out into the world and earn his bread. Anthony went&#10;to Bremen, and there he learnt what poverty and hard living really&#10;were. These things often harden the character, but sometimes soften&#10;the heart, even too much.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;How different the world, and the people in it, appeared to&#10;Anthony now, to what he had thought in his childhood! What to him&#10;were the minstrel&#39;s songs? An echo of the past, sounds long&#10;vanished. At times he would think in this way; yet again and again&#10;the songs would sound in his soul, and his heart become gentle and&#10;pious.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;God&#39;s will is the best,&#34; he would then say. &#34;It was well&#10;that I was not allowed to keep my power over Molly&#39;s heart, and&#10;that she did not remain true to me. How I should have felt it now,&#10;when fortune has deserted me! She left me before she knew of the&#10;change in my circumstances, or had a thought of what was before me.&#10;That is a merciful providence for me. All has happened for the&#10;best. She could not help it, and yet I have been so bitter, and in&#10;such enmity against her.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Years passed by: Anthony&#39;s father died, and strangers&#10;lived in the old house. He had seen it once again since then. His&#10;rich master sent him journeys on business, and on one occasion his&#10;way led him to his native town of Eisenach. The old Wartburg castle&#10;stood unchanged on the rock where the monk and the nun were hewn&#10;out of the stone. The great oaks formed an outline to the scene&#10;which he so well remembered in his childhood. The Venus mountain&#10;stood out gray and bare, overshadowing the valley beneath. He would&#10;have been glad to call out &#34;Lady Halle, Lady Halle, unlock the&#10;mountain. I would fain remain here always in my native soil.&#34; That&#10;was a sinful thought, and he offered a prayer to drive it away.&#10;Then a little bird in the thicket sang out clearly, and old Anthony&#10;thought of the minstrel&#39;s song. How much came back to his&#10;remembrance as he looked through the tears once more on his native&#10;town! The old house was still standing as in olden times, but the&#10;garden had been greatly altered; a pathway led through a portion of&#10;the ground, and outside the garden, and beyond the path, stood the&#10;old apple-tree, which he had not broken down, although he talked of&#10;doing so in his trouble. The sun still threw its rays upon the&#10;tree, and the refreshing dew fell upon it as of old; and it was so&#10;overloaded with fruit that the branches bent towards the earth with&#10;the weight. &#34;That flourishes still,&#34; said he, as he gazed. One of&#10;the branches of the tree had, however, been broken: mischievous&#10;hands must have done this in passing, for the tree now stood in a&#10;public thoroughfare. &#34;The blossoms are often plucked,&#34; said&#10;Anthony; &#34;the fruit is stolen and the branches broken without a&#10;thankful thought of their profusion and beauty. It might be said of&#10;a tree, as it has been said of some men&#8212;it was not predicted at his&#10;cradle that he should come to this. How brightly began the history&#10;of this tree, and what is it now? Forsaken and forgotten, in a&#10;garden by a hedge in a field, and close to a public road. There it&#10;stands, unsheltered, plundered, and broken. It certainly has not&#10;yet withered; but in the course of years the number of blossoms&#10;from time to time will grow less, and at last it was cease&#10;altogether to bear fruit; and then its history will be&#10;over.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Such were Anthony&#39;s thoughts as he stood under the tree,&#10;and during many a long night as he lay in his lonely chamber in the&#10;wooden house in Hauschen Street, Copenhagen, in the foreign land to&#10;which the rich merchant of Bremen, his employer, had sent him on&#10;condition that he should never marry. &#34;Marry! ha, ha!&#34; and he&#10;laughed bitterly to himself at the thought.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Winter one year set in early, and it was freezing hard.&#10;Without, a snowstorm made every one remain at home who could do so.&#10;Thus it happened that Anthony&#39;s neighbors, who lived opposite to&#10;him, did not notice that his house remained unopened for two days,&#10;and that he had not showed himself during that time, for who would&#10;go out in such weather unless he were obliged to do so. They were&#10;gray, gloomy days, and in the house whose windows were not glass,&#10;twilight and dark nights reigned in turns. During these two days&#10;old Anthony had not left his bed, he had not the strength to do so.&#10;The bitter weather had for some time affected his limbs. There lay&#10;the old bachelor, forsaken by all, and unable to help himself. He&#10;could scarcely reach the water jug that he had placed by his bed,&#10;and the last drop was gone. It was not fever, nor sickness, but old&#10;age, that had laid him low. In the little corner, where his bed&#10;lay, he was over-shadowed as it were by perpetual night. A little&#10;spider, which he could however not see, busily and cheerfully spun&#10;its web above him, so that there should be a kind of little banner&#10;waving over the old man, when his eyes closed. The time passed&#10;slowly and painfully. He had no tears to shed, and he felt no pain;&#10;no thought of Molly came into his mind. He felt as if the world was&#10;now nothing to him, as if he were lying beyond it, with no one to&#10;think of him. Now and then he felt slight sensations of hunger and&#10;thirst; but no one came to him, no one tended him. He thought of&#10;all those who had once suffered from starvation, of Saint&#10;Elizabeth, who once wandered on the earth, the saint of his home&#10;and his childhood, the noble Duchess of Thuringia, that highly&#10;esteemed lady who visited the poorest villages, bringing hope and&#10;relief to the sick inmates. The recollection of her pious deeds was&#10;as light to the soul of poor Anthony. He thought of her as she went&#10;about speaking words of comfort, binding up the wounds of the&#10;afflicted and feeding the hungry, although often blamed for it by&#10;her stern husband. He remembered a story told of her, that on one&#10;occasion, when she was carrying a basket full of wine and&#10;provisions, her husband, who had watched her footsteps, stepped&#10;forward and asked her angrily what she carried in her basket,&#10;whereupon, with fear and trembling, she answered, &#34;Roses, which I&#10;have plucked from the garden.&#34; Then he tore away the cloth which&#10;covered the basket, and what could equal the surprise of the pious&#10;woman, to find that by a miracle, everything in her basket&#8212;the&#10;wine, the bread&#8212;had all been changed into roses.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In this way the memory of the kind lady dwelt in the calm&#10;mind of Anthony. She was as a living reality in his little dwelling&#10;in the Danish land. He uncovered his face that he might look into&#10;her gentle eyes, while everything around him changed from its look&#10;of poverty and want, to a bright rose tint. The fragrance of roses&#10;spread through the room, mingled with the sweet smell of apples. He&#10;saw the branches of an apple-tree spreading above him. It was the&#10;tree which he and Molly had planted together. The fragrant leaves&#10;of the tree fell upon him and cooled his burning brow; upon his&#10;parched lips they seemed like refreshing bread and wine; and as&#10;they rested on his breast, a peaceful calm stole over him, and he&#10;felt inclined to sleep. &#34;I shall sleep now,&#34; he whispered to&#10;himself. &#34;Sleep will do me good. In the morning I shall be upon my&#10;feet again, strong and well. Glorious! wonderful! That apple-tree,&#10;planted in love, now appears before me in heavenly beauty.&#34; And he&#10;slept.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The following day, the third day during which his house&#10;had been closed, the snow-storm ceased. Then his opposite neighbor&#10;stepped over to the house in which old Anthony lived, for he had&#10;not yet showed himself. There he lay stretched on his bed, dead,&#10;with his old nightcap tightly clasped in his two hands. The&#10;nightcap, however, was not placed on his head in his coffin; he had&#10;a clean white one on then. Where now were the tears he had shed?&#10;What had become of those wonderful pearls? They were in the&#10;nightcap still. Such tears as these cannot be washed out, even when&#10;the nightcap is forgotten. The old thoughts and dreams of a&#10;bachelor&#39;s nightcap still remain. Never wish for such a nightcap.&#10;It would make your forehead hot, cause your pulse to beat with&#10;agitation, and conjure up dreams which would appear&#10;realities.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The first who wore old Anthony&#39;s cap felt the truth of&#10;this, though it was half a century afterwards. That man was the&#10;mayor himself, who had already made a comfortable home for his wife&#10;and eleven children, by his industry. The moment he put the cap on&#10;he dreamed of unfortunate love, of bankruptcy, and of dark days.&#10;&#34;Hallo! how the nightcap burns!&#34; he exclaimed, as he tore it from&#10;his bead. Then a pearl rolled out, and then another, and another,&#10;and they glittered and sounded as they fell. &#34;What can this be? Is&#10;it paralysis, or something dazzling my eyes?&#34; They were the tears&#10;which old Anthony had shed half a century before.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;To every one who afterwards put this cap on his head, came&#10;visions and dreams which agitated him not a little. His own history&#10;was changed into that of Anthony till it became quite a story, and&#10;many stories might be made by others, so we will leave them to&#10;relate their own. We have told the first; and our last word is,&#10;don&#39;t wish for a &#34;bachelor&#39;s nightcap.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Old Church Bell'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;(WRITTEN FOR THE SCHILLER ALBUM)&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;IN the country of Wurtemburg, in Germany, where the&#10;acacias grow by the public road, where the apple-trees and the&#10;pear-trees in autumn bend to the earth with the weight of the&#10;precious fruit, lies the little town of Marbach. As is often the&#10;case with many of these towns, it is charmingly situated on the&#10;banks of the river Neckar, which rushes rapidly by, passing&#10;villages, old knights&#39; castles, and green vineyards, till its&#10;waters mingle with those of the stately Rhine. It was late in the&#10;autumn; the vine-leaves still hung upon the branches of the vines,&#10;but they were already tinted with red and gold; heavy showers fell&#10;on the surrounding country, and the cold autumn wind blew sharp and&#10;strong. It was not at all pleasant weather for the poor. The days&#10;grew shorter and more gloomy, and, dark as it was out of doors in&#10;the open air, it was still darker within the small, old-fashioned&#10;houses of the village. The gable end of one of these houses faced&#10;the street, and with its small, narrow windows, presented a very&#10;mean appearance. The family who dwelt in it were also very poor and&#10;humble, but they treasured the fear of God in their innermost&#10;hearts. And now He was about to send them a child. It was the hour&#10;of the mother&#39;s sorrow, when there pealed forth from the church&#10;tower the sound of festive bells. In that solemn hour the sweet and&#10;joyous chiming filled the hearts of those in the humble dwelling&#10;with thankfulness and trust; and when, amidst these joyous sounds,&#10;a little son was born to them, the words of prayer and praise arose&#10;from their overflowing hearts, and their happiness seemed to ring&#10;out over town and country in the liquid tones of the church bells&#39;&#10;chime. The little one, with its bright eyes and golden hair, had&#10;been welcomed joyously on that dark November day. Its parents&#10;kissed it lovingly, and the father wrote these words in the Bible,&#10;&#34;On the tenth of November, 1759, God sent us a son.&#34; And a short&#10;time after, when the child had been baptized, the names he had&#10;received were added, &#34;John Christopher Frederick.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And what became of the little lad?&#8212;the poor boy of the&#10;humble town of Marbach? Ah, indeed, there was no one who thought or&#10;supposed, not even the old church bell which had been the first to&#10;sound and chime for him, that he would be the first to sing the&#10;beautiful song of &#34;The Bell.&#34; The boy grew apace, and the world&#10;advanced with him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;While he was yet a child, his parents removed from&#10;Marbach, and went to reside in another town; but their dearest&#10;friends remained behind at Marbach, and therefore sometimes the&#10;mother and her son would start on a fine day to pay a visit to the&#10;little town. The boy was at this time about six years old, and&#10;already knew a great many stories out of the Bible, and several&#10;religious psalms. While seated in the evening on his little&#10;cane-chair, he had often heard his father read from Gellert&#39;s&#10;fables, and sometimes from Klopstock&#39;s grand poem, &#34;The Messiah.&#34;&#10;He and his sister, two years older than himself, had often wept&#10;scalding tears over the story of Him who suffered death on the&#10;cross for us all.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;On his first visit to Marbach, the town appeared to have&#10;changed but very little, and it was not far enough away to be&#10;forgotten. The house, with its pointed gable, narrow windows,&#10;overhanging walls and stories, projecting one beyond another,&#10;looked just the same as in former times. But in the churchyard&#10;there were several new graves; and there also, in the grass, close&#10;by the wall, stood the old church bell! It had been taken down from&#10;its high position, in consequence of a crack in the metal which&#10;prevented it from ever chiming again, and a new bell now occupied&#10;its place. The mother and son were walking in the churchyard when&#10;they discovered the old bell, and they stood still to look at it.&#10;Then the mother reminded her little boy of what a useful bell this&#10;had been for many hundred years. It had chimed for weddings and for&#10;christenings; it had tolled for funerals, and to give the alarm in&#10;case of fire. With every event in the life of man the bell had made&#10;its voice heard. His mother also told him how the chiming of that&#10;old bell had once filled her heart with joy and confidence, and&#10;that in the midst of the sweet tones her child had been given to&#10;her. And the boy gazed on the large, old bell with the deepest&#10;interest. He bowed his head over it and kissed it, old, thrown&#10;away, and cracked as it was, and standing there amidst the grass&#10;and nettles. The boy never forgot what his mother told him, and the&#10;tones of the old bell reverberated in his heart till he reached&#10;manhood. In such sweet remembrance was the old bell cherished by&#10;the boy, who grew up in poverty to be tall and slender, with a&#10;freckled complexion and hair almost red; but his eyes were clear&#10;and blue as the deep sea, and what was his career to be? His career&#10;was to be good, and his future life enviable. We find him taking&#10;high honors at the military school in the division commanded by the&#10;member of a family high in position, and this was an honor, that is&#10;to say, good luck. He wore gaiters, stiff collars, and powdered&#10;hair, and by this he was recognized; and, indeed, he might be known&#10;by the word of command&#8212;&#34;March! halt! front!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The old church bell had long been quite forgotten, and no&#10;one imagined it would ever again be sent to the melting furnace to&#10;make it as it was before. No one could possibly have foretold this.&#10;Equally impossible would it have been to believe that the tones of&#10;the old bell still echoed in the heart of the boy from Marbach; or&#10;that one day they would ring out loud enough and strong enough to&#10;be heard all over the world. They had already been heard in the&#10;narrow space behind the school-wall, even above the deafening&#10;sounds of &#34;March! halt! front!&#34; They had chimed so loudly in the&#10;heart of the youngster, that he had sung them to his companions,&#10;and their tones resounded to the very borders of the country. He&#10;was not a free scholar in the military school, neither was he&#10;provided with clothes or food. But he had his number, and his own&#10;peg; for everything here was ordered like clockwork, which we all&#10;know is of the greatest utility&#8212;people get on so much better&#10;together when their position and duties are understood. It is by&#10;pressure that a jewel is stamped. The pressure of regularity and&#10;discipline here stamped the jewel, which in the future the world so&#10;well knew.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the chief town of the province a great festival was&#10;being celebrated. The light streamed forth from thousands of lamps,&#10;and the rockets shot upwards towards the sky, filling the air with&#10;showers of colored fiery sparks. A record of this bright display&#10;will live in the memory of man, for through it the pupil in the&#10;military school was in tears and sorrow. He had dared to attempt to&#10;reach foreign territories unnoticed, and must therefore give up&#10;fatherland, mother, his dearest friends, all, or sink down into the&#10;stream of common life. The old church bell had still some comfort;&#10;it stood in the shelter of the church wall in Marbach, once so&#10;elevated, now quite forgotten. The wind roared around it, and could&#10;have readily related the story of its origin and of its sweet&#10;chimes, and the wind could also tell of him to whom he had brought&#10;fresh air when, in the woods of a neighboring country, he had sunk&#10;down exhausted with fatigue, with no other worldly possessions than&#10;hope for the future, and a written leaf from &#34;Fiesco.&#34; The wind&#10;could have told that his only protector was an artist, who, by&#10;reading each leaf to him, made it plain; and that they amused&#10;themselves by playing at nine-pins together. The wind could also&#10;describe the pale fugitive, who, for weeks and months, lay in a&#10;wretched little road-side inn, where the landlord got drunk and&#10;raved, and where the merry-makers had it all their own way. And he,&#10;the pale fugitive, sang of the ideal.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;For many heavy days and dark nights the heart must suffer&#10;to enable it to endure trial and temptation; yet, amidst it all,&#10;would the minstrel sing. Dark days and cold nights also passed over&#10;the old bell, and it noticed them not; but the bell in the man&#39;s&#10;heart felt it to be a gloomy time. What would become of this young&#10;man, and what would become of the old bell?&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The old bell was, after a time, carried away to a greater&#10;distance than any one, even the warder in the bell tower, ever&#10;imagined; and the bell in the breast of the young man was heard in&#10;countries where his feet had never wandered. The tones went forth&#10;over the wide ocean to every part of the round world.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;We will now follow the career of the old bell. It was, as&#10;we have said, carried far away from Marbach and sold as old copper;&#10;then sent to Bavaria to be melted down in a furnace. And then what&#10;happened?&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the royal city of Bavaria, many years after the bell&#10;had been removed from the tower and melted down, some metal was&#10;required for a monument in honor of one of the most celebrated&#10;characters which a German people or a German land could produce.&#10;And now we see how wonderfully things are ordered. Strange things&#10;sometimes happen in this world.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In Denmark, in one of those green islands where the&#10;foliage of the beech-woods rustles in the wind, and where many&#10;Huns&#39; graves may be seen, was another poor boy born. He wore wooden&#10;shoes, and when his father worked in a ship-yard, the boy, wrapped&#10;up in an old worn-out shawl, carried his dinner to him every day.&#10;This poor child was now the pride of his country; for the&#10;sculptured marble, the work of his hands, had astonished the&#10;world.&#60;a href=&#34;footnotes.xml#footnote_2&#34; class=&#34;footnote&#34; id=&#34;footnote_2_call&#34;&#62;[2]&#60;/a&#62; &#38;#160;To him was offered the honor of&#10;forming from the clay, a model of the figure of him whose name,&#10;&#34;John Christopher Frederick,&#34; had been written by his father in the&#10;Bible. The bust was cast in bronze, and part of the metal used for&#10;this purpose was the old church bell, whose tones had died away&#10;from the memory of those at home and elsewhere. The metal, glowing&#10;with heat, flowed into the mould, and formed the head and bust of&#10;the statue which was unveiled in the square in front of the old&#10;castle. The statue represented in living, breathing reality, the&#10;form of him who was born in poverty, the boy from Marbach, the&#10;pupil of the military school, the fugitive who struggled against&#10;poverty and oppression, from the outer world; Germany&#39;s great and&#10;immortal poet, who sung of Switzerland&#39;s deliverer, William Tell,&#10;and of the heaven-inspired Maid of Orleans.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was a beautiful sunny day; flags were waving from tower and&#10;roof in royal Stuttgart, and the church bells were ringing a joyous&#10;peal. One bell was silent; but it was illuminated by the bright&#10;sunshine which streamed from the head and bust of the renowned&#10;figure, of which it formed a part. On this day, just one hundred&#10;years had passed since the day on which the chiming of the old&#10;church bell at Marbach had filled the mother&#39;s heart with trust and&#10;joy&#8212;the day on which her child was born in poverty, and in a humble&#10;home; the same who, in after-years, became rich, became the noble&#10;woman-hearted poet, a blessing to the world&#8212;the glorious, the&#10;sublime, the immortal bard, John Christoper Frederick Schiller!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Old Grave-Stone'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;IN a house, with a large courtyard, in a provincial town,&#10;at that time of the year in which people say the evenings are&#10;growing longer, a family circle were gathered together at their old&#10;home. A lamp burned on the table, although the weather was mild and&#10;warm, and the long curtains hung down before the open windows, and&#10;without the moon shone brightly in the dark-blue sky.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But they were not talking of the moon, but of a large, old&#10;stone that lay below in the courtyard not very far from the kitchen&#10;door. The maids often laid the clean copper saucepans and kitchen&#10;vessels on this stone, that they might dry in the sun, and the&#10;children were fond of playing on it. It was, in fact, an old&#10;grave-stone.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes,&#34; said the master of the house, &#34;I believe the stone&#10;came from the graveyard of the old church of the convent which was&#10;pulled down, and the pulpit, the monuments, and the grave-stones&#10;sold. My father bought the latter; most of them were cut in two and&#10;used for paving-stones, but that one stone was preserved whole, and&#10;laid in the courtyard.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Any one can see that it is a grave-stone,&#34; said the&#10;eldest of the children; &#34;the representation of an hour-glass and&#10;part of the figure of an angel can still be traced, but the&#10;inscription beneath is quite worn out, excepting the name &#39;Preben,&#39;&#10;and a large &#39;S&#39; close by it, and a little farther down the name of&#10;&#39;Martha&#39; can be easily read. But nothing more, and even that cannot&#10;be seen unless it has been raining, or when we have washed the&#10;stone.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Dear me! how singular. Why that must be the grave-stone&#10;of Preben Schwane and his wife.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The old man who said this looked old enough to be the&#10;grandfather of all present in the room.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes,&#34; he continued, &#34;these people were among the last who&#10;were buried in the churchyard of the old convent. They were a very&#10;worthy old couple, I can remember them well in the days of my&#10;boyhood. Every one knew them, and they were esteemed by all. They&#10;were the oldest residents in the town, and people said they&#10;possessed a ton of gold, yet they were always very plainly dressed,&#10;in the coarsest stuff, but with linen of the purest whiteness.&#10;Preben and Martha were a fine old couple, and when they both sat on&#10;the bench, at the top of the steep stone steps, in front of their&#10;house, with the branches of the linden-tree waving above them, and&#10;nodded in a gentle, friendly way to passers by, it really made one&#10;feel quite happy. They were very good to the poor; they fed them&#10;and clothed them, and in their benevolence there was judgment as&#10;well as true Christianity. The old woman died first; that day is&#10;still quite vividly before my eyes. I was a little boy, and had&#10;accompanied my father to the old man&#39;s house. Martha had fallen&#10;into the sleep of death just as we arrived there. The corpse lay in&#10;a bedroom, near to the one in which we sat, and the old man was in&#10;great distress and weeping like a child. He spoke to my father, and&#10;to a few neighbors who were there, of how lonely he should feel now&#10;she was gone, and how good and true she, his dead wife, had been&#10;during the number of years that they had passed through life&#10;together, and how they had become acquainted, and learnt to love&#10;each other. I was, as I have said, a boy, and only stood by and&#10;listened to what the others said; but it filled me with a strange&#10;emotion to listen to the old man, and to watch how the color rose&#10;in his cheeks as he spoke of the days of their courtship, of how&#10;beautiful she was, and how many little tricks he had been guilty&#10;of, that he might meet her. And then he talked of his wedding-day;&#10;and his eyes brightened, and he seemed to be carried back, by his&#10;words, to that joyful time. And yet there she was, lying in the&#10;next room, dead&#8212;an old woman, and he was an old man, speaking of&#10;the days of hope, long passed away. Ah, well, so it is; then I was&#10;but a child, and now I am old, as old as Preben Schwane then was.&#10;Time passes away, and all things changed. I can remember quite well&#10;the day on which she was buried, and how Old Preben walked close&#10;behind the coffin.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;A few years before this time the old couple had had their&#10;grave-stone prepared, with an inscription and their names, but not&#10;the date. In the evening the stone was taken to the churchyard, and&#10;laid on the grave. A year later it was taken up, that Old Preben&#10;might be laid by the side of his wife. They did not leave behind&#10;them wealth, they left behind them far less than people had&#10;believed they possessed; what there was went to families distantly&#10;related to them, of whom, till then, no one had ever heard. The old&#10;house, with its balcony of wickerwork, and the bench at the top of&#10;the high steps, under the lime-tree, was considered, by the&#10;road-inspectors, too old and rotten to be left standing.&#10;Afterwards, when the same fate befell the convent church, and the&#10;graveyard was destroyed, the grave-stone of Preben and Martha, like&#10;everything else, was sold to whoever would buy it. And so it&#10;happened that this stone was not cut in two as many others had&#10;been, but now lies in the courtyard below, a scouring block for the&#10;maids, and a playground for the children. The paved street now&#10;passes over the resting place of Old Preben and his wife; no one&#10;thinks of them any more now.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the old man who had spoken of all this shook his head&#10;mournfully, and said, &#34;Forgotten! Ah, yes, everything will be&#10;forgotten!&#34; And then the conversation turned on other&#10;matters.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But the youngest child in the room, a boy, with large,&#10;earnest eyes, mounted upon a chair behind the window curtains, and&#10;looked out into the yard, where the moon was pouring a flood of&#10;light on the old gravestone,&#8212;the stone that had always appeared to&#10;him so dull and flat, but which lay there now like a great leaf out&#10;of a book of history. All that the boy had heard of Old Preben and&#10;his wife seemed clearly defined on the stone, and as he gazed on&#10;it, and glanced at the clear, bright moon shining in the pure air,&#10;it was as if the light of God&#39;s countenance beamed over His&#10;beautiful world.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Forgotten! Everything will be forgotten!&#34; still echoed&#10;through the room, and in the same moment an invisible spirit&#10;whispered to the heart of the boy, &#34;Preserve carefully the seed&#10;that has been entrusted to thee, that it may grow and thrive. Guard&#10;it well. Through thee, my child, shall the obliterated inscription&#10;on the old, weather-beaten grave-stone go forth to future&#10;generations in clear, golden characters. The old pair shall again&#10;wander through the streets arm-in-arm, or sit with their fresh,&#10;healthy cheeks on the bench under the lime-tree, and smile and nod&#10;at rich and poor. The seed of this hour shall ripen in the course&#10;of years into a beautiful poem. The beautiful and the good are&#10;never forgotten, they live always in story or in song.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Old House'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A VERY old house stood once in a street with several that&#10;were quite new and clean. The date of its erection had been carved&#10;on one of the beams, and surrounded by scrolls formed of tulips and&#10;hop-tendrils; by this date it could be seen that the old house was&#10;nearly three hundred years old. Verses too were written over the&#10;windows in old-fashioned letters, and grotesque faces, curiously&#10;carved, grinned at you from under the cornices. One story projected&#10;a long way over the other, and under the roof ran a leaden gutter,&#10;with a dragon&#39;s head at the end. The rain was intended to pour out&#10;at the dragon&#39;s mouth, but it ran out of his body instead, for&#10;there was a hole in the gutter. The other houses in the street were&#10;new and well built, with large window panes and smooth walls. Any&#10;one could see they had nothing to do with the old house. Perhaps&#10;they thought, &#34;How long will that heap of rubbish remain here to be&#10;a disgrace to the whole street. The parapet projects so far forward&#10;that no one can see out of our windows what is going on in that&#10;direction. The stairs are as broad as the staircase of a castle,&#10;and as steep as if they led to a church-tower. The iron railing&#10;looks like the gate of a cemetery, and there are brass knobs upon&#10;it. It is really too ridiculous.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Opposite to the old house were more nice new houses, which&#10;had just the same opinion as their neighbors.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;At the window of one of them sat a little boy with fresh&#10;rosy cheeks, and clear sparkling eyes, who was very fond of the old&#10;house, in sunshine or in moonlight. He would sit and look at the&#10;wall from which the plaster had in some places fallen off, and&#10;fancy all sorts of scenes which had been in former times. How the&#10;street must have looked when the houses had all gable roofs, open&#10;staircases, and gutters with dragons at the spout. He could even&#10;see soldiers walking about with halberds. Certainly it was a very&#10;good house to look at for amusement.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;An old man lived in it, who wore knee-breeches, a coat&#10;with large brass buttons, and a wig, which any one could see was a&#10;real wig. Every morning an old man came to clean the rooms, and to&#10;wait upon him, otherwise the old man in the knee-breeches would&#10;have been quite alone in the house. Sometimes he came to one of the&#10;windows and looked out; then the little boy nodded to him, and the&#10;old man nodded back again, till they became acquainted, and were&#10;friends, although they had never spoken to each other; but that was&#10;of no consequence.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The little boy one day heard his parents say, &#34;The old man&#10;opposite is very well off, but is terribly lonely.&#34; The next Sunday&#10;morning the little boy wrapped something in a piece of paper and&#10;took it to the door of the old house, and said to the attendant who&#10;waited upon the old man, &#34;Will you please give this from me to the&#10;gentleman who lives here; I have two tin soldiers, and this is one&#10;of them, and he shall have it, because I know he is terribly&#10;lonely.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the old attendant nodded and looked very pleased, and&#10;then he carried the tin soldier into the house.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Afterwards he was sent over to ask the little boy if he&#10;would not like to pay a visit himself. His parents gave him&#10;permission, and so it was that he gained admission to the old&#10;house.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The brassy knobs on the railings shone more brightly than&#10;ever, as if they had been polished on account of his visit; and on&#10;the door were carved trumpeters standing in tulips, and it seemed&#10;as if they were blowing with all their might, their cheeks were so&#10;puffed out. &#34;Tanta-ra-ra, the little boy is coming; Tanta-ra-ra,&#10;the little boy is coming.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the door opened. All round the hall hung old&#10;portraits of knights in armor, and ladies in silk gowns; and the&#10;armor rattled, and the silk dresses rustled. Then came a staircase&#10;which went up a long way, and then came down a little way and led&#10;to a balcony, which was in a very ruinous state. There were large&#10;holes and long cracks, out of which grew grass and leaves, indeed&#10;the whole balcony, the courtyard, and the walls were so overgrown&#10;with green that they looked like a garden. In the balcony stood&#10;flower-pots, on which were heads having asses&#39; ears, but the&#10;flowers in them grew just as they pleased. In one pot pinks were&#10;growing all over the sides, at least the green leaves were shooting&#10;forth stalk and stem, and saying as plainly as they could speak,&#10;&#34;The air has fanned me, the sun has kissed me, and I am promised a&#10;little flower for next Sunday&#8212;really for next Sunday.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then they entered a room in which the walls were covered&#10;with leather, and the leather had golden flowers stamped upon&#10;it.&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Gilding will fade in damp weather,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;To endure, there is nothing like leather,&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;said the walls. Chairs handsomely carved, with elbows on&#10;each side, and with very high backs, stood in the room, and as they&#10;creaked they seemed to say, &#34;Sit down. Oh dear, how I am creaking.&#10;I shall certainly have the gout like the old cupboard. Gout in my&#10;back, ugh.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And then the little boy entered the room where the old man&#10;sat.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Thank you for the tin soldier my little friend,&#34; said the&#10;old man, &#34;and thank you also for coming to see me.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Thanks, thanks,&#34; or &#34;Creak, creak,&#34; said all the&#10;furniture.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;There was so much that the pieces of furniture stood in&#10;each other&#39;s way to get a sight of the little boy.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;On the wall near the centre of the room hung the picture&#10;of a beautiful lady, young and gay, dressed in the fashion of the&#10;olden times, with powdered hair, and a full, stiff skirt. She said&#10;neither &#34;thanks&#34; nor &#34;creak,&#34; but she looked down upon the little&#10;boy with her mild eyes; and then he said to the old man,&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Where did you get that picture?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;From the shop opposite,&#34; he replied. &#34;Many portraits hang&#10;there that none seem to trouble themselves about. The persons they&#10;represent have been dead and buried long since. But I knew this&#10;lady many years ago, and she has been dead nearly half a&#10;century.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Under a glass beneath the picture hung a nosegay of&#10;withered flowers, which were no doubt half a century old too, at&#10;least they appeared so.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the pendulum of the old clock went to and fro, and the&#10;hands turned round; and as time passed on, everything in the room&#10;grew older, but no one seemed to notice it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;They say at home,&#34; said the little boy, &#34;that you are&#10;very lonely.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh,&#34; replied the old man, &#34;I have pleasant thoughts of&#10;all that has passed, recalled by memory; and now you are come to&#10;visit me, and that is very pleasant.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then he took from the book-case, a book full of pictures&#10;representing long processions of wonderful coaches, such as are&#10;never seen at the present time. Soldiers like the knave of clubs,&#10;and citizens with waving banners. The tailors had a flag with a&#10;pair of scissors supported by two lions, and on the shoemakers&#39;&#10;flag there were not boots, but an eagle with two heads, for the&#10;shoemakers must have everything arranged so that they can say,&#10;&#34;This is a pair.&#34; What a picture-book it was; and then the old man&#10;went into another room to fetch apples and nuts. It was very&#10;pleasant, certainly, to be in that old house.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I cannot endure it,&#34; said the tin soldier, who stood on a&#10;shelf, &#34;it is so lonely and dull here. I have been accustomed to&#10;live in a family, and I cannot get used to this life. I cannot bear&#10;it. The whole day is long enough, but the evening is longer. It is&#10;not here like it was in your house opposite, when your father and&#10;mother talked so cheerfully together, while you and all the dear&#10;children made such a delightful noise. No, it is all lonely in the&#10;old man&#39;s house. Do you think he gets any kisses? Do you think he&#10;ever has friendly looks, or a Christmas tree? He will have nothing&#10;now but the grave. Oh, I cannot bear it.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You must not look only on the sorrowful side,&#34; said the&#10;little boy; &#34;I think everything in this house is beautiful, and all&#10;the old pleasant thoughts come back here to pay visits.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ah, but I never see any, and I don&#39;t know them,&#34; said the&#10;tin soldier, &#34;and I cannot bear it.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You must bear it,&#34; said the little boy. Then the old man&#10;came back with a pleasant face; and brought with him beautiful&#10;preserved fruits, as well as apples and nuts; and the little boy&#10;thought no more of the tin soldier. How happy and delighted the&#10;little boy was; and after he returned home, and while days and&#10;weeks passed, a great deal of nodding took place from one house to&#10;the other, and then the little boy went to pay another visit. The&#10;carved trumpeters blew &#34;Tanta-ra-ra. There is the little boy.&#10;Tanta-ra-ra.&#34; The swords and armor on the old knight&#39;s pictures&#10;rattled. The silk dresses rustled, the leather repeated its rhyme,&#10;and the old chairs had the gout in their backs, and cried, &#34;Creak;&#34;&#10;it was all exactly like the first time; for in that house, one day&#10;and one hour were just like another. &#34;I cannot bear it any longer,&#34;&#10;said the tin soldier; &#34;I have wept tears of tin, it is so&#10;melancholy here. Let me go to the wars, and lose an arm or a leg,&#10;that would be some change; I cannot bear it. Now I know what it is&#10;to have visits from one&#39;s old recollections, and all they bring&#10;with them. I have had visits from mine, and you may believe me it&#10;is not altogether pleasant. I was very nearly jumping from the&#10;shelf. I saw you all in your house opposite, as if you were really&#10;present. It was Sunday morning, and you children stood round the&#10;table, singing the hymn that you sing every morning. You were&#10;standing quietly, with your hands folded, and your father and&#10;mother. You were standing quietly, with your hands folded, and your&#10;father and mother were looking just as serious, when the door&#10;opened, and your little sister Maria, who is not two years old, was&#10;brought into the room. You know she always dances when she hears&#10;music and singing of any sort; so she began to dance immediately,&#10;although she ought not to have done so, but she could not get into&#10;the right time because the tune was so slow; so she stood first on&#10;one leg and then on the other, and bent her head very low, but it&#10;would not suit the music. You all stood looking very grave,&#10;although it was very difficult to do so, but I laughed so to myself&#10;that I fell down from the table, and got a bruise, which is there&#10;still; I know it was not right to laugh. So all this, and&#10;everything else that I have seen, keeps running in my head, and&#10;these must be the old recollections that bring so many thoughts&#10;with them. Tell me whether you still sing on Sundays, and tell me&#10;about your little sister Maria, and how my old comrade is, the&#10;other tin soldier. Ah, really he must be very happy; I cannot&#10;endure this life.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You are given away,&#34; said the little boy; &#34;you must stay.&#10;Don&#39;t you see that?&#34; Then the old man came in, with a box&#10;containing many curious things to show him. Rouge-pots,&#10;scent-boxes, and old cards, so large and so richly gilded, that&#10;none are ever seen like them in these days. And there were smaller&#10;boxes to look at, and the piano was opened, and inside the lid were&#10;painted landscapes. But when the old man played, the piano sounded&#10;quite out of tune. Then he looked at the picture he had bought at&#10;the broker&#39;s, and his eyes sparkled brightly as he nodded at it,&#10;and said, &#34;Ah, she could sing that tune.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I will go to the wars! I will go to the wars!&#34; cried the&#10;tin soldier as loud as he could, and threw himself down on the&#10;floor. Where could he have fallen? The old man searched, and the&#10;little boy searched, but he was gone, and could not be found. &#34;I&#10;shall find him again,&#34; said the old man, but he did not find him.&#10;The boards of the floor were open and full of holes. The tin&#10;soldier had fallen through a crack between the boards, and lay&#10;there now in an open grave. The day went by, and the little boy&#10;returned home; the week passed, and many more weeks. It was winter,&#10;and the windows were quite frozen, so the little boy was obliged to&#10;breathe on the panes, and rub a hole to peep through at the old&#10;house. Snow drifts were lying in all the scrolls and on the&#10;inscriptions, and the steps were covered with snow as if no one&#10;were at home. And indeed nobody was home, for the old man was dead.&#10;In the evening, a hearse stopped at the door, and the old man in&#10;his coffin was placed in it. He was to be taken to the country to&#10;be buried there in his own grave; so they carried him away; no one&#10;followed him, for all his friends were dead; and the little boy&#10;kissed his hand to the coffin as the hearse moved away with it. A&#10;few days after, there was an auction at the old house, and from his&#10;window the little boy saw the people carrying away the pictures of&#10;old knights and ladies, the flower-pots with the long ears, the old&#10;chairs, and the cup-boards. Some were taken one way, some another.&#10;Her portrait, which had been bought at the picture dealer&#39;s, went&#10;back again to his shop, and there it remained, for no one seemed to&#10;know her, or to care for the old picture. In the spring; they began&#10;to pull the house itself down; people called it complete rubbish.&#10;From the street could be seen the room in which the walls were&#10;covered with leather, ragged and torn, and the green in the balcony&#10;hung straggling over the beams; they pulled it down quickly, for it&#10;looked ready to fall, and at last it was cleared away altogether.&#10;&#34;What a good riddance,&#34; said the neighbors&#39; houses. Very shortly, a&#10;fine new house was built farther back from the road; it had lofty&#10;windows and smooth walls, but in front, on the spot where the old&#10;house really stood, a little garden was planted, and wild vines&#10;grew up over the neighboring walls; in front of the garden were&#10;large iron railings and a great gate, which looked very stately.&#10;People used to stop and peep through the railings. The sparrows&#10;assembled in dozens upon the wild vines, and chattered all together&#10;as loud as they could, but not about the old house; none of them&#10;could remember it, for many years had passed by, so many indeed,&#10;that the little boy was now a man, and a really good man too, and&#10;his parents were very proud of him. He was just married, and had&#10;come, with his young wife, to reside in the new house with the&#10;garden in front of it, and now he stood there by her side while she&#10;planted a field flower that she thought very pretty. She was&#10;planting it herself with her little hands, and pressing down the&#10;earth with her fingers. &#34;Oh dear, what was that?&#34; she exclaimed, as&#10;something pricked her. Out of the soft earth something was sticking&#10;up. It was&#8212;only think!&#8212;it was really the tin soldier, the very same&#10;which had been lost up in the old man&#39;s room, and had been hidden&#10;among old wood and rubbish for a long time, till it sunk into the&#10;earth, where it must have been for many years. And the young wife&#10;wiped the soldier, first with a green leaf, and then with her fine&#10;pocket-handkerchief, that smelt of such beautiful perfume. And the&#10;tin soldier felt as if he was recovering from a fainting fit. &#34;Let&#10;me see him,&#34; said the young man, and then he smiled and shook his&#10;head, and said, &#34;It can scarcely be the same, but it reminds me of&#10;something that happened to one of my tin soldiers when I was a&#10;little boy.&#34; And then he told his wife about the old house and the&#10;old man, and of the tin soldier which he had sent across, because&#10;he thought the old man was lonely; and he related the story so&#10;clearly that tears came into the eyes of the young wife for the old&#10;house and the old man. &#34;It is very likely that this is really the&#10;same soldier,&#34; said she, and I will take care of him, and always&#10;remember what you have told me; but some day you must show me the&#10;old man&#39;s grave.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I don&#39;t know where it is,&#34; he replied; &#34;no one knows. All&#10;his friends are dead; no one took care of him, and I was only a&#10;little boy.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, how dreadfully lonely he must have been,&#34; said&#10;she.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, terribly lonely,&#34; cried the tin soldier; &#34;still it&#10;is delightful not to be forgotten.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Delightful indeed,&#34; cried a voice quite near to them; no&#10;one but the tin soldier saw that it came from a rag of the leather&#10;which hung in tatters; it had lost all its gilding, and looked like&#10;wet earth, but it had an opinion, and it spoke it thus:&#8212;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Gilding will fade in damp weather,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;To endure, there is nothing like leather.&#34;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But the tin soldier did not believe any such&#10;thing.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;What the Old Man Does Is Always Right'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;I WILL tell you a story that was told me when I was a&#10;little boy. Every time I thought of this story, it seemed to me&#10;more and more charming; for it is with stories as it is with many&#10;people&#8212;they become better as they grow older.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;I have no doubt that you have been in the country, and&#10;seen a very old farmhouse, with a thatched roof, and mosses and&#10;small plants growing wild upon it. There is a stork&#39;s nest on the&#10;ridge of the gable, for we cannot do without the stork. The walls&#10;of the house are sloping, and the windows are low, and only one of&#10;the latter is made to open. The baking-oven sticks out of the wall&#10;like a great knob. An elder-tree hangs over the palings; and&#10;beneath its branches, at the foot of the paling, is a pool of&#10;water, in which a few ducks are disporting themselves. There is a&#10;yard-dog too, who barks at all corners. Just such a farmhouse as&#10;this stood in a country lane; and in it dwelt an old couple, a&#10;peasant and his wife. Small as their possessions were, they had one&#10;article they could not do without, and that was a horse, which&#10;contrived to live upon the grass which it found by the side of the&#10;high road. The old peasant rode into the town upon this horse, and&#10;his neighbors often borrowed it of him, and paid for the loan of it&#10;by rendering some service to the old couple. After a time they&#10;thought it would be as well to sell the horse, or exchange it for&#10;something which might be more useful to them. But what might this&#10;something be?&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You&#39;ll know best, old man,&#34; said the wife. &#34;It is&#10;fair-day to-day; so ride into town, and get rid of the horse for&#10;money, or make a good exchange; whichever you do will be right to&#10;me, so ride to the fair.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And she fastened his neckerchief for him; for she could do&#10;that better than he could, and she could also tie it very prettily&#10;in a double bow. She also smoothed his hat round and round with the&#10;palm of her hand, and gave him a kiss. Then he rode away upon the&#10;horse that was to be sold or bartered for something else. Yes, the&#10;old man knew what he was about. The sun shone with great heat, and&#10;not a cloud was to be seen in the sky. The road was very dusty; for&#10;a number of people, all going to the fair, were driving, riding, or&#10;walking upon it. There was no shelter anywhere from the hot&#10;sunshine. Among the rest a man came trudging along, and driving a&#10;cow to the fair. The cow was as beautiful a creature as any cow&#10;could be.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;She gives good milk, I am certain,&#34; said the peasant to&#10;himself. &#34;That would be a very good exchange: the cow for the&#10;horse. Hallo there! you with the cow,&#34; he said. &#34;I tell you what; I&#10;dare say a horse is of more value than a cow; but I don&#39;t care for&#10;that,&#8212;a cow will be more useful to me; so, if you like, we&#39;ll&#10;exchange.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;To be sure I will,&#34; said the man.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Accordingly the exchange was made; and as the matter was&#10;settled, the peasant might have turned back; for he had done the&#10;business he came to do. But, having made up his mind to go to the&#10;fair, he determined to do so, if only to have a look at it; so on&#10;he went to the town with his cow. Leading the animal, he strode on&#10;sturdily, and, after a short time, overtook a man who was driving a&#10;sheep. It was a good fat sheep, with a fine fleece on its&#10;back.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I should like to have that fellow,&#34; said the peasant to&#10;himself. &#34;There is plenty of grass for him by our palings, and in&#10;the winter we could keep him in the room with us. Perhaps it would&#10;be more profitable to have a sheep than a cow. Shall I&#10;exchange?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The man with the sheep was quite ready, and the bargain&#10;was quickly made. And then our peasant continued his way on the&#10;high-road with his sheep. Soon after this, he overtook another man,&#10;who had come into the road from a field, and was carrying a large&#10;goose under his arm.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What a heavy creature you have there!&#34; said the peasant;&#10;&#34;it has plenty of feathers and plenty of fat, and would look well&#10;tied to a string, or paddling in the water at our place. That would&#10;be very useful to my old woman; she could make all sorts of profits&#10;out of it. How often she has said, &#39;If now we only had a goose!&#39;&#10;Now here is an opportunity, and, if possible, I will get it for&#10;her. Shall we exchange? I will give you my sheep for your goose,&#10;and thanks into the bargain.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The other had not the least objection, and accordingly the&#10;exchange was made, and our peasant became possessor of the goose.&#10;By this time he had arrived very near the town. The crowd on the&#10;high road had been gradually increasing, and there was quite a rush&#10;of men and cattle. The cattle walked on the path and by the&#10;palings, and at the turnpike-gate they even walked into the&#10;toll-keeper&#39;s potato-field, where one fowl was strutting about with&#10;a string tied to its leg, for fear it should take fright at the&#10;crowd, and run away and get lost. The tail-feathers of the fowl&#10;were very short, and it winked with both its eyes, and looked very&#10;cunning, as it said &#34;Cluck, cluck.&#34; What were the thoughts of the&#10;fowl as it said this I cannot tell you; but directly our good man&#10;saw it, he thought, &#34;Why that&#39;s the finest fowl I ever saw in my&#10;life; it&#39;s finer than our parson&#39;s brood hen, upon my word. I&#10;should like to have that fowl. Fowls can always pick up a few&#10;grains that lie about, and almost keep themselves. I think it would&#10;be a good exchange if I could get it for my goose. Shall we&#10;exchange?&#34; he asked the toll-keeper.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Exchange,&#34; repeated the man; &#34;well, it would not be a bad&#10;thing.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And so they made an exchange,&#8212;the toll-keeper at the&#10;turnpike-gate kept the goose, and the peasant carried off the fowl.&#10;Now he had really done a great deal of business on his way to the&#10;fair, and he was hot and tired. He wanted something to eat, and a&#10;glass of ale to refresh himself; so he turned his steps to an inn.&#10;He was just about to enter when the ostler came out, and they met&#10;at the door. The ostler was carrying a sack. &#34;What have you in that&#10;sack?&#34; asked the peasant.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Rotten apples,&#34; answered the ostler; &#34;a whole sackful of&#10;them. They will do to feed the pigs with.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Why that will be terrible waste,&#34; he replied; &#34;I should&#10;like to take them home to my old woman. Last year the old&#10;apple-tree by the grass-plot only bore one apple, and we kept it in&#10;the cupboard till it was quite withered and rotten. It was always&#10;property, my old woman said; and here she would see a great deal of&#10;property&#8212;a whole sackful; I should like to show them to&#10;her.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What will you give me for the sackful?&#34; asked the&#10;ostler.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What will I give? Well, I will give you my fowl in&#10;exchange.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;So he gave up the fowl, and received the apples, which he&#10;carried into the inn parlor. He leaned the sack carefully against&#10;the stove, and then went to the table. But the stove was hot, and&#10;he had not thought of that. Many guests were present&#8212;horse dealers,&#10;cattle drovers, and two Englishmen. The Englishmen were so rich&#10;that their pockets quite bulged out and seemed ready to burst; and&#10;they could bet too, as you shall hear. &#34;Hiss-s-s, hiss-s-s.&#34; What&#10;could that be by the stove? The apples were beginning to roast.&#10;&#34;What is that?&#34; asked one.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Why, do you know&#34;&#8212;said our peasant. And then he told them&#10;the whole story of the horse, which he had exchanged for a cow, and&#10;all the rest of it, down to the apples.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Well, your old woman will give it you well when you get&#10;home,&#34; said one of the Englishmen. &#34;Won&#39;t there be a&#10;noise?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What! Give me what?&#34; said the peasant. &#34;Why, she will&#10;kiss me, and say, &#39;what the old man does is always&#10;right.&#39;&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Let us lay a wager on it,&#34; said the Englishmen. &#34;We&#39;ll&#10;wager you a ton of coined gold, a hundred pounds to the&#10;hundred-weight.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No; a bushel will be enough,&#34; replied the peasant. &#34;I can&#10;only set a bushel of apples against it, and I&#39;ll throw myself and&#10;my old woman into the bargain; that will pile up the measure, I&#10;fancy.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Done! taken!&#34; and so the bet was made.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the landlord&#39;s coach came to the door, and the two&#10;Englishmen and the peasant got in, and away they drove, and soon&#10;arrived and stopped at the peasant&#39;s hut. &#34;Good evening, old&#10;woman.&#34; &#34;Good evening, old man.&#34; &#34;I&#39;ve made the&#10;exchange.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ah, well, you understand what you&#39;re about,&#34; said the&#10;woman. Then she embraced him, and paid no attention to the&#10;strangers, nor did she notice the sack.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I got a cow in exchange for the horse.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Thank Heaven,&#34; said she. &#34;Now we shall have plenty of&#10;milk, and butter, and cheese on the table. That was a capital&#10;exchange.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, but I changed the cow for a sheep.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ah, better still!&#34; cried the wife. &#34;You always think of&#10;everything; we have just enough pasture for a sheep. Ewe&#39;s milk and&#10;cheese, woollen jackets and stockings! The cow could not give all&#10;these, and her hair only falls off. How you think of&#10;everything!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But I changed away the sheep for a goose.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Then we shall have roast goose to eat this year. You dear&#10;old man, you are always thinking of something to please me. This is&#10;delightful. We can let the goose walk about with a string tied to&#10;her leg, so she will be fatter still before we roast&#10;her.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But I gave away the goose for a fowl.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;A fowl! Well, that was a good exchange,&#34; replied the&#10;woman. &#34;The fowl will lay eggs and hatch them, and we shall have&#10;chickens; we shall soon have a poultry-yard. Oh, this is just what&#10;I was wishing for.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, but I exchanged the fowl for a sack of shrivelled&#10;apples.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What! I really must give you a kiss for that!&#34; exclaimed&#10;the wife. &#34;My dear, good husband, now I&#39;ll tell you something. Do&#10;you know, almost as soon as you left me this morning, I began to&#10;think of what I could give you nice for supper this evening, and&#10;then I thought of fried eggs and bacon, with sweet herbs; I had&#10;eggs and bacon, but I wanted the herbs; so I went over to the&#10;schoolmaster&#39;s: I knew they had plenty of herbs, but the&#10;schoolmistress is very mean, although she can smile so sweetly. I&#10;begged her to lend me a handful of herbs. &#39;Lend!&#39; she exclaimed, &#39;I&#10;have nothing to lend; nothing at all grows in our garden, not even&#10;a shrivelled apple; I could not even lend you a shrivelled apple,&#10;my dear woman. But now I can lend her ten, or a whole sackful,&#10;which I&#39;m very glad of; it makes me laugh to think about it;&#34; and&#10;then she gave him a hearty kiss.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Well, I like all this,&#34; said both the Englishmen; &#34;always&#10;going down the hill, and yet always merry; it&#39;s worth the money to&#10;see it.&#34; So they paid a hundred-weight of gold to the peasant, who,&#10;whatever he did, was not scolded but kissed.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Yes, it always pays best when the wife sees and maintains&#10;that her husband knows best, and whatever he does is&#10;right.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;That is a story which I heard when I was a child; and now&#10;you have heard it too, and know that &#34;What the old man does is&#10;always right.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Old Street Lamp'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;DID you ever hear the story of the old street lamp? It is&#10;not remarkably interesting, but for once in a way you may as well&#10;listen to it. It was a most respectable old lamp, which had seen&#10;many, many years of service, and now was to retire with a pension.&#10;It was this evening at its post for the last time, giving light to&#10;the street. His feelings were something like those of an old dancer&#10;at the theatre, who is dancing for the last time, and knows that on&#10;the morrow she will be in her garret, alone and forgotten. The lamp&#10;had very great anxiety about the next day, for he knew that he had&#10;to appear for the first time at the town hall, to be inspected by&#10;the mayor and the council, who were to decide if he were fit for&#10;further service or not;&#8212;whether the lamp was good enough to be used&#10;to light the inhabitants of one of the suburbs, or in the country,&#10;at some factory; and if not, it would be sent at once to an iron&#10;foundry, to be melted down. In this latter case it might be turned&#10;into anything, and he wondered very much whether he would then be&#10;able to remember that he had once been a street lamp, and it&#10;troubled him exceedingly. Whatever might happen, one thing seemed&#10;certain, that he would be separated from the watchman and his wife,&#10;whose family he looked upon as his own. The lamp had first been&#10;hung up on that very evening that the watchman, then a robust young&#10;man, had entered upon the duties of his office. Ah, well, it was a&#10;very long time since one became a lamp and the other a watchman.&#10;His wife had a little pride in those days; she seldom condescended&#10;to glance at the lamp, excepting when she passed by in the evening,&#10;never in the daytime. But in later years, when all these,&#8212;the&#10;watchman, the wife, and the lamp&#8212;had grown old, she had attended to&#10;it, cleaned it, and supplied it with oil. The old people were&#10;thoroughly honest, they had never cheated the lamp of a single drop&#10;of the oil provided for it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;This was the lamp&#39;s last night in the street, and&#10;to-morrow he must go to the town-hall,&#8212;two very dark things to&#10;think of. No wonder he did not burn brightly. Many other thoughts&#10;also passed through his mind. How many persons he had lighted on&#10;their way, and how much he had seen; as much, very likely, as the&#10;mayor and corporation themselves! None of these thoughts were&#10;uttered aloud, however; for he was a good, honorable old lamp, who&#10;would not willingly do harm to any one, especially to those in&#10;authority. As many things were recalled to his mind, the light&#10;would flash up with sudden brightness; he had, at such moments, a&#10;conviction that he would be remembered. &#34;There was a handsome young&#10;man once,&#34; thought he; &#34;it is certainly a long while ago, but I&#10;remember he had a little note, written on pink paper with a gold&#10;edge; the writing was elegant, evidently a lady&#39;s hand: twice he&#10;read it through, and kissed it, and then looked up at me, with eyes&#10;that said quite plainly, &#39;I am the happiest of men!&#39; Only he and I&#10;know what was written on this his first letter from his lady-love.&#10;Ah, yes, and there was another pair of eyes that I remember,&#8212;it is&#10;really wonderful how the thoughts jump from one thing to another! A&#10;funeral passed through the street; a young and beautiful woman lay&#10;on a bier, decked with garlands of flowers, and attended by&#10;torches, which quite overpowered my light. All along the street&#10;stood the people from the houses, in crowds, ready to join the&#10;procession. But when the torches had passed from before me, and I&#10;could look round, I saw one person alone, standing, leaning against&#10;my post, and weeping. Never shall I forget the sorrowful eyes that&#10;looked up at me.&#34; These and similar reflections occupied the old&#10;street lamp, on this the last time that his light would shine. The&#10;sentry, when he is relieved from his post, knows at least who will&#10;succeed him, and may whisper a few words to him, but the lamp did&#10;not know his successor, or he could have given him a few hints&#10;respecting rain, or mist, and could have informed him how far the&#10;moon&#39;s rays would rest on the pavement, and from which side the&#10;wind generally blew, and so on.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;On the bridge over the canal stood three persons, who&#10;wished to recommend themselves to the lamp, for they thought he&#10;could give the office to whomsoever he chose. The first was a&#10;herring&#39;s head, which could emit light in the darkness. He remarked&#10;that it would be a great saving of oil if they placed him on the&#10;lamp-post. Number two was a piece of rotten wood, which also shines&#10;in the dark. He considered himself descended from an old stem, once&#10;the pride of the forest. The third was a glow-worm, and how he&#10;found his way there the lamp could not imagine, yet there he was,&#10;and could really give light as well as the others. But the rotten&#10;wood and the herring&#39;s head declared most solemnly, by all they&#10;held sacred, that the glow-worm only gave light at certain times,&#10;and must not be allowed to compete with themselves. The old lamp&#10;assured them that not one of them could give sufficient light to&#10;fill the position of a street lamp; but they would believe nothing&#10;he said. And when they discovered that he had not the power of&#10;naming his successor, they said they were very glad to hear it, for&#10;the lamp was too old and worn-out to make a proper&#10;choice.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;At this moment the wind came rushing round the corner of&#10;the street, and through the air-holes of the old lamp. &#34;What is&#10;this I hear?&#34; said he; &#34;that you are going away to-morrow? Is this&#10;evening the last time we shall meet? Then I must present you with a&#10;farewell gift. I will blow into your brain, so that in future you&#10;shall not only be able to remember all that you have seen or heard&#10;in the past, but your light within shall be so bright, that you&#10;shall be able to understand all that is said or done in your&#10;presence.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, that is really a very, very great gift,&#34; said the old&#10;lamp; &#34;I thank you most heartily. I only hope I shall not be melted&#10;down.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That is not likely to happen yet,&#34; said the wind; &#34;and I&#10;will also blow a memory into you, so that should you receive other&#10;similar presents your old age will pass very&#10;pleasantly.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That is if I am not melted down,&#34; said the lamp. &#34;But&#10;should I in that case still retain my memory?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Do be reasonable, old lamp,&#34; said the wind, puffing&#10;away.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;At this moment the moon burst forth from the clouds. &#34;What&#10;will you give the old lamp?&#34; asked the wind.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I can give nothing,&#34; she replied; &#34;I am on the wane, and&#10;no lamps have ever given me light while I have frequently shone&#10;upon them.&#34; And with these words the moon hid herself again behind&#10;the clouds, that she might be saved from further importunities.&#10;Just then a drop fell upon the lamp, from the roof of the house,&#10;but the drop explained that he was a gift from those gray clouds,&#10;and perhaps the best of all gifts. &#34;I shall penetrate you so&#10;thoroughly,&#34; he said, &#34;that you will have the power of becoming&#10;rusty, and, if you wish it, to crumble into dust in one&#10;night.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But this seemed to the lamp a very shabby present, and the&#10;wind thought so too. &#34;Does no one give any more? Will no one give&#10;any more?&#34; shouted the breath of the wind, as loud as it could.&#10;Then a bright falling star came down, leaving a broad, luminous&#10;streak behind it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What was that?&#34; cried the herring&#39;s head. &#34;Did not a star&#10;fall? I really believe it went into the lamp. Certainly, when such&#10;high-born personages try for the office, we may as well say&#10;&#39;Good-night,&#39; and go home.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And so they did, all three, while the old lamp threw a&#10;wonderfully strong light all around him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;This is a glorious gift,&#34; said he; &#34;the bright stars have&#10;always been a joy to me, and have always shone more brilliantly&#10;than I ever could shine, though I have tried with my whole might;&#10;and now they have noticed me, a poor old lamp, and have sent me a&#10;gift that will enable me to see clearly everything that I remember,&#10;as if it still stood before me, and to be seen by all those who&#10;love me. And herein lies the truest pleasure, for joy which we&#10;cannot share with others is only half enjoyed.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That sentiment does you honor,&#34; said the wind; &#34;but for&#10;this purpose wax lights will be necessary. If these are not lighted&#10;in you, your particular faculties will not benefit others in the&#10;least. The stars have not thought of this; they suppose that you&#10;and every other light must be a wax taper: but I must go down now.&#34;&#10;So he laid himself to rest.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Wax tapers, indeed!&#34; said the lamp, &#34;I have never yet had&#10;these, nor is it likely I ever shall. If I could only be sure of&#10;not being melted down!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The next day. Well, perhaps we had better pass over the&#10;next day. The evening had come, and the lamp was resting in a&#10;grandfather&#39;s chair, and guess where! Why, at the old watchman&#39;s&#10;house. He had begged, as a favor, that the mayor and corporation&#10;would allow him to keep the street lamp, in consideration of his&#10;long and faithful service, as he had himself hung it up and lit it&#10;on the day he first commenced his duties, four-and-twenty years&#10;ago. He looked upon it almost as his own child; he had no children,&#10;so the lamp was given to him. There it lay in the great arm-chair&#10;near to the warm stove. It seemed almost as if it had grown larger,&#10;for it appeared quite to fill the chair. The old people sat at&#10;their supper, casting friendly glances at the old lamp, whom they&#10;would willingly have admitted to a place at the table. It is quite&#10;true that they dwelt in a cellar, two yards deep in the earth, and&#10;they had to cross a stone passage to get to their room, but within&#10;it was warm and comfortable and strips of list had been nailed&#10;round the door. The bed and the little window had curtains, and&#10;everything looked clean and neat. On the window seat stood two&#10;curious flower-pots which a sailor, named Christian, had brought&#10;over from the East or West Indies. They were of clay, and in the&#10;form of two elephants, with open backs; they were hollow and filled&#10;with earth, and through the open space flowers bloomed. In one grew&#10;some very fine chives or leeks; this was the kitchen garden. The&#10;other elephant, which contained a beautiful geranium, they called&#10;their flower garden. On the wall hung a large colored print,&#10;representing the congress of Vienna, and all the kings and emperors&#10;at once. A clock, with heavy weights, hung on the wall and went&#10;&#34;tick, tick,&#34; steadily enough; yet it was always rather too fast,&#10;which, however, the old people said was better than being too slow.&#10;They were now eating their supper, while the old street lamp, as we&#10;have heard, lay in the grandfather&#39;s arm-chair near the stove. It&#10;seemed to the lamp as if the whole world had turned round; but&#10;after a while the old watchman looked at the lamp, and spoke of&#10;what they had both gone through together,&#8212;in rain and in fog;&#10;during the short bright nights of summer, or in the long winter&#10;nights, through the drifting snow-storms, when he longed to be at&#10;home in the cellar. Then the lamp felt it was all right again. He&#10;saw everything that had happened quite clearly, as if it were&#10;passing before him. Surely the wind had given him an excellent&#10;gift. The old people were very active and industrious, they were&#10;never idle for even a single hour. On Sunday afternoons they would&#10;bring out some books, generally a book of travels which they were&#10;very fond of. The old man would read aloud about Africa, with its&#10;great forests and the wild elephants, while his wife would listen&#10;attentively, stealing a glance now and then at the clay elephants,&#10;which served as flower-pots.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I can almost imagine I am seeing it all,&#34; she said; and&#10;then how the lamp wished for a wax taper to be lighted in him, for&#10;then the old woman would have seen the smallest detail as clearly&#10;as he did himself. The lofty trees, with their thickly entwined&#10;branches, the naked negroes on horseback, and whole herds of&#10;elephants treading down bamboo thickets with their broad, heavy&#10;feet.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What is the use of all my capabilities,&#34; sighed the old&#10;lamp, &#34;when I cannot obtain any wax lights; they have only oil and&#10;tallow here, and these will not do.&#34; One day a great heap of&#10;wax-candle ends found their way into the cellar. The larger pieces&#10;were burnt, and the smaller ones the old woman kept for waxing her&#10;thread. So there were now candles enough, but it never occurred to&#10;any one to put a little piece in the lamp.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Here I am now with my rare powers,&#34; thought the lamp, &#34;I&#10;have faculties within me, but I cannot share them; they do not know&#10;that I could cover these white walls with beautiful tapestry, or&#10;change them into noble forests, or, indeed, to anything else they&#10;might wish for.&#34; The lamp, however, was always kept clean and&#10;shining in a corner where it attracted all eyes. Strangers looked&#10;upon it as lumber, but the old people did not care for that; they&#10;loved the lamp. One day&#8212;it was the watchman&#39;s birthday&#8212;the old&#10;woman approached the lamp, smiling to herself, and said, &#34;I will&#10;have an illumination to-day in honor of my old man.&#34; And the lamp&#10;rattled in his metal frame, for he thought, &#34;Now at last I shall&#10;have a light within me,&#34; but after all no wax light was placed in&#10;the lamp, but oil as usual. The lamp burned through the whole&#10;evening, and began to perceive too clearly that the gift of the&#10;stars would remain a hidden treasure all his life. Then he had a&#10;dream; for, to one with his faculties, dreaming was no difficulty.&#10;It appeared to him that the old people were dead, and that he had&#10;been taken to the iron foundry to be melted down. It caused him&#10;quite as much anxiety as on the day when he had been called upon to&#10;appear before the mayor and the council at the town-hall. But&#10;though he had been endowed with the power of falling into decay&#10;from rust when he pleased, he did not make use of it. He was&#10;therefore put into the melting-furnace and changed into as elegant&#10;an iron candlestick as you could wish to see, one intended to hold&#10;a wax taper. The candlestick was in the form of an angel holding a&#10;nosegay, in the centre of which the wax taper was to be placed. It&#10;was to stand on a green writing table, in a very pleasant room;&#10;many books were scattered about, and splendid paintings hung on the&#10;walls. The owner of the room was a poet, and a man of intellect;&#10;everything he thought or wrote was pictured around him. Nature&#10;showed herself to him sometimes in the dark forests, at others in&#10;cheerful meadows where the storks were strutting about, or on the&#10;deck of a ship sailing across the foaming sea with the clear, blue&#10;sky above, or at night the glittering stars. &#34;What powers I&#10;possess!&#34; said the lamp, awaking from his dream; &#34;I could almost&#10;wish to be melted down; but no, that must not be while the old&#10;people live. They love me for myself alone, they keep me bright,&#10;and supply me with oil. I am as well off as the picture of the&#10;congress, in which they take so much pleasure.&#34; And from that time&#10;he felt at rest in himself, and not more so than such an honorable&#10;old lamp really deserved to be.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)

In the evening,&#10;while the children are seated at the table or in their little&#10;chairs, he comes up the stairs very softly, for he walks in his&#10;socks, then he opens the doors without the slightest noise, and&#10;throws a small quantity of very fine dust in their eyes, just&#10;enough to prevent them from keeping them open, and so they do not&#10;see him. Then he creeps behind them, and blows softly upon their&#10;necks, till their heads begin to droop. But Ole-Luk-Oie does not&#10;wish to hurt them, for he is very fond of children, and only wants&#10;them to be quiet that he may relate to them pretty stories, and&#10;they never are quiet until they are in bed and asleep. As soon as&#10;they are asleep, Ole-Luk-Oie seats himself upon the bed. He is&#10;nicely dressed; his coat is made of silken stuff; it is impossible&#10;to say of what color, for it changes from green to red, and from&#10;red to blue as he turns from side to side. Under each arm he&#10;carries an umbrella; one of them, with pictures on the inside, he&#10;spreads over the good children, and then they dream the most&#10;beautiful stories the whole night. But the other umbrella has no&#10;pictures, and this he holds over the naughty children so that they&#10;sleep heavily, and wake in the morning without having dreamed at&#10;all.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Now we shall hear how Ole-Luk-Oie came every night during&#10;a whole week to the little boy named Hjalmar, and what he told him.&#10;There were seven stories, as there are seven days in the&#10;week.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;Our Aunt'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;You ought to have known our aunt; she was charming! That&#10;is to say, she was not charming at all as the word is usually&#10;understood; but she was good and kind, amusing in her way, and was&#10;just as any one ought to be whom people are to talk about and to&#10;laugh at. She might have been put into a play, and wholly and&#10;solely on account of the fact that she only lived for the theatre&#10;and for what was done there. She was an honorable matron; but Agent&#10;Fabs, whom she used to call &#34;Flabs,&#34; declared that our aunt was&#10;stage-struck.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The theatre is my school,&#34; said she, &#34;the source of my&#10;knowledge. From thence I have resuscitated Biblical history. Now,&#10;&#39;Moses&#39; and &#39;Joseph in Egypt&#39;&#8212;there are operas for you! I get my&#10;universal history from the theatre, my geography, and my knowledge&#10;of men. Out of the French pieces I get to know life in&#10;Paris&#8212;slippery, but exceedingly interesting. How I have cried over&#10;&#34;La Famille Roquebourg&#39;&#8212;that the man must drink himself to death,&#10;so that she may marry the young fellow! Yes, how many tears I have&#10;wept in the fifty years I have subscribed to the&#10;theatre!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Our aunt knew every acting play, every bit of scenery,&#10;every character, every one who appeared or had appeared. She seemed&#10;really only to live during the nine months the theatre was open.&#10;Summertime without a summer theatre seemed to be only a time that&#10;made her old; while, on the other hand, a theatrical evening that&#10;lasted till midnight was a lengthening of her life. She did not&#10;say, as other people do, &#34;Now we shall have spring, the stork is&#10;here,&#34; or, &#34;They&#39;ve advertised the first strawberries in the&#10;papers.&#34; She, on the contrary, used to announce the coming of&#10;autumn, with &#34;Have you heard they&#39;re selling boxes for the theatre?&#10;now the performances will begin.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;She used to value a lodging entirely according to its&#10;proximity to the theatre. It was a real sorrow to her when she had&#10;to leave the little lane behind the playhouse, and move into the&#10;great street that lay a little farther off, and live there in a&#10;house where she had no opposite neighbors.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;At home,&#34; said she, &#34;my windows must be my opera-box. One&#10;cannot sit and look into one&#39;s self till one&#39;s tired; one must see&#10;people. But now I live just as if I&#39;d go into the country. If I&#10;want to see human beings, I must go into my kitchen, and sit down&#10;on the sink, for there only I have opposite neighbors. No; when I&#10;lived in my dear little lane, I could look straight down into the&#10;ironmonger&#39;s shop, and had only three hundred paces to the theatre;&#10;and now I&#39;ve three thousand paces to go, military&#10;measurement.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Our aunt was sometimes ill, but however unwell she might&#10;feel, she never missed the play. The doctor prescribed one day that&#10;she should put her feet in a bran bath, and she followed his&#10;advice; but she drove to the theatre all the same, and sat with her&#10;feet in bran there. If she had died there, she would have been very&#10;glad. Thorwaldsen died in the theatre, and she called that a happy&#10;death.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;She could not imagine but that in heaven there must be a&#10;theatre too. It had not, indeed, been promised us, but we might&#10;very well imagine it. The many distinguished actors and actresses&#10;who had passed away must surely have a field for their&#10;talent.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Our aunt had an electric wire from the theatre to her&#10;room. A telegram used to be dispatched to her at coffee-time, and&#10;it used to consist of the words, &#34;Herr Sivertsen is at the&#10;machinery;&#34; for it was he who gave the signal for drawing the&#10;curtain up and down and for changing the scenes.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;From him she used to receive a short and concise&#10;description of every piece. His opinion of Shakspeare&#39;s &#34;Tempest,&#34;&#10;was, &#34;Mad nonsense! There&#39;s so much to put up, and the first scene&#10;begins with &#39;Water to the front of the wings.&#39;&#34; That is to say, the&#10;water had to come forward so far. But when, on the other hand, the&#10;same interior scene remained through five acts, he used to&#10;pronounce it a sensible, well-written play, a resting play, which&#10;performed itself, without putting up scenes.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In earlier times, by which name our aunt used to designate&#10;thirty years ago, she and the before-mentioned Herr Sivertsen had&#10;been younger. At that time he had already been connected with the&#10;machinery, and was, as she said, her benefactor. It used to be the&#10;custom in those days that in the evening performances in the only&#10;theatre the town possessed, spectators were admitted to the part&#10;called the &#34;flies,&#34; over the stage, and every machinist had one or&#10;two places to give away. Often the flies were quite full of good&#10;company; it was said that generals&#39; wives and privy councillors&#39;&#10;wives had been up there. It was quite interesting to look down&#10;behind the scenes, and to see how the people walked to and fro on&#10;the stage when the curtain was down.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Our aunt had been there several times, as well when there&#10;was a tragedy as when there was a ballet; for the pieces in which&#10;there were the greatest number of characters on the stage were the&#10;most interesting to see from the flies. One sat pretty much in the&#10;dark up there, and most people took their supper up with them. Once&#10;three apples and a great piece of bread and butter and sausage fell&#10;down right into the dungeon of Ugolino, where that unhappy man was&#10;to be starved to death; and there was great laughter among the&#10;audience. The sausage was one of the weightiest reasons why the&#10;worthy management refused in future to have any spectators up in&#10;the flies.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But I was there seven-and-thirty times,&#34; said our aunt,&#10;&#34;and I shall always remember Mr. Sivertsen for that.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;On the very last evening when the flies were still open to&#10;the public, the &#34;Judgment of Solomon&#34; was performed, as our aunt&#10;remembered very well. She had, through the influence of her&#10;benefactor, Herr Sivertsen, procured a free admission for the Agent&#10;Fabs, although he did not deserve it in the least, for he was&#10;always cutting his jokes about the theatre and teasing our aunt;&#10;but she had procured him a free admission to the flies, for all&#10;that. He wanted to look at this player-stuff from the other&#10;side.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Those were his own words, and they were just like him,&#34;&#10;said our aunt.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;He looked down from above on the &#39;Judgment of Solomon,&#34;&#10;and fell asleep over it. One would have thought that he had come&#10;from a dinner where many toasts had been given. He went to sleep,&#10;and was locked in. And there he sat through the dark night in the&#10;flies, and when he woke, he told a story, but our aunt would not&#10;believe it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The &#39;Judgment of Solomon&#39; was over,&#34; he said, &#34;and all&#10;the people had gone away, up stairs and down stairs; but now the&#10;real play began, the after-piece, which was the best of all,&#34; said&#10;the agent. &#34;Then life came into the affair. It was not the&#10;&#39;Judgment of Solomon&#39; that was performed; no, a real court of&#10;judgment was held upon the stage.&#34; And Agent Fabs had the impudence&#10;to try and make our aunt believe all this. That was the thanks she&#10;got for having got him a place in the flies.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;What did the agent say? Why, it was curious enough to&#10;hear, but there was malice and satire in it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It looked dark enough up there,&#34; said the agent; &#34;but&#10;then the magic business began&#8212;a great performance, &#39;The Judgment in&#10;the Theatre.&#39; The box-keepers were at their posts, and every&#10;spectator had to show his ghostly pass-book, that it might be&#10;decided if he was to be admitted with hands loose or bound, and&#10;with or without a muzzle. Grand people who came too late, when the&#10;performance had begun, and young people, who could not always watch&#10;the time, were tied up outside, and had list slippers put on their&#10;feet, with which they were allowed to go in before the beginning of&#10;the next act, and they had muzzles too. And then the &#39;Judgment on&#10;the Stage&#39; began.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;All malice, and not a bit of truth in it,&#34; said our&#10;aunt.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The painter, who wanted to get to Paradise, had to go up a&#10;staircase which he had himself painted, but which no man could&#10;mount. That was to expiate his sins against perspective. All the&#10;plants and buildings, which the property-man had placed, with&#10;infinite pains, in countries to which they did not belong, the poor&#10;fellow was obliged to put in their right places before cockcrow, if&#10;he wanted to get into Paradise. Let Herr Fabs see how he would get&#10;in himself; but what he said of the performers, tragedians and&#10;comedians, singers and dancers, that was the most rascally of all.&#10;Mr. Fabs, indeed!&#8212;Flabs! He did not deserve to be admitted at all,&#10;and our aunt would not soil her lips with what he said. And he&#10;said, did Flabs, that the whole was written down, and it should be&#10;printed when he was dead and buried, but not before, for he would&#10;not risk having his arms and legs broken.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Once our aunt had been in fear and trembling in her temple&#10;of happiness, the theatre. It was on a winter day, one of those&#10;days in which one has a couple of hours of daylight, with a gray&#10;sky. It was terribly cold and snowy, but aunt must go to the&#10;theatre. A little opera and a great ballet were performed, and a&#10;prologue and an epilogue into the bargain; and that would last till&#10;late at night. Our aunt must needs go; so she borrowed a pair of&#10;fur boots of her lodger&#8212;boots with fur inside and out, and which&#10;reached far up her legs.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;She got to the theatre, and to her box; the boots were&#10;warm, and she kept them on. Suddenly there was a cry of &#34;Fire!&#34;&#10;Smoke was coming from one of the side scenes, and streamed down&#10;from the flies, and there was a terrible panic. The people came&#10;rushing out, and our aunt was the last in the box, &#34;on the second&#10;tier, left-hand side, for from there the scenery looks best,&#34; she&#10;used to say. &#34;The scenes are always arranged that they look best&#10;from the King&#39;s side.&#34; Aunt wanted to come out, but the people&#10;before her, in their fright and heedlessness, slammed the door of&#10;the box; and there sat our aunt, and couldn&#39;t get out, and couldn&#39;t&#10;get in; that is to say, she couldn&#39;t get into the next box, for the&#10;partition was too high for her. She called out, and no one heard&#10;her; she looked down into the tier of boxes below her, and it was&#10;empty, and low, and looked quite near, and aunt in her terror felt&#10;quite young and light. She thought of jumping down, and had got one&#10;leg over the partition, the other resting on the bench. There she&#10;sat astride, as if on horseback, well wrapped up in her flowered&#10;cloak with one leg hanging out&#8212;a leg in a tremendous fur boot. That&#10;was a sight to behold; and when it was beheld, our aunt was heard&#10;too, and was saved from burning, for the theatre was not burned&#10;down.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;That was the most memorable evening of her life, and she&#10;was glad that she could not see herself, for she would have died&#10;with confusion.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Her benefactor in the machinery department, Herr&#10;Sivertsen, visited her every Sunday, but it was a long time from&#10;Sunday to Sunday. In the latter time, therefore, she used to have&#10;in a little child &#34;for the scraps;&#34; that is to say, to eat up the&#10;remains of the dinner. It was a child employed in the ballet, one&#10;that certainly wanted feeding. The little one used to appear,&#10;sometimes as an elf, sometimes as a page; the most difficult part&#10;she had to play was the lion&#39;s hind leg in the &#34;Magic Flute;&#34; but&#10;as she grew larger she could represent the fore-feet of the lion.&#10;She certainly only got half a guilder for that, whereas the hind&#10;legs were paid for with a whole guilder; but then she had to walk&#10;bent, and to do without fresh air. &#34;That was all very interesting&#10;to hear,&#34; said our aunt.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;She deserved to live as long as the theatre stood, but she&#10;could not last so long; and she did not die in the theatre, but&#10;respectably in her bed. Her last words were, moreover, not without&#10;meaning. She asked,&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What will the play be to-morrow?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;At her death she left about five hundred dollars. We&#10;presume this from the interest, which came to twenty dollars. This&#10;our aunt had destined as a legacy for a worthy old spinster who had&#10;no friends; it was to be devoted to a yearly subscription for a&#10;place in the second tier, on the left side, for the Saturday&#10;evening, &#34;for on that evening two pieces were always given,&#34; it&#10;said in the will; and the only condition laid upon the person who&#10;enjoyed the legacy was, that she should think, every Saturday&#10;evening, of our aunt, who was lying in her grave.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;This was our aunt&#39;s religion.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)

Palms, beech-trees, pines, plane-trees, and various other&#10;kinds, which are found in all parts of the world, were here like&#10;small branches, shooting forth from the great tree; while the&#10;larger boughs, with their knots and curves, formed valleys and&#10;hills, clothed with velvety green and covered with flowers.&#10;Everywhere it was like a blooming meadow or a lovely garden. Here&#10;were birds from all quarters of the world assembled together; birds&#10;from the primeval forests of America, from the rose gardens of&#10;Damascus, and from the deserts of Africa, in which the elephant and&#10;the lion may boast of being the only rulers. Birds from the Polar&#10;regions came flying here, and of course the stork and the swallow&#10;were not absent. But the birds were not the only living creatures.&#10;There were stags, squirrels, antelopes, and hundreds of other&#10;beautiful and light-footed animals here found a home.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The summit of the tree was a wide-spreading garden, and in&#10;the midst of it, where the green boughs formed a kind of hill,&#10;stood a castle of crystal, with a view from it towards every&#10;quarter of heaven. Each tower was erected in the form of a lily,&#10;and within the stern was a winding staircase, through which one&#10;could ascend to the top and step out upon the leaves as upon&#10;balconies. The calyx of the flower itself formed a most beautiful,&#10;glittering, circular hall, above which no other roof arose than the&#10;blue firmament and the sun and stars.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Just as much splendor, but of another kind, appeared&#10;below, in the wide halls of the castle. Here, on the walls, were&#10;reflected pictures of the world, which represented numerous and&#10;varied scenes of everything that took place daily, so that it was&#10;useless to read the newspapers, and indeed there were none to be&#10;obtained in this spot. All was to be seen in living pictures by&#10;those who wished it, but all would have been too much for even the&#10;wisest man, and this man dwelt here. His name is very difficult;&#10;you would not be able to pronounce it, so it may be omitted. He&#10;knew everything that a man on earth can know or imagine. Every&#10;invention already in existence or yet to be, was known to him, and&#10;much more; still everything on earth has a limit. The wise king&#10;Solomon was not half so wise as this man. He could govern the&#10;powers of nature and held sway over potent spirits; even Death&#10;itself was obliged to give him every morning a list of those who&#10;were to die during the day. And King Solomon himself had to die at&#10;last, and this fact it was which so often occupied the thoughts of&#10;this great man in the castle on the Tree of the Sun. He knew that&#10;he also, however high he might tower above other men in wisdom,&#10;must one day die. He knew that his children would fade away like&#10;the leaves of the forest and become dust. He saw the human race&#10;wither and fall like leaves from the tree; he saw new men come to&#10;fill their places, but the leaves that fell off never sprouted&#10;forth again; they crumbled to dust or were absorbed into other&#10;plants.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What happens to man,&#34; asked the wise man of himself,&#10;&#34;when touched by the angel of death? What can death be? The body&#10;decays, and the soul. Yes; what is the soul, and whither does it&#10;go?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;To eternal life,&#34; says the comforting voice of&#10;religion.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But what is this change? Where and how shall we&#10;exist?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Above; in heaven,&#34; answers the pious man; &#34;it is there we&#10;hope to go.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Above!&#34; repeated the wise man, fixing his eyes upon the&#10;moon and stars above him. He saw that to this earthly sphere above&#10;and below were constantly changing places, and that the position&#10;varied according to the spot on which a man found himself. He knew,&#10;also, that even if he ascended to the top of the highest mountain&#10;which rears its lofty summit on this earth, the air, which to us&#10;seems clear and transparent, would there be dark and cloudy; the&#10;sun would have a coppery glow and send forth no rays, and our earth&#10;would lie beneath him wrapped in an orange-colored mist. How narrow&#10;are the limits which confine the bodily sight, and how little can&#10;be seen by the eye of the soul. How little do the wisest among us&#10;know of that which is so important to us all.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the most secret chamber of the castle lay the greatest&#10;treasure on earth&#8212;the Book of Truth. The wise man had read it&#10;through page after page. Every man may read in this book, but only&#10;in fragments. To many eyes the characters seem so mixed in&#10;confusion that the words cannot be distinguished. On certain pages&#10;the writing often appears so pale or so blurred that the page&#10;becomes a blank. The wiser a man becomes, the more he will read,&#10;and those who are wisest read most.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The wise man knew how to unite the sunlight and the&#10;moonlight with the light of reason and the hidden powers of nature;&#10;and through this stronger light, many things in the pages were made&#10;clear to him. But in the portion of the book entitled &#34;Life after&#10;Death&#34; not a single point could he see distinctly. This pained him.&#10;Should he never be able here on earth to obtain a light by which&#10;everything written in the Book of Truth should become clear to him?&#10;Like the wise King Solomon, he understood the language of animals,&#10;and could interpret their talk into song; but that made him none&#10;the wiser. He found out the nature of plants and metals, and their&#10;power in curing diseases and arresting death, but none to destroy&#10;death itself. In all created things within his reach he sought the&#10;light that should shine upon the certainty of an eternal life, but&#10;he found it not. The Book of Truth lay open before him, but, its&#10;pages were to him as blank paper. Christianity placed before him in&#10;the Bible a promise of eternal life, but he wanted to read it in&#10;his book, in which nothing on the subject appeared to be&#10;written.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;He had five children; four sons, educated as the children&#10;of such a wise father should be, and a daughter, fair, gentle, and&#10;intelligent, but she was blind; yet this deprivation appeared as&#10;nothing to her; her father and brothers were outward eyes to her,&#10;and a vivid imagination made everything clear to her mental sight.&#10;The sons had never gone farther from the castle than the branches&#10;of the trees extended, and the sister had scarcely ever left home.&#10;They were happy children in that home of their childhood, the&#10;beautiful and fragrant Tree of the Sun. Like all children, they&#10;loved to hear stories related to them, and their father told them&#10;many things which other children would not have understood; but&#10;these were as clever as most grownup people are among us. He&#10;explained to them what they saw in the pictures of life on the&#10;castle walls&#8212;the doings of man, and the progress of events in all&#10;the lands of the earth; and the sons often expressed a wish that&#10;they could be present, and take a part in these great deeds. Then&#10;their father told them that in the world there was nothing but toil&#10;and difficulty: that it was not quite what it appeared to them, as&#10;they looked upon it in their beautiful home. He spoke to them of&#10;the true, the beautiful, and the good, and told them that these&#10;three held together in the world, and by that union they became&#10;crystallized into a precious jewel, clearer than a diamond of the&#10;first water&#8212;a jewel, whose splendor had a value even in the sight&#10;of God, in whose brightness all things are dim. This jewel was&#10;called the philosopher&#39;s stone. He told them that, by searching,&#10;man could attain to a knowledge of the existence of God, and that&#10;it was in the power of every man to discover the certainty that&#10;such a jewel as the philosopher&#39;s stone really existed. This&#10;information would have been beyond the perception of other&#10;children; but these children understood, and others will learn to&#10;comprehend its meaning after a time. They questioned their father&#10;about the true, the beautiful, and the good, and he explained it to&#10;them in many ways. He told them that God, when He made man out of&#10;the dust of the earth, touched His work five times, leaving five&#10;intense feelings, which we call the five senses. Through these, the&#10;true, the beautiful, and the good are seen, understood, and&#10;perceived, and through these they are valued, protected, and&#10;encouraged. Five senses have been given mentally and corporeally,&#10;inwardly and outwardly, to body and soul.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The children thought deeply on all these things, and&#10;meditated upon them day and night. Then the eldest of the brothers&#10;dreamt a splendid dream. Strange to say, not only the second&#10;brother but also the third and fourth brothers all dreamt exactly&#10;the same thing; namely, that each went out into the world to find&#10;the philosopher&#39;s stone. Each dreamt that he found it, and that, as&#10;he rode back on his swift horse, in the morning dawn, over the&#10;velvety green meadows, to his home in the castle of his father,&#10;that the stone gleamed from his forehead like a beaming light; and&#10;threw such a bright radiance upon the pages of the Book of Truth&#10;that every word was illuminated which spoke of the life beyond the&#10;grave. But the sister had no dream of going out into the wide&#10;world; it never entered her mind. Her world was her father&#39;s&#10;house.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I shall ride forth into the wide world,&#34; said the eldest&#10;brother. &#34;I must try what life is like there, as I mix with men. I&#10;will practise only the good and true; with these I will protect the&#10;beautiful. Much shall be changed for the better while I am&#10;there.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Now these thoughts were great and daring, as our thoughts&#10;generally are at home, before we have gone out into the world, and&#10;encountered its storms and tempests, its thorns and its thistles.&#10;In him, and in all his brothers, the five senses were highly&#10;cultivated, inwardly and outwardly; but each of them had one sense&#10;which in keenness and development surpassed the other four. In the&#10;case of the eldest, this pre-eminent sense was sight, which he&#10;hoped would be of special service. He had eyes for all times and&#10;all people; eyes that could discover in the depths of the earth&#10;hidden treasures, and look into the hearts of men, as through a&#10;pane of glass; he could read more than is often seen on the cheek&#10;that blushes or grows pale, in the eye that droops or smiles. Stags&#10;and antelopes accompanied him to the western boundary of his home,&#10;and there he found the wild swans. These he followed, and found&#10;himself far away in the north, far from the land of his father,&#10;which extended eastward to the ends of the earth. How he opened his&#10;eyes with astonishment! How many things were to be seen here! and&#10;so different to the mere representation of pictures such as those&#10;in his father&#39;s house. At first he nearly lost his eyes in&#10;astonishment at the rubbish and mockery brought forward to&#10;represent the beautiful; but he kept his eyes, and soon found full&#10;employment for them. He wished to go thoroughly and honestly to&#10;work in his endeavor to understand the true, the beautiful, and the&#10;good. But how were they represented in the world? He observed that&#10;the wreath which rightly belonged to the beautiful was often given&#10;the hideous; that the good was often passed by unnoticed, while&#10;mediocrity was applauded, when it should have been hissed. People&#10;look at the dress, not at the wearer; thought more of a name than&#10;of doing their duty; and trusted more to reputation than to real&#10;service. It was everywhere the same.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I see I must make a regular attack on these things,&#34; said&#10;he; and he accordingly did not spare them. But while looking for&#10;the truth, came the evil one, the father of lies, to intercept him.&#10;Gladly would the fiend have plucked out the eyes of this Seer, but&#10;that would have been a too straightforward path for him; he works&#10;more cunningly. He allowed the young man to seek for, and discover,&#10;the beautiful and the good; but while he was contemplating them,&#10;the evil spirit blew one mote after another into each of his eyes;&#10;and such a proceeding would injure the strongest sight. Then he&#10;blew upon the motes, and they became beams, so that the clearness&#10;of his sight was gone, and the Seer was like a blind man in the&#10;world, and had no longer any faith in it. He had lost his good&#10;opinion of the world, as well as of himself; and when a man gives&#10;up the world, and himself too, it is all over with him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;All over,&#34; said the wild swan, who flew across the sea to&#10;the east.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;All over,&#34; twittered the swallows, who were also flying&#10;eastward towards the Tree of the Sun. It was no good news which&#10;they carried home.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I think the Seer has been badly served,&#34; said the second&#10;brother, &#34;but the Hearer may be more successful.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;This one possessed the sense of hearing to a very high&#10;degree: so acute was this sense, that it was said he could hear the&#10;grass grow. He took a fond leave of all at home, and rode away,&#10;provided with good abilities and good intentions. The swallows&#10;escorted him, and he followed the swans till he found himself out&#10;in the world, and far away from home. But he soon discovered that&#10;one may have too much of a good thing. His hearing was too fine. He&#10;not only heard the grass grow, but could hear every man&#39;s heart&#10;beat, whether in sorrow or in joy. The whole world was to him like&#10;a clockmaker&#39;s great workshop, in which all the clocks were going&#10;&#34;tick, tick,&#34; and all the turret clocks striking &#34;ding, dong.&#34; It&#10;was unbearable. For a long time his ears endured it, but at last&#10;all the noise and tumult became too much for one man to&#10;bear.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;There were rascally boys of sixty years old&#8212;for years do&#10;not alone make a man&#8212;who raised a tumult, which might have made the&#10;Hearer laugh, but for the applause which followed, echoing through&#10;every street and house, and was even heard in country roads.&#10;Falsehood thrust itself forward and played the hypocrite; the bells&#10;on the fool&#39;s cap jingled, and declared they were church-bells, and&#10;the noise became so bad for the Hearer that he thrust his fingers&#10;into his ears. Still, he could hear false notes and bad singing,&#10;gossip and idle words, scandal and slander, groaning and moaning,&#10;without and within. &#34;Heaven help us!&#34; He thrust his fingers farther&#10;and farther into his ears, till at last the drums burst. And now he&#10;could hear nothing more of the true, the beautiful, and the good;&#10;for his hearing was to have been the means by which he hoped to&#10;acquire his knowledge. He became silent and suspicious, and at last&#10;trusted no one, not even himself, and no longer hoping to find and&#10;bring home the costly jewel, he gave it up, and gave himself up&#10;too, which was worse than all.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The birds in their flight towards the east, carried the&#10;tidings, and the news reached the castle in the Tree of the&#10;Sun.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I will try now,&#34; said the third brother; &#34;I have a keen&#10;nose.&#34; Now that was not a very elegant expression, but it was his&#10;way, and we must take him as he was. He had a cheerful temper, and&#10;was, besides, a real poet; he could make many things appear&#10;poetical, by the way in which he spoke of them, and ideas struck&#10;him long before they occurred to the minds of others. &#34;I can&#10;smell,&#34; he would say; and he attributed to the sense of smelling,&#10;which he possessed in a high degree, a great power in the region of&#10;the beautiful. &#34;I can smell,&#34; he would say, &#34;and many places are&#10;fragrant or beautiful according to the taste of the frequenters.&#10;One man feels at home in the atmosphere of the tavern, among the&#10;flaring tallow candles, and when the smell of spirits mingles with&#10;the fumes of bad tobacco. Another prefers sitting amidst the&#10;overpowering scent of jasmine, or perfuming himself with scented&#10;olive oil. This man seeks the fresh sea breeze, while that one&#10;climbs the lofty mountain-top, to look down upon the busy life in&#10;miniature beneath him.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;As he spoke in this way, it seemed as if he had already&#10;been out in the world, as if he had already known and associated&#10;with man. But this experience was intuitive&#8212;it was the poetry&#10;within him, a gift from Heaven bestowed on him in his cradle. He&#10;bade farewell to his parental roof in the Tree of the Sun, and&#10;departed on foot, from the pleasant scenes that surrounded his&#10;home. Arrived at its confines, he mounted on the back of an&#10;ostrich, which runs faster than a horse, and afterwards, when he&#10;fell in with the wild swans, he swung himself on the strongest of&#10;them, for he loved change, and away he flew over the sea to distant&#10;lands, where there were great forests, deep lakes, lofty mountains,&#10;and proud cities. Wherever he came it seemed as if sunshine&#10;travelled with him across the fields, for every flower, every bush,&#10;exhaled a renewed fragrance, as if conscious that a friend and&#10;protector was near; one who understood them, and knew their value.&#10;The stunted rose-bush shot forth twigs, unfolded its leaves, and&#10;bore the most beautiful roses; every one could see it, and even the&#10;black, slimy wood-snail noticed its beauty. &#34;I will give my seal to&#10;the flower,&#34; said the snail, &#34;I have trailed my slime upon it, I&#10;can do no more.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Thus it always fares with the beautiful in this world,&#34;&#10;said the poet. And he made a song upon it, and sung it after his&#10;own fashion, but nobody listened. Then he gave a drummer twopence&#10;and a peacock&#39;s feather, and composed a song for the drum, and the&#10;drummer beat it through the streets of the town, and when the&#10;people heard it they said, &#34;That is a capital tune.&#34; The poet wrote&#10;many songs about the true, the beautiful, and the good. His songs&#10;were listened to in the tavern, where the tallow candles flared, in&#10;the fresh clover field, in the forest, and on the high-seas; and it&#10;appeared as if this brother was to be more fortunate than the other&#10;two.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But the evil spirit was angry at this, so he set to work&#10;with soot and incense, which he can mix so artfully as to confuse&#10;an angel, and how much more easily a poor poet. The evil one knew&#10;how to manage such people. He so completely surrounded the poet&#10;with incense that the man lost his head, forgot his mission and his&#10;home, and at last lost himself and vanished in smoke.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But when the little birds heard of it, they mourned, and&#10;for three days they sang not one song. The black wood-snail became&#10;blacker still; not for grief, but for envy. &#34;They should have&#10;offered me incense,&#34; he said, &#34;for it was I who gave him the idea&#10;of the most famous of his songs&#8212;the drum song of &#39;The Way of the&#10;World;&#39; and it was I who spat at the rose; I can bring a witness to&#10;that fact.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But no tidings of all this reached the poet&#39;s home in&#10;India. The birds had all been silent for three days, and when the&#10;time of mourning was over, so deep had been their grief, that they&#10;had forgotten for whom they wept. Such is the way of the&#10;world.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Now I must go out into the world, and disappear like the&#10;rest,&#34; said the fourth brother. He was as good-tempered as the&#10;third, but no poet, though he could be witty.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The two eldest had filled the castle with joyfulness, and&#10;now the last brightness was going away. Sight and hearing have&#10;always been considered two of the chief senses among men, and those&#10;which they wish to keep bright; the other senses are looked upon as&#10;of less importance.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But the younger son had a different opinion; he had&#10;cultivated his taste in every way, and taste is very powerful. It&#10;rules over what goes into the mouth, as well as over all which is&#10;presented to the mind; and, consequently, this brother took upon&#10;himself to taste everything stored up in bottles or jars; this he&#10;called the rough part of his work. Every man&#39;s mind was to him as a&#10;vessel in which something was concocting; every land a kind of&#10;mental kitchen. &#34;There are no delicacies here,&#34; he said; so he&#10;wished to go out into the world to find something delicate to suit&#10;his taste. &#34;Perhaps fortune may be more favorable to me than it was&#10;to my brothers. I shall start on my travels, but what conveyance&#10;shall I choose? Are air balloons invented yet?&#34; he asked of his&#10;father, who knew of all inventions that had been made, or would be&#10;made.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Air balloons had not then been invented, nor steam-ships,&#10;nor railways.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Good,&#34; said he; &#34;then I shall choose an air balloon; my&#10;father knows how they are to be made and guided. Nobody has&#10;invented one yet, and the people will believe that it is an aerial&#10;phantom. When I have done with the balloon I shall burn it, and for&#10;this purpose, you must give me a few pieces of another invention,&#10;which will come next; I mean a few chemical matches.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;He obtained what he wanted, and flew away. The birds&#10;accompanied him farther than they had the other brothers. They were&#10;curious to know how this flight would end. Many more of them came&#10;swooping down; they thought it must be some new bird, and he soon&#10;had a goodly company of followers. They came in clouds till the air&#10;became darkened with birds as it was with the cloud of locusts over&#10;the land of Egypt.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And now he was out in the wide world. The balloon&#10;descended over one of the greatest cities, and the aeronaut took up&#10;his station at the highest point, on the church steeple. The&#10;balloon rose again into the air, which it ought not to have done;&#10;what became of it is not known, neither is it of any consequence,&#10;for balloons had not then been invented.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;There he sat on the church steeple. The birds no longer&#10;hovered over him; they had got tired of him, and he was tired of&#10;them. All the chimneys in the town were smoking.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;There are altars erected to my honor,&#34; said the wind, who&#10;wished to say something agreeable to him as he sat there boldly&#10;looking down upon the people in the street. There was one stepping&#10;along, proud of his purse; another, of the key he carried behind&#10;him, though he had nothing to lock up; another took a pride in his&#10;moth-eaten coat; and another, in his mortified body. &#34;Vanity, all&#10;vanity!&#34; he exclaimed. &#34;I must go down there by-and-by, and touch&#10;and taste; but I shall sit here a little while longer, for the wind&#10;blows pleasantly at my back. I shall remain here as long as the&#10;wind blows, and enjoy a little rest. It is comfortable to sleep&#10;late in the morning when one had a great deal to do,&#34; said the&#10;sluggard; &#34;so I shall stop here as long as the wind blows, for it&#10;pleases me.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And there he stayed. But as he was sitting on the&#10;weather-cock of the steeple, which kept turning round and round&#10;with him, he was under the false impression that the same wind&#10;still blew, and that he could stay where he was without&#10;expense.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But in India, in the castle on the Tree of the Sun, all&#10;was solitary and still, since the brothers had gone away one after&#10;the other.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Nothing goes well with them,&#34; said the father; &#34;they will&#10;never bring the glittering jewel home, it is not made for me; they&#10;are all dead and gone.&#34; Then he bent down over the Book of Truth,&#10;and gazed on the page on which he should have read of the life&#10;after death, but for him there was nothing to be read or learned&#10;upon it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;His blind daughter was his consolation and joy; she clung&#10;to him with sincere affection, and for the sake of his happiness&#10;and peace she wished the costly jewel could be found and brought&#10;home.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;With longing tenderness she thought of her brothers. Where&#10;were they? Where did they live? How she wished she might dream of&#10;them; but it was strange that not even in dreams could she be&#10;brought near to them. But at last one night she dreamt that she&#10;heard the voices of her brothers calling to her from the distant&#10;world, and she could not refrain herself, but went out to them, and&#10;yet it seemed in her dream that she still remained in her father&#39;s&#10;house. She did not see her brothers, but she felt as it were a fire&#10;burning in her hand, which, however, did not hurt her, for it was&#10;the jewel she was bringing to her father. When she awoke she&#10;thought for a moment that she still held the stone, but she only&#10;grasped the knob of her distaff.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;During the long evenings she had spun constantly, and&#10;round the distaff were woven threads finer than the web of a&#10;spider; human eyes could never have distinguished these threads&#10;when separated from each other. But she had wetted them with her&#10;tears, and the twist was as strong as a cable. She rose with the&#10;impression that her dream must be a reality, and her resolution was&#10;taken.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was still night, and her father slept; she pressed a&#10;kiss upon his hand, and then took her distaff and fastened the end&#10;of the thread to her father&#39;s house. But for this, blind as she&#10;was, she would never have found her way home again; to this thread&#10;she must hold fast, and trust not to others or even to herself.&#10;From the Tree of the Sun she broke four leaves; which she gave up&#10;to the wind and the weather, that they might be carried to her&#10;brothers as letters and a greeting, in case she did not meet them&#10;in the wide world. Poor blind child, what would become of her in&#10;those distant regions? But she had the invisible thread, to which&#10;she could hold fast; and she possessed a gift which all the others&#10;lacked. This was a determination to throw herself entirely into&#10;whatever she undertook, and it made her feel as if she had eyes&#10;even at the tips of her fingers, and could hear down into her very&#10;heart. Quietly she went forth into the noisy, bustling, wonderful&#10;world, and wherever she went the skies grew bright, and she felt&#10;the warm sunbeam, and a rainbow above in the blue heavens seemed to&#10;span the dark world. She heard the song of the birds, and smelt the&#10;scent of the orange groves and apple orchards so strongly that she&#10;seemed to taste it. Soft tones and charming songs reached her ear,&#10;as well as harsh sounds and rough words&#8212;thoughts and opinions in&#10;strange contradiction to each other. Into the deepest recesses of&#10;her heart penetrated the echoes of human thoughts and feelings. Now&#10;she heard the following words sadly sung,&#8212;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Life is a shadow that flits away&#60;br /&#62;&#10;In a night of darkness and woe.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But then would follow brighter thoughts:&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Life has the rose&#39;s sweet perfume&#60;br /&#62;&#10;With sunshine, light, and joy.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And if one stanza sounded painfully&#8212;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Each mortal thinks of himself alone,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Is a truth, alas, too clearly known;&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then, on the other hand, came the answer&#8212;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Love, like a mighty flowing stream,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Fills every heart with its radiant gleam.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;She heard, indeed, such words as these&#8212;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;In the pretty turmoil here below,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;All is a vain and paltry show.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then came also words of comfort&#8212;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Great and good are the actions done&#60;br /&#62;&#10;By many whose worth is never known.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And if sometimes the mocking strain reached&#10;her&#8212;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Why not join in the jesting cry&#60;br /&#62;&#10;That contemns all gifts from the throne on high?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the blind girl&#39;s heart a stronger voice&#10;repeated&#8212;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;To trust in thyself and God is best,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;In His holy will forever to rest.&#34;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But the evil spirit could not see this and remain&#10;contented. He has more cleverness than ten thousand men, and he&#10;found means to compass his end. He betook himself to the marsh, and&#10;collected a few little bubbles of stagnant water. Then he uttered&#10;over them the echoes of lying words that they might become strong.&#10;He mixed up together songs of praise with lying epitaphs, as many&#10;as he could find, boiled them in tears shed by envy; put upon them&#10;rouge, which he had scraped from faded cheeks, and from these he&#10;produced a maiden, in form and appearance like the blind girl, the&#10;angel of completeness, as men called her. The evil one&#39;s plot was&#10;successful. The world knew not which was the true, and indeed how&#10;should the world know?&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;To trust in thyself and God is best,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;In his Holy will forever to rest.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;So sung the blind girl in full faith. She had entrusted&#10;the four green leaves from the Tree of the Sun to the winds, as&#10;letters of greeting to her brothers, and she had full confidence&#10;that the leaves would reach them. She fully believed that the jewel&#10;which outshines all the glories of the world would yet be found,&#10;and that upon the forehead of humanity it would glitter even in the&#10;castle of her father. &#34;Even in my father&#39;s house,&#34; she repeated.&#10;&#34;Yes, the place in which this jewel is to be found is earth, and I&#10;shall bring more than the promise of it with me. I feel it glow and&#10;swell more and more in my closed hand. Every grain of truth which&#10;the keen wind carried up and whirled towards me I caught and&#10;treasured. I allowed it to be penetrated with the fragrance of the&#10;beautiful, of which there is so much in the world, even for the&#10;blind. I took the beatings of a heart engaged in a good action, and&#10;added them to my treasure. All that I can bring is but dust; still,&#10;it is a part of the jewel we seek, and there is plenty, my hand is&#10;quite full of it.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;She soon found herself again at home; carried thither in a&#10;flight of thought, never having loosened her hold of the invisible&#10;thread fastened to her father&#39;s house. As she stretched out her&#10;hand to her father, the powers of evil dashed with the fury of a&#10;hurricane over the Tree of the Sun; a blast of wind rushed through&#10;the open doors, and into the sanctuary, where lay the Book of&#10;Truth.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It will be blown to dust by the wind,&#34; said the father,&#10;as he seized the open hand she held towards him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No,&#34; she replied, with quiet confidence, &#34;it is&#10;indestructible. I feel its beam warming my very soul.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then her father observed that a dazzling flame gleamed&#10;from the white page on which the shining dust had passed from her&#10;hand. It was there to prove the certainty of eternal life, and on&#10;the book glowed one shining word, and only one, the word BELIEVE.&#10;And soon the four brothers were again with the father and daughter.&#10;When the green leaf from home fell on the bosom of each, a longing&#10;had seized them to return. They had arrived, accompanied by the&#10;birds of passage, the stag, the antelope, and all the creatures of&#10;the forest who wished to take part in their joy.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;We have often seen, when a sunbeam burst through a crack&#10;in the door into a dusty room, how a whirling column of dust seems&#10;to circle round. But this was not poor, insignificant, common dust,&#10;which the blind girl had brought; even the rainbow&#39;s colors are dim&#10;when compared with the beauty which shone from the page on which it&#10;had fallen. The beaming word BELIEVE, from every grain of truth,&#10;had the brightness of the beautiful and the good, more bright than&#10;the mighty pillar of flame that led Moses and the children of&#10;Israel to the land of Canaan, and from the word BELIEVE arose the&#10;bridge of hope, reaching even to the unmeasurable Love in the&#10;realms of the infinite.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Garden of Paradise'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;THERE was once a king&#39;s son who had a larger and more&#10;beautiful collection of books than any one else in the world, and&#10;full of splendid copper-plate engravings. He could read and obtain&#10;information respecting every people of every land; but not a word&#10;could he find to explain the situation of the garden of paradise,&#10;and this was just what he most wished to know. His grandmother had&#10;told him when he was quite a little boy, just old enough to go to&#10;school, that each flower in the garden of paradise was a sweet&#10;cake, that the pistils were full of rich wine, that on one flower&#10;history was written, on another geography or tables; so those who&#10;wished to learn their lessons had only to eat some of the cakes,&#10;and the more they ate, the more history, geography, or tables they&#10;knew. He believed it all then; but as he grew older, and learnt&#10;more and more, he became wise enough to understand that the&#10;splendor of the garden of paradise must be very different to all&#10;this. &#34;Oh, why did Eve pluck the fruit from the tree of knowledge?&#10;why did Adam eat the forbidden fruit?&#34; thought the king&#39;s son: &#34;if&#10;I had been there it would never have happened, and there would have&#10;been no sin in the world.&#34; The garden of paradise occupied all his&#10;thoughts till he reached his seventeenth year.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;One day he was walking alone in the wood, which was his&#10;greatest pleasure, when evening came on. The clouds gathered, and&#10;the rain poured down as if the sky had been a waterspout; and it&#10;was as dark as the bottom of a well at midnight; sometimes he&#10;slipped over the smooth grass, or fell over stones that projected&#10;out of the rocky ground. Every thing was dripping with moisture,&#10;and the poor prince had not a dry thread about him. He was obliged&#10;at last to climb over great blocks of stone, with water spurting&#10;from the thick moss. He began to feel quite faint, when he heard a&#10;most singular rushing noise, and saw before him a large cave, from&#10;which came a blaze of light. In the middle of the cave an immense&#10;fire was burning, and a noble stag, with its branching horns, was&#10;placed on a spit between the trunks of two pine-trees. It was&#10;turning slowly before the fire, and an elderly woman, as large and&#10;strong as if she had been a man in disguise, sat by, throwing one&#10;piece of wood after another into the flames.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Come in,&#34; she said to the prince; &#34;sit down by the fire&#10;and dry yourself.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;There is a great draught here,&#34; said the prince, as he&#10;seated himself on the ground.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It will be worse when my sons come home,&#34; replied the&#10;woman; &#34;you are now in the cavern of the Winds, and my sons are the&#10;four Winds of heaven: can you understand that?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Where are your sons?&#34; asked the prince.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It is difficult to answer stupid questions,&#34; said the&#10;woman. &#34;My sons have plenty of business on hand; they are playing&#10;at shuttlecock with the clouds up yonder in the king&#39;s hall,&#34; and&#10;she pointed upwards.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, indeed,&#34; said the prince; &#34;but you speak more roughly&#10;and harshly and are not so gentle as the women I am used&#10;to.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, that is because they have nothing else to do; but I&#10;am obliged to be harsh, to keep my boys in order, and I can do it,&#10;although they are so head-strong. Do you see those four sacks&#10;hanging on the wall? Well, they are just as much afraid of those&#10;sacks, as you used to be of the rat behind the looking-glass. I can&#10;bend the boys together, and put them in the sacks without any&#10;resistance on their parts, I can tell you. There they stay, and&#10;dare not attempt to come out until I allow them to do so. And here&#10;comes one of them.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was the North Wind who came in, bringing with him a&#10;cold, piercing blast; large hailstones rattled on the floor, and&#10;snowflakes were scattered around in all directions. He wore a&#10;bearskin dress and cloak. His sealskin cap was drawn over his ears,&#10;long icicles hung from his beard, and one hailstone after another&#10;rolled from the collar of his jacket.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Don&#39;t go too near the fire,&#34; said the prince, &#34;or your&#10;hands and face will be frost-bitten.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Frost-bitten!&#34; said the North Wind, with a loud laugh;&#10;&#34;why frost is my greatest delight. What sort of a little snip are&#10;you, and how did you find your way to the cavern of the&#10;Winds?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;He is my guest,&#34; said the old woman, &#34;and if you are not&#10;satisfied with that explanation you can go into the sack. Do you&#10;understand me?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;That settled the matter. So the North Wind began to relate&#10;his adventures, whence he came, and where he had been for a whole&#10;month. &#34;I come from the polar seas,&#34; he said; &#34;I have been on the&#10;Bear&#39;s Island with the Russian walrus-hunters. I sat and slept at&#10;the helm of their ship, as they sailed away from North Cape.&#10;Sometimes when I woke, the storm-birds would fly about my legs.&#10;They are curious birds; they give one flap with their wings, and&#10;then on their outstretched pinions soar far away.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Don&#39;t make such a long story of it,&#34; said the mother of&#10;the winds; &#34;what sort of a place is Bear&#39;s Island?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;A very beautiful place, with a floor for dancing as&#10;smooth and flat as a plate. Half-melted snow, partly covered with&#10;moss, sharp stones, and skeletons of walruses and polar-bears, lie&#10;all about, their gigantic limbs in a state of green decay. It would&#10;seem as if the sun never shone there. I blew gently, to clear away&#10;the mist, and then I saw a little hut, which had been built from&#10;the wood of a wreck, and was covered with the skins of the walrus,&#10;the fleshy side outwards; it looked green and red, and on the roof&#10;sat a growling bear. Then I went to the sea shore, to look after&#10;birds&#39; nests, and saw the unfledged nestlings opening their mouths&#10;and screaming for food. I blew into the thousand little throats,&#10;and quickly stopped their screaming. Farther on were the walruses&#10;with pig&#39;s heads, and teeth a yard long, rolling about like great&#10;worms.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You relate your adventures very well, my son,&#34; said the&#10;mother, &#34;it makes my mouth water to hear you.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;After that,&#34; continued the North Wind, &#34;the hunting&#10;commenced. The harpoon was flung into the breast of the walrus, so&#10;that a smoking stream of blood spurted forth like a fountain, and&#10;besprinkled the ice. Then I thought of my own game; I began to&#10;blow, and set my own ships, the great icebergs sailing, so that&#10;they might crush the boats. Oh, how the sailors howled and cried&#10;out! but I howled louder than they. They were obliged to unload&#10;their cargo, and throw their chests and the dead walruses on the&#10;ice. Then I sprinkled snow over them, and left them in their&#10;crushed boats to drift southward, and to taste salt water. They&#10;will never return to Bear&#39;s Island.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;So you have done mischief,&#34; said the mother of the&#10;Winds.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I shall leave others to tell the good I have done,&#34; he&#10;replied. &#34;But here comes my brother from the West; I like him best&#10;of all, for he has the smell of the sea about him, and brings in a&#10;cold, fresh air as he enters.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Is that the little Zephyr?&#34; asked the prince.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, it is the little Zephyr,&#34; said the old woman; &#34;but&#10;he is not little now. In years gone by he was a beautiful boy; now&#10;that is all past.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;He came in, looking like a wild man, and he wore a&#10;slouched hat to protect his head from injury. In his hand he&#10;carried a club, cut from a mahogany tree in the American forests,&#10;not a trifle to carry.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Whence do you come?&#34; asked the mother.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I come from the wilds of the forests, where the thorny&#10;brambles form thick hedges between the trees; where the water-snake&#10;lies in the wet grass, and mankind seem to be unknown.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What were you doing there?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I looked into the deep river, and saw it rushing down&#10;from the rocks. The water drops mounted to the clouds and glittered&#10;in the rainbow. I saw the wild buffalo swimming in the river, but&#10;the strong tide carried him away amidst a flock of wild ducks,&#10;which flew into the air as the waters dashed onwards, leaving the&#10;buffalo to be hurled over the waterfall. This pleased me; so I&#10;raised a storm, which rooted up old trees, and sent them floating&#10;down the river.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And what else have you done?&#34; asked the old&#10;woman.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I have rushed wildly across the savannahs; I have stroked&#10;the wild horses, and shaken the cocoa-nuts from the trees. Yes, I&#10;have many stories to relate; but I need not tell everything I know.&#10;You know it all very well, don&#39;t you, old lady?&#34; And he kissed his&#10;mother so roughly, that she nearly fell backwards. Oh, he was,&#10;indeed, a wild fellow.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Now in came the South Wind, with a turban and a flowing&#10;Bedouin cloak.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;How cold it is here!&#34; said he, throwing more wood on the&#10;fire. &#34;It is easy to feel that the North Wind has arrived here&#10;before me.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Why it is hot enough here to roast a bear,&#34; said the&#10;North Wind.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You are a bear yourself,&#34; said the other.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Do you want to be put in the sack, both of you?&#34; said the&#10;old woman. &#34;Sit down, now, on that stone, yonder, and tell me where&#10;you have been.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;In Africa, mother. I went out with the Hottentots, who&#10;were lion-hunting in the Kaffir land, where the plains are covered&#10;with grass the color of a green olive; and here I ran races with&#10;the ostrich, but I soon outstripped him in swiftness. At last I&#10;came to the desert, in which lie the golden sands, looking like the&#10;bottom of the sea. Here I met a caravan, and the travellers had&#10;just killed their last camel, to obtain water; there was very&#10;little for them, and they continued their painful journey beneath&#10;the burning sun, and over the hot sands, which stretched before&#10;them a vast, boundless desert. Then I rolled myself in the loose&#10;sand, and whirled it in burning columns over their heads. The&#10;dromedarys stood still in terror, while the merchants drew their&#10;caftans over their heads, and threw themselves on the ground before&#10;me, as they do before Allah, their god. Then I buried them beneath&#10;a pyramid of sand, which covers them all. When I blow that away on&#10;my next visit, the sun will bleach their bones, and travellers will&#10;see that others have been there before them; otherwise, in such a&#10;wild desert, they might not believe it possible.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;So you have done nothing but evil,&#34; said the mother.&#10;&#34;Into the sack with you;&#34; and, before he was aware, she had seized&#10;the South Wind round the body, and popped him into the bag. He&#10;rolled about on the floor, till she sat herself upon him to keep&#10;him still.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;These boys of yours are very lively,&#34; said the&#10;prince.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes,&#34; she replied, &#34;but I know how to correct them, when&#10;necessary; and here comes the fourth.&#34; In came the East Wind,&#10;dressed like a Chinese.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, you come from that quarter, do you?&#34; said she; &#34;I&#10;thought you had been to the garden of paradise.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I am going there to-morrow,&#34; he replied; &#34;I have not been&#10;there for a hundred years. I have just come from China, where I&#10;danced round the porcelain tower till all the bells jingled again.&#10;In the streets an official flogging was taking place, and bamboo&#10;canes were being broken on the shoulders of men of every high&#10;position, from the first to the ninth grade. They cried, &#39;Many&#10;thanks, my fatherly benefactor;&#39; but I am sure the words did not&#10;come from their hearts, so I rang the bells till they sounded,&#10;&#39;ding, ding-dong.&#39;&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You are a wild boy,&#34; said the old woman; &#34;it is well for&#10;you that you are going to-morrow to the garden of paradise; you&#10;always get improved in your education there. Drink deeply from the&#10;fountain of wisdom while you are there, and bring home a bottleful&#10;for me.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That I will,&#34; said the East Wind; &#34;but why have you put&#10;my brother South in a bag? Let him out; for I want him to tell me&#10;about the phoenix-bird. The princess always wants to hear of this&#10;bird when I pay her my visit every hundred years. If you will open&#10;the sack, sweetest mother, I will give you two pocketfuls of tea,&#10;green and fresh as when I gathered it from the spot where it&#10;grew.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Well, for the sake of the tea, and because you are my own&#10;boy, I will open the bag.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;She did so, and the South Wind crept out, looking quite&#10;cast down, because the prince had seen his disgrace.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;There is a palm-leaf for the princess,&#34; he said. &#34;The old&#10;phoenix, the only one in the world, gave it to me himself. He has&#10;scratched on it with his beak the whole of his history during the&#10;hundred years he has lived. She can there read how the old phoenix&#10;set fire to his own nest, and sat upon it while it was burning,&#10;like a Hindoo widow. The dry twigs around the nest crackled and&#10;smoked till the flames burst forth and consumed the phoenix to&#10;ashes. Amidst the fire lay an egg, red hot, which presently burst&#10;with a loud report, and out flew a young bird. He is the only&#10;phoenix in the world, and the king over all the other birds. He has&#10;bitten a hole in the leaf which I give you, and that is his&#10;greeting to the princess.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Now let us have something to eat,&#34; said the mother of the&#10;Winds. So they all sat down to feast on the roasted stag; and as&#10;the prince sat by the side of the East Wind, they soon became good&#10;friends.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Pray tell me,&#34; said the prince, &#34;who is that princess of&#10;whom you have been talking! and where lies the garden of&#10;paradise?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ho! ho!&#34; said the East Wind, &#34;would you like to go there?&#10;Well, you can fly off with me to-morrow; but I must tell you one&#10;thing&#8212;no human being has been there since the time of Adam and Eve.&#10;I suppose you have read of them in your Bible.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Of course I have,&#34; said the prince.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Well,&#34; continued the East Wind, &#34;when they were driven&#10;out of the garden of paradise, it sunk into the earth; but it&#10;retained its warm sunshine, its balmy air, and all its splendor.&#10;The fairy queen lives there, in the island of happiness, where&#10;death never comes, and all is beautiful. I can manage to take you&#10;there to-morrow, if you will sit on my back. But now don&#39;t talk any&#10;more, for I want to go to sleep;&#34; and then they all&#10;slept.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;When the prince awoke in the early morning, he was not a&#10;little surprised at finding himself high up above the clouds. He&#10;was seated on the back of the East Wind, who held him faithfully;&#10;and they were so high in the air that woods and fields, rivers and&#10;lakes, as they lay beneath them, looked like a painted&#10;map.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Good morning,&#34; said the East Wind. &#34;You might have slept&#10;on a while; for there is very little to see in the flat country&#10;over which we are passing unless you like to count the churches;&#10;they look like spots of chalk on a green board.&#34; The green board&#10;was the name he gave to the green fields and meadows.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It was very rude of me not to say good-bye to your mother&#10;and your brothers,&#34; said the prince.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;They will excuse you, as you were asleep,&#34; said the East&#10;Wind; and then they flew on faster than ever.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The leaves and branches of the trees rustled as they&#10;passed. When they flew over seas and lakes, the waves rose higher,&#10;and the large ships dipped into the water like diving swans. As&#10;darkness came on, towards evening, the great towns looked charming;&#10;lights were sparkling, now seen now hidden, just as the sparks go&#10;out one after another on a piece of burnt paper. The prince clapped&#10;his hands with pleasure; but the East Wind advised him not to&#10;express his admiration in that manner, or he might fall down, and&#10;find himself hanging on a church steeple. The eagle in the dark&#10;forests flies swiftly; but faster than he flew the East Wind. The&#10;Cossack, on his small horse, rides lightly o&#39;er the plains; but&#10;lighter still passed the prince on the winds of the&#10;wind.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;There are the Himalayas, the highest mountains in Asia,&#34;&#10;said the East Wind. &#34;We shall soon reach the garden of paradise&#10;now.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then, they turned southward, and the air became fragrant&#10;with the perfume of spices and flowers. Here figs and pomegranates&#10;grew wild, and the vines were covered with clusters of blue and&#10;purple grapes. Here they both descended to the earth, and stretched&#10;themselves on the soft grass, while the flowers bowed to the breath&#10;of the wind as if to welcome it. &#34;Are we now in the garden of&#10;paradise?&#34; asked the prince.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No, indeed,&#34; replied the East Wind; &#34;but we shall be&#10;there very soon. Do you see that wall of rocks, and the cavern&#10;beneath it, over which the grape vines hang like a green curtain?&#10;Through that cavern we must pass. Wrap your cloak round you; for&#10;while the sun scorches you here, a few steps farther it will be icy&#10;cold. The bird flying past the entrance to the cavern feels as if&#10;one wing were in the region of summer, and the other in the depths&#10;of winter.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;So this then is the way to the garden of paradise?&#34; asked&#10;the prince, as they entered the cavern. It was indeed cold; but the&#10;cold soon passed, for the East Wind spread his wings, and they&#10;gleamed like the brightest fire. As they passed on through this&#10;wonderful cave, the prince could see great blocks of stone, from&#10;which water trickled, hanging over their heads in fantastic shapes.&#10;Sometimes it was so narrow that they had to creep on their hands&#10;and knees, while at other times it was lofty and wide, like the&#10;free air. It had the appearance of a chapel for the dead, with&#10;petrified organs and silent pipes. &#34;We seem to be passing through&#10;the valley of death to the garden of paradise,&#34; said the&#10;prince.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But the East Wind answered not a word, only pointed&#10;forwards to a lovely blue light which gleamed in the distance. The&#10;blocks of stone assumed a misty appearance, till at last they&#10;looked like white clouds in moonlight. The air was fresh and balmy,&#10;like a breeze from the mountains perfumed with flowers from a&#10;valley of roses. A river, clear as the air itself, sparkled at&#10;their feet, while in its clear depths could be seen gold and silver&#10;fish sporting in the bright water, and purple eels emitting sparks&#10;of fire at every moment, while the broad leaves of the&#10;water-lilies, that floated on its surface, flickered with all the&#10;colors of the rainbow. The flower in its color of flame seemed to&#10;receive its nourishment from the water, as a lamp is sustained by&#10;oil. A marble bridge, of such exquisite workmanship that it&#10;appeared as if formed of lace and pearls, led to the island of&#10;happiness, in which bloomed the garden of paradise. The East Wind&#10;took the prince in his arms, and carried him over, while the&#10;flowers and the leaves sang the sweet songs of his childhood in&#10;tones so full and soft that no human voice could venture to&#10;imitate. Within the garden grew large trees, full of sap; but&#10;whether they were palm-trees or gigantic water-plants, the prince&#10;knew not. The climbing plants hung in garlands of green and gold,&#10;like the illuminations on the margins of old missals or twined&#10;among the initial letters. Birds, flowers, and festoons appeared&#10;intermingled in seeming confusion. Close by, on the grass, stood a&#10;group of peacocks, with radiant tails outspread to the sun. The&#10;prince touched them, and found, to his surprise, that they were not&#10;really birds, but the leaves of the burdock tree, which shone with&#10;the colors of a peacock&#39;s tail. The lion and the tiger, gentle and&#10;tame, were springing about like playful cats among the green&#10;bushes, whose perfume was like the fragrant blossom of the olive.&#10;The plumage of the wood-pigeon glistened like pearls as it struck&#10;the lion&#39;s mane with its wings; while the antelope, usually so shy,&#10;stood near, nodding its head as if it wished to join in the frolic.&#10;The fairy of paradise next made her appearance. Her raiment shone&#10;like the sun, and her serene countenance beamed with happiness like&#10;that of a mother rejoicing over her child. She was young and&#10;beautiful, and a train of lovely maidens followed her, each wearing&#10;a bright star in her hair. The East Wind gave her the palm-leaf, on&#10;which was written the history of the phoenix; and her eyes sparkled&#10;with joy. She then took the prince by the hand, and led him into&#10;her palace, the walls of which were richly colored, like a&#10;tulip-leaf when it is turned to the sun. The roof had the&#10;appearance of an inverted flower, and the colors grew deeper and&#10;brighter to the gazer. The prince walked to a window, and saw what&#10;appeared to be the tree of knowledge of good and evil, with Adam&#10;and Eve standing by, and the serpent near them. &#34;I thought they&#10;were banished from paradise,&#34; he said.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The princess smiled, and told him that time had engraved&#10;each event on a window-pane in the form of a picture; but, unlike&#10;other pictures, all that it represented lived and moved,&#8212;the leaves&#10;rustled, and the persons went and came, as in a looking-glass. He&#10;looked through another pane, and saw the ladder in Jacob&#39;s dream,&#10;on which the angels were ascending and descending with outspread&#10;wings. All that had ever happened in the world here lived and moved&#10;on the panes of glass, in pictures such as time alone could&#10;produce. The fairy now led the prince into a large, lofty room with&#10;transparent walls, through which the light shone. Here were&#10;portraits, each one appearing more beautiful than the&#10;other&#8212;millions of happy beings, whose laughter and song mingled in&#10;one sweet melody: some of these were in such an elevated position&#10;that they appeared smaller than the smallest rosebud, or like&#10;pencil dots on paper. In the centre of the hall stood a tree, with&#10;drooping branches, from which hung golden apples, both great and&#10;small, looking like oranges amid the green leaves. It was the tree&#10;of knowledge of good and evil, from which Adam and Eve had plucked&#10;and eaten the forbidden fruit, and from each leaf trickled a bright&#10;red dewdrop, as if the tree were weeping tears of blood for their&#10;sin. &#34;Let us now take the boat,&#34; said the fairy: &#34;a sail on the&#10;cool waters will refresh us. But we shall not move from the spot,&#10;although the boat may rock on the swelling water; the countries of&#10;the world will glide before us, but we shall remain&#10;still.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was indeed wonderful to behold. First came the lofty&#10;Alps, snow-clad, and covered with clouds and dark pines. The horn&#10;resounded, and the shepherds sang merrily in the valleys. The&#10;banana-trees bent their drooping branches over the boat, black&#10;swans floated on the water, and singular animals and flowers&#10;appeared on the distant shore. New Holland, the fifth division of&#10;the world, now glided by, with mountains in the background, looking&#10;blue in the distance. They heard the song of the priests, and saw&#10;the wild dance of the savage to the sound of the drums and trumpets&#10;of bone; the pyramids of Egypt rising to the clouds; columns and&#10;sphinxes, overthrown and buried in the sand, followed in their&#10;turn; while the northern lights flashed out over the extinguished&#10;volcanoes of the north, in fireworks none could imitate.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The prince was delighted, and yet he saw hundreds of other&#10;wonderful things more than can be described. &#34;Can I stay here&#10;forever?&#34; asked he.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That depends upon yourself,&#34; replied the fairy. &#34;If you&#10;do not, like Adam, long for what is forbidden, you can remain here&#10;always.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I should not touch the fruit on the tree of knowledge,&#34;&#10;said the prince; there is abundance of fruit equally&#10;beautiful.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Examine your own heart,&#34; said the princess, &#34;and if you&#10;do not feel sure of its strength, return with the East Wind who&#10;brought you. He is about to fly back, and will not return here for&#10;a hundred years. The time will not seem to you more than a hundred&#10;hours, yet even that is a long time for temptation and resistance.&#10;Every evening, when I leave you, I shall be obliged to say, &#39;Come&#10;with me,&#39; and to beckon to you with my hand. But you must not&#10;listen, nor move from your place to follow me; for with every step&#10;you will find your power to resist weaker. If once you attempted to&#10;follow me, you would soon find yourself in the hall, where grows&#10;the tree of knowledge, for I sleep beneath its perfumed branches.&#10;If you stooped over me, I should be forced to smile. If you then&#10;kissed my lips, the garden of paradise would sink into the earth,&#10;and to you it would be lost. A keen wind from the desert would howl&#10;around you; cold rain fall on your head, and sorrow and woe be your&#10;future lot.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I will remain,&#34; said the prince.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;So the East Wind kissed him on the forehead, and said, &#34;Be&#10;firm; then shall we meet again when a hundred years have passed.&#10;Farewell, farewell.&#34; Then the East Wind spread his broad pinions,&#10;which shone like the lightning in harvest, or as the northern&#10;lights in a cold winter.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Farewell, farewell,&#34; echoed the trees and the&#10;flowers.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Storks and pelicans flew after him in feathery bands, to&#10;accompany him to the boundaries of the garden.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Now we will commence dancing,&#34; said the fairy; and when&#10;it is nearly over at sunset, while I am dancing with you, I shall&#10;make a sign, and ask you to follow me: but do not obey. I shall be&#10;obliged to repeat the same thing for a hundred years; and each&#10;time, when the trial is past, if you resist, you will gain&#10;strength, till resistance becomes easy, and at last the temptation&#10;will be quite overcome. This evening, as it will be the first time,&#10;I have warned you.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;After this the fairy led him into a large hall, filled&#10;with transparent lilies. The yellow stamina of each flower formed a&#10;tiny golden harp, from which came forth strains of music like the&#10;mingled tones of flute and lyre. Beautiful maidens, slender and&#10;graceful in form, and robed in transparent gauze, floated through&#10;the dance, and sang of the happy life in the garden of paradise,&#10;where death never entered, and where all would bloom forever in&#10;immortal youth. As the sun went down, the whole heavens became&#10;crimson and gold, and tinted the lilies with the hue of roses. Then&#10;the beautiful maidens offered to the prince sparkling wine; and&#10;when he had drank, he felt happiness greater than he had ever known&#10;before. Presently the background of the hall opened and the tree of&#10;knowledge appeared, surrounded by a halo of glory that almost&#10;blinded him. Voices, soft and lovely as his mother&#39;s sounded in his&#10;ears, as if she were singing to him, &#34;My child, my beloved child.&#34;&#10;Then the fairy beckoned to him, and said in sweet accents, &#34;Come&#10;with me, come with me.&#34; Forgetting his promise, forgetting it even&#10;on the very first evening, he rushed towards her, while she&#10;continued to beckon to him and to smile. The fragrance around him&#10;overpowered his senses, the music from the harps sounded more&#10;entrancing, while around the tree appeared millions of smiling&#10;faces, nodding and singing. &#34;Man should know everything; man is the&#10;lord of the earth.&#34; The tree of knowledge no longer wept tears of&#10;blood, for the dewdrops shone like glittering stars.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Come, come,&#34; continued that thrilling voice, and the&#10;prince followed the call. At every step his cheeks glowed, and the&#10;blood rushed wildly through his veins. &#34;I must follow,&#34; he cried;&#10;&#34;it is not a sin, it cannot be, to follow beauty and joy. I only&#10;want to see her sleep, and nothing will happen unless I kiss her,&#10;and that I will not do, for I have strength to resist, and a&#10;determined will.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The fairy threw off her dazzling attire, bent back the&#10;boughs, and in another moment was hidden among them.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I have not sinned yet,&#34; said the prince, &#34;and I will&#10;not;&#34; and then he pushed aside the boughs to follow the princess.&#10;She was lying already asleep, beautiful as only a fairy in the&#10;garden of paradise could be. She smiled as he bent over her, and he&#10;saw tears trembling out of her beautiful eyelashes. &#34;Do you weep&#10;for me?&#34; he whispered. &#34;Oh weep not, thou loveliest of women. Now&#10;do I begin to understand the happiness of paradise; I feel it to my&#10;inmost soul, in every thought. A new life is born within me. One&#10;moment of such happiness is worth an eternity of darkness and woe.&#34;&#10;He stooped and kissed the tears from her eyes, and touched her lips&#10;with his.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A clap of thunder, loud and awful, resounded through the&#10;trembling air. All around him fell into ruin. The lovely fairy, the&#10;beautiful garden, sunk deeper and deeper. The prince saw it sinking&#10;down in the dark night till it shone only like a star in the&#10;distance beneath him. Then he felt a coldness, like death, creeping&#10;over him; his eyes closed, and he became insensible.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;When he recovered, a chilling rain was beating upon him,&#10;and a sharp wind blew on his head. &#34;Alas! what have I done?&#34; he&#10;sighed; &#34;I have sinned like Adam, and the garden of paradise has&#10;sunk into the earth.&#34; He opened his eyes, and saw the star in the&#10;distance, but it was the morning star in heaven which glittered in&#10;the darkness.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Presently he stood up and found himself in the depths of&#10;the forest, close to the cavern of the Winds, and the mother of the&#10;Winds sat by his side. She looked angry, and raised her arm in the&#10;air as she spoke. &#34;The very first evening!&#34; she said. &#34;Well, I&#10;expected it! If you were my son, you should go into the&#10;sack.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And there he will have to go at last,&#34; said a strong old&#10;man, with large black wings, and a scythe in his hand, whose name&#10;was Death. &#34;He shall be laid in his coffin, but not yet. I will&#10;allow him to wander about the world for a while, to atone for his&#10;sin, and to give him time to become better. But I shall return when&#10;he least expects me. I shall lay him in a black coffin, place it on&#10;my head, and fly away with it beyond the stars. There also blooms a&#10;garden of paradise, and if he is good and pious he will be&#10;admitted; but if his thoughts are bad, and his heart is full of&#10;sin, he will sink with his coffin deeper than the garden of&#10;paradise has sunk. Once in every thousand years I shall go and&#10;fetch him, when he will either be condemned to sink still deeper,&#10;or be raised to a happier life in the world beyond the&#10;stars.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Pea Blossom'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;THERE were once five peas in one shell, they were green,&#10;the shell was green, and so they believed that the whole world must&#10;be green also, which was a very natural conclusion. The shell grew,&#10;and the peas grew, they accommodated themselves to their position,&#10;and sat all in a row. The sun shone without and warmed the shell,&#10;and the rain made it clear and transparent; it was mild and&#10;agreeable in broad daylight, and dark at night, as it generally is;&#10;and the peas as they sat there grew bigger and bigger, and more&#10;thoughtful as they mused, for they felt there must be something&#10;else for them to do.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Are we to sit here forever?&#34; asked one; &#34;shall we not&#10;become hard by sitting so long? It seems to me there must be&#10;something outside, and I feel sure of it.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And as weeks passed by, the peas became yellow, and the&#10;shell became yellow.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;All the world is turning yellow, I suppose,&#34; said&#10;they,&#8212;and perhaps they were right.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Suddenly they felt a pull at the shell; it was torn off,&#10;and held in human hands, then slipped into the pocket of a jacket&#10;in company with other full pods.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Now we shall soon be opened,&#34; said one,&#8212;just what they&#10;all wanted.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I should like to know which of us will travel furthest,&#34;&#10;said the smallest of the five; &#34;we shall soon see now.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What is to happen will happen,&#34; said the largest&#10;pea.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Crack&#34; went the shell as it burst, and the five peas&#10;rolled out into the bright sunshine. There they lay in a child&#39;s&#10;hand. A little boy was holding them tightly, and said they were&#10;fine peas for his pea-shooter. And immediately he put one in and&#10;shot it out.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Now I am flying out into the wide world,&#34; said he; &#34;catch&#10;me if you can;&#34; and he was gone in a moment.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I,&#34; said the second, &#34;intend to fly straight to the sun,&#10;that is a shell that lets itself be seen, and it will suit me&#10;exactly;&#34; and away he went.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;We will go to sleep wherever we find ourselves,&#34; said the&#10;two next, &#34;we shall still be rolling onwards;&#34; and they did&#10;certainly fall on the floor, and roll about before they got into&#10;the pea-shooter; but they were put in for all that. &#34;We shall go&#10;farther than the others,&#34; said they.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What is to happen will happen,&#34; exclaimed the last, as he&#10;was shot out of the pea-shooter; and as he spoke he flew up against&#10;an old board under a garret-window, and fell into a little crevice,&#10;which was almost filled up with moss and soft earth. The moss&#10;closed itself round him, and there he lay, a captive indeed, but&#10;not unnoticed by God.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What is to happen will happen,&#34; said he to&#10;himself.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Within the little garret lived a poor woman, who went out&#10;to clean stoves, chop wood into small pieces and perform such-like&#10;hard work, for she was strong and industrious. Yet she remained&#10;always poor, and at home in the garret lay her only daughter, not&#10;quite grown up, and very delicate and weak. For a whole year she&#10;had kept her bed, and it seemed as if she could neither live nor&#10;die.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;She is going to her little sister,&#34; said the woman; &#34;I&#10;had but the two children, and it was not an easy thing to support&#10;both of them; but the good God helped me in my work, and took one&#10;of them to Himself and provided for her. Now I would gladly keep&#10;the other that was left to me, but I suppose they are not to be&#10;separated, and my sick girl will very soon go to her sister above.&#34;&#10;But the sick girl still remained where she was, quietly and&#10;patiently she lay all the day long, while her mother was away from&#10;home at her work.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Spring came, and one morning early the sun shone brightly&#10;through the little window, and threw its rays over the floor of the&#10;room. just as the mother was going to her work, the sick girl fixed&#10;her gaze on the lowest pane of the window&#8212;&#34;Mother,&#34; she exclaimed,&#10;&#34;what can that little green thing be that peeps in at the window?&#10;It is moving in the wind.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The mother stepped to the window and half opened it. &#34;Oh!&#34;&#10;she said, there is actually a little pea which has taken root and&#10;is putting out its green leaves. How could it have got into this&#10;crack? Well now, here is a little garden for you to amuse yourself&#10;with.&#34; So the bed of the sick girl was drawn nearer to the window,&#10;that she might see the budding plant; and the mother went out to&#10;her work.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Mother, I believe I shall get well,&#34; said the sick child&#10;in the evening, &#34;the sun has shone in here so brightly and warmly&#10;to-day, and the little pea is thriving so well: I shall get on&#10;better, too, and go out into the warm sunshine again.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;God grant it!&#34; said the mother, but she did not believe&#10;it would be so. But she propped up with the little stick the green&#10;plant which had given her child such pleasant hopes of life, so&#10;that it might not be broken by the winds; she tied the piece of&#10;string to the window-sill and to the upper part of the frame, so&#10;that the pea-tendrils might twine round it when it shot up. And it&#10;did shoot up, indeed it might almost be seen to grow from day to&#10;day.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Now really here is a flower coming,&#34; said the old woman&#10;one morning, and now at last she began to encourage the hope that&#10;her sick daughter might really recover. She remembered that for&#10;some time the child had spoken more cheerfully, and during the last&#10;few days had raised herself in bed in the morning to look with&#10;sparkling eyes at her little garden which contained only a single&#10;pea-plant. A week after, the invalid sat up for the first time a&#10;whole hour, feeling quite happy by the open window in the warm&#10;sunshine, while outside grew the little plant, and on it a pink&#10;pea-blossom in full bloom. The little maiden bent down and gently&#10;kissed the delicate leaves. This day was to her like a&#10;festival.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Our heavenly Father Himself has planted that pea, and&#10;made it grow and flourish, to bring joy to you and hope to me, my&#10;blessed child,&#34; said the happy mother, and she smiled at the&#10;flower, as if it had been an angel from God.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But what became of the other peas? Why the one who flew&#10;out into the wide world, and said, &#34;Catch me if you can,&#34; fell into&#10;a gutter on the roof of a house, and ended his travels in the crop&#10;of a pigeon. The two lazy ones were carried quite as far, for they&#10;also were eaten by pigeons, so they were at least of some use; but&#10;the fourth, who wanted to reach the sun, fell into a sink and lay&#10;there in the dirty water for days and weeks, till he had swelled to&#10;a great size.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I am getting beautifully fat,&#34; said the pea, &#34;I expect I&#10;shall burst at last; no pea could do more that that, I think; I am&#10;the most remarkable of all the five which were in the shell.&#34; And&#10;the sink confirmed the opinion.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But the young maiden stood at the open garret window, with&#10;sparkling eyes and the rosy hue of health on her cheeks, she folded&#10;her thin hands over the pea-blossom, and thanked God for what He&#10;had done.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I,&#34; said the sink, &#34;shall stand up for my&#10;pea.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)

What will come next? It is indeed&#10;wonderful.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, certainly,&#34; said the inkstand to the pen, and to the&#10;other articles that stood on the table; &#34;that&#39;s what I always say.&#10;It is wonderful and extraordinary what a number of things come out&#10;of me. It&#39;s quite incredible, and I really don&#39;t know what is&#10;coming next when that man dips his pen into me. One drop out of me&#10;is enough for half a page of paper, and what cannot half a page&#10;contain? From me, all the works of a poet are produced; all those&#10;imaginary characters whom people fancy they have known or met. All&#10;the deep feeling, the humor, and the vivid pictures of nature. I&#10;myself don&#39;t understand how it is, for I am not acquainted with&#10;nature, but it is certainly in me. From me have gone forth to the&#10;world those wonderful descriptions of troops of charming maidens,&#10;and of brave knights on prancing steeds; of the halt and the blind,&#10;and I know not what more, for I assure you I never think of these&#10;things.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;There you are right,&#34; said the pen, &#34;for you don&#39;t think&#10;at all; if you did, you would see that you can only provide the&#10;means. You give the fluid that I may place upon the paper what&#10;dwells in me, and what I wish to bring to light. It is the pen that&#10;writes: no man doubts that; and, indeed, most people understand as&#10;much about poetry as an old inkstand.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You have had very little experience,&#34; replied the&#10;inkstand. &#34;You have hardly been in service a week, and are already&#10;half worn out. Do you imagine you are a poet? You are only a&#10;servant, and before you came I had many like you, some of the goose&#10;family, and others of English manufacture. I know a quill pen as&#10;well as I know a steel one. I have had both sorts in my service,&#10;and I shall have many more when he comes&#8212;the man who performs the&#10;mechanical part&#8212;and writes down what he obtains from me. I should&#10;like to know what will be the next thing he gets out of&#10;me.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Inkpot!&#34; exclaimed the pen contemptuously.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Late in the evening the poet came home. He had been to a&#10;concert, and had been quite enchanted with the admirable&#10;performance of a famous violin player whom he had heard there. The&#10;performer had produced from his instrument a richness of tone that&#10;sometimes sounded like tinkling waterdrops or rolling pearls;&#10;sometimes like the birds twittering in chorus, and then rising and&#10;swelling in sound like the wind through the fir-trees. The poet&#10;felt as if his own heart were weeping, but in tones of melody like&#10;the sound of a woman&#39;s voice. It seemed not only the strings, but&#10;every part of the instrument from which these sounds were produced.&#10;It was a wonderful performance and a difficult piece, and yet the&#10;bow seemed to glide across the strings so easily that it was as if&#10;any one could do it who tried. Even the violin and the bow appeared&#10;to perform independently of their master who guided them; it was as&#10;if soul and spirit had been breathed into the instrument, so the&#10;audience forgot the performer in the beautiful sounds he produced.&#10;Not so the poet; he remembered him, and named him, and wrote down&#10;his thoughts on the subject. &#34;How foolish it would be for the&#10;violin and the bow to boast of their performance, and yet we men&#10;often commit that folly. The poet, the artist, the man of science&#10;in his laboratory, the general,&#8212;we all do it; and yet we are only&#10;the instruments which the Almighty uses; to Him alone the honor is&#10;due. We have nothing of ourselves of which we should be proud.&#34;&#10;Yes, this is what the poet wrote down. He wrote it in the form of a&#10;parable, and called it &#34;The Master and the Instruments.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That is what you have got, madam,&#34; said the pen to the&#10;inkstand, when the two were alone again. &#34;Did you hear him read&#10;aloud what I had written down?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, what I gave you to write,&#34; retorted the inkstand.&#10;&#34;That was a cut at you because of your conceit. To think that you&#10;could not understand that you were being quizzed. I gave you a cut&#10;from within me. Surely I must know my own satire.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ink-pitcher!&#34; cried the pen.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Writing-stick!&#34; retorted the inkstand. And each of them&#10;felt satisfied that he had given a good answer. It is pleasing to&#10;be convinced that you have settled a matter by your reply; it is&#10;something to make you sleep well, and they both slept well upon it.&#10;But the poet did not sleep. Thoughts rose up within him like the&#10;tones of the violin, falling like pearls, or rushing like the&#10;strong wind through the forest. He understood his own heart in&#10;these thoughts; they were as a ray from the mind of the Great&#10;Master of all minds.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;To Him be all the honor.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)

Here, in the first rose, a bird was born. His&#10;flight was like the flashing of light, his plumage was beauteous,&#10;and his song ravishing. But when Eve plucked the fruit of the tree&#10;of knowledge of good and evil, when she and Adam were driven from&#10;Paradise, there fell from the flaming sword of the cherub a spark&#10;into the nest of the bird, which blazed up forthwith. The bird&#10;perished in the flames; but from the red egg in the nest there&#10;fluttered aloft a new one&#8212;the one solitary Phoenix bird. The fable&#10;tells that he dwells in Arabia, and that every hundred years, he&#10;burns himself to death in his nest; but each time a new Phoenix,&#10;the only one in the world, rises up from the red egg.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The bird flutters round us, swift as light, beauteous in&#10;color, charming in song. When a mother sits by her infant&#39;s cradle,&#10;he stands on the pillow, and, with his wings, forms a glory around&#10;the infant&#39;s head. He flies through the chamber of content, and&#10;brings sunshine into it, and the violets on the humble table smell&#10;doubly sweet.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But the Phoenix is not the bird of Arabia alone. He wings&#10;his way in the glimmer of the Northern Lights over the plains of&#10;Lapland, and hops among the yellow flowers in the short Greenland&#10;summer. Beneath the copper mountains of Fablun, and England&#39;s coal&#10;mines, he flies, in the shape of a dusty moth, over the hymnbook&#10;that rests on the knees of the pious miner. On a lotus leaf he&#10;floats down the sacred waters of the Ganges, and the eye of the&#10;Hindoo maid gleams bright when she beholds him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Phoenix bird, dost thou not know him? The Bird of&#10;Paradise, the holy swan of song! On the car of Thespis he sat in&#10;the guise of a chattering raven, and flapped his black wings,&#10;smeared with the lees of wine; over the sounding harp of Iceland&#10;swept the swan&#39;s red beak; on Shakspeare&#39;s shoulder he sat in the&#10;guise of Odin&#39;s raven, and whispered in the poet&#39;s ear&#10;&#34;Immortality!&#34; and at the minstrels&#39; feast he fluttered through the&#10;halls of the Wartburg.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Phoenix bird, dost thou not know him? He sang to thee&#10;the Marseillaise, and thou kissedst the pen that fell from his&#10;wing; he came in the radiance of Paradise, and perchance thou didst&#10;turn away from him towards the sparrow who sat with tinsel on his&#10;wings.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Bird of Paradise&#8212;renewed each century&#8212;born in flame,&#10;ending in flame!

The earth wears a snowy garment, and&#10;looks like marble hewn out of the rock; the air is bright and&#10;clear; the wind is sharp as a well-tempered sword, and the trees&#10;stand like branches of white coral or blooming almond twigs, and&#10;here it is keen as on the lofty Alps.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The night is splendid in the gleam of the Northern Lights,&#10;and in the glitter of innumerable twinkling stars.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But we sit in the warm room, by the hot stove, and talk&#10;about the old times. And we listen to this story:&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;By the open sea was a giant&#39;s grave; and on the&#10;grave-mound sat at midnight the spirit of the buried hero, who had&#10;been a king. The golden circlet gleamed on his brow, his hair&#10;fluttered in the wind, and he was clad in steel and iron. He bent&#10;his head mournfully, and sighed in deep sorrow, as an unquiet&#10;spirit might sigh.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And a ship came sailing by. Presently the sailors lowered&#10;the anchor and landed. Among them was a singer, and he approached&#10;the royal spirit, and said,&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Why mournest thou, and wherefore dost thou suffer&#10;thus?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the dead man answered,&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No one has sung the deeds of my life; they are dead and&#10;forgotten. Song doth not carry them forth over the lands, nor into&#10;the hearts of men; therefore I have no rest and no&#10;peace.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And he spoke of his works, and of his warlike deeds, which&#10;his contemporaries had known, but which had not been sung, because&#10;there was no singer among his companions.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the old bard struck the strings of his harp, and sang&#10;of the youthful courage of the hero, of the strength of the man,&#10;and of the greatness of his good deeds. Then the face of the dead&#10;one gleamed like the margin of the cloud in the moonlight. Gladly&#10;and of good courage, the form arose in splendor and in majesty, and&#10;vanished like the glancing of the northern light. Nought was to be&#10;seen but the green turfy mound, with the stones on which no Runic&#10;record has been graven; but at the last sound of the harp there&#10;soared over the hill, as though he had fluttered from the harp, a&#10;little bird, a charming singing-bird, with ringing voice of the&#10;thrush, with the moving voice pathos of the human heart, with a&#10;voice that told of home, like the voice that is heard by the bird&#10;of passage. The singing-bird soared away, over mountain and valley,&#10;over field and wood&#8212;he was the Bird of Popular Song, who never&#10;dies.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;We hear his song&#8212;we hear it now in the room while the&#10;white bees are swarming without, and the storm clutches the&#10;windows. The bird sings not alone the requiem of heroes; he sings&#10;also sweet gentle songs of love, so many and so warm, of Northern&#10;fidelity and truth. He has stories in words and in tones; he has&#10;proverbs and snatches of proverbs; songs which, like Runes laid&#10;under a dead man&#39;s tongue, force him to speak; and thus Popular&#10;Song tells of the land of his birth.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the old heathen days, in the times of the Vikings, the&#10;popular speech was enshrined in the harp of the bard.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the days of knightly castles, when the strongest fist&#10;held the scales of justice, when only might was right, and a&#10;peasant and a dog were of equal importance, where did the Bird of&#10;Song find shelter and protection? Neither violence nor stupidity&#10;gave him a thought.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But in the gabled window of the knightly castle, the lady&#10;of the castle sat with the parchment roll before her, and wrote&#10;down the old recollections in song and legend, while near her stood&#10;the old woman from the wood, and the travelling peddler who went&#10;wandering through the country. As these told their tales, there&#10;fluttered around them, with twittering and song, the Bird of&#10;Popular Song, who never dies so long as the earth has a hill upon&#10;which his foot may rest.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And now he looks in upon us and sings. Without are the&#10;night and the snow-storm. He lays the Runes beneath our tongues,&#10;and we know the land of our home. Heaven speaks to us in our native&#10;tongue, in the voice of the Bird of Popular Song. The old&#10;remembrances awake, the faded colors glow with a fresh lustre, and&#10;story and song pour us a blessed draught which lifts up our minds&#10;and our thoughts, so that the evening becomes as a Christmas&#10;festival.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The snow-flakes chase each other, the ice cracks, the&#10;storm rules without, for he has the might, he is lord&#8212;but not the&#10;LORD OF ALL.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It is winter time. The wind is sharp as a two-edged sword,&#10;the snow-flakes chase each other; it seems as though it had been&#10;snowing for days and weeks, and the snow lies like a great mountain&#10;over the whole town, like a heavy dream of the winter night.&#10;Everything on the earth is hidden away, only the golden cross of&#10;the church, the symbol of faith, arises over the snow grave, and&#10;gleams in the blue air and in the bright sunshine.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And over the buried town fly the birds of heaven, the&#10;small and the great; they twitter and they sing as best they may,&#10;each bird with his beak.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;First comes the band of sparrows: they pipe at every&#10;trifle in the streets and lanes, in the nests and the houses; they&#10;have stories to tell about the front buildings and the back&#10;buildings.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;We know the buried town,&#34; they say; &#34;everything living in&#10;it is piep! piep! piep!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The black ravens and crows flew on over the white&#10;snow.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Grub, grub!&#34; they cried. &#34;There&#39;s something to be got&#10;down there; something to swallow, and that&#39;s most important. That&#39;s&#10;the opinion of most of them down there, and the opinion is&#10;goo-goo-good!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The wild swans come flying on whirring pinions, and sing&#10;of the noble and the great, that will still sprout in the hearts of&#10;men, down in the town which is resting beneath its snowy&#10;veil.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;No death is there&#8212;life reigns yonder; we hear it on the&#10;notes that swell onward like the tones of the church organ, which&#10;seize us like sounds from the elf-hill, like the songs of Ossian,&#10;like the rushing swoop of the wandering spirits&#39; wings. What&#10;harmony! That harmony speaks to our hearts, and lifts up our souls!&#10;It is the Bird of Popular Song whom we hear.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And at this moment the warm breath of heaven blows down&#10;from the sky. There are gaps in the snowy mountains, the sun shines&#10;into the clefts; spring is coming, the birds are returning, and new&#10;races are coming with the same home sounds in their&#10;hearts.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Hear the story of the year: &#34;The night of the snow-storm,&#10;the heavy dream of the winter night, all shall be dissolved, all&#10;shall rise again in the beauteous notes of the Bird of Popular&#10;Song, who never dies!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Portuguese Duck'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A DUCK once arrived from Portugal, but there were some who&#10;said she came from Spain, which is almost the same thing. At all&#10;events, she was called the &#34;Portuguese,&#34; and she laid eggs, was&#10;killed, and cooked, and there was an end of her. But the ducklings&#10;which crept forth from the eggs were also called &#34;Portuguese,&#34; and&#10;about that there may be some question. But of all the family one&#10;only remained in the duckyard, which may be called a farmyard, as&#10;the chickens were admitted, and the cock strutted about in a very&#10;hostile manner. &#34;He annoys me with his loud crowing,&#34; said the&#10;Portuguese duck; &#34;but, still, he&#39;s a handsome bird, there&#39;s no&#10;denying that, although he&#39;s not a drake. He ought to moderate his&#10;voice, like those little birds who are singing in the lime-trees&#10;over there in our neighbor&#39;s garden, but that is an art only&#10;acquired in polite society. How sweetly they sing there; it is&#10;quite a pleasure to listen to them! I call it Portuguese singing.&#10;If I had only such a little singing-bird, I&#39;d be kind and good as a&#10;mother to him, for it&#39;s in my nature, in my Portuguese&#10;blood.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;While she was speaking, one of the little singing-birds&#10;came tumbling head over heels from the roof into the yard. The cat&#10;was after him, but he had escaped from her with a broken wing, and&#10;so came tumbling into the yard. &#34;That&#39;s just like the cat, she&#39;s a&#10;villain,&#34; said the Portuguese duck. &#34;I remember her ways when I had&#10;children of my own. How can such a creature be allowed to live, and&#10;wander about upon the roofs. I don&#39;t think they allow such things&#10;in Portugal.&#34; She pitied the little singing-bird, and so did all&#10;the other ducks who were not Portuguese.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Poor little creature!&#34; they said, one after another, as&#10;they came up. &#34;We can&#39;t sing, certainly; but we have a&#10;sounding-board, or something of the kind, within us; we can feel&#10;that, though we don&#39;t talk about it.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But I can talk,&#34; said the Portuguese duck; &#34;and I&#39;ll do&#10;something for the little fellow; it&#39;s my duty;&#34; and she stepped&#10;into the water-trough, and beat her wings upon the water so&#10;strongly that the bird was nearly drowned by a shower-bath; but the&#10;duck meant it kindly. &#34;That is a good deed,&#34; she said; &#34;I hope the&#10;others will take example by it.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Tweet, tweet!&#34; said the little bird, for one of his wings&#10;being broken, he found it difficult to shake himself; but he quite&#10;understood that the bath was meant kindly, and he said, &#34;You are&#10;very kind-hearted, madam;&#34; but he did not wish for a second&#10;bath.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I have never thought about my heart,&#34; replied the&#10;Portuguese duck, &#34;but I know that I love all my fellow-creatures,&#10;except the cat, and nobody can expect me to love her, for she ate&#10;up two of my ducklings. But pray make yourself at home; it is easy&#10;to make one&#39;s self comfortable. I am myself from a foreign country,&#10;as you may see by my feathery dress. My drake is a native of these&#10;parts; he&#39;s not of my race; but I am not proud on that account. If&#10;any one here can understand you, I may say positively I am that&#10;person.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;She&#39;s quite full of &#39;Portulak,&#39;&#34; said a little common&#10;duck, who was witty. All the common ducks considered the word&#10;&#34;Portulak&#34; a good joke, for it sounded like Portugal. They nudged&#10;each other, and said, &#34;Quack! that was witty!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the other ducks began to notice the little bird. &#34;The&#10;Portuguese had certainly a great flow of language,&#34; they said to&#10;the little bird. &#34;For our part we don&#39;t care to fill our beaks with&#10;such long words, but we sympathize with you quite as much. If we&#10;don&#39;t do anything else, we can walk about with you everywhere, and&#10;we think that is the best thing we can do.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You have a lovely voice,&#34; said one of the eldest ducks;&#10;&#34;it must be great satisfaction to you to be able to give so much&#10;pleasure as you do. I am certainly no judge of your singing so I&#10;keep my beak shut, which is better than talking nonsense, as others&#10;do.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Don&#39;t plague him so, interposed the Portuguese duck; &#34;he&#10;requires rest and nursing. My little singing-bird do you wish me to&#10;prepare another bath for you?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, no! no! pray let me dry,&#34; implored the little&#10;bird.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The water-cure is the only remedy for me, when I am not&#10;well,&#34; said the Portuguese. &#34;Amusement, too, is very beneficial.&#10;The fowls from the neighborhood will soon be here to pay you a&#10;visit. There are two Cochin Chinese amongst them; they wear&#10;feathers on their legs, and are well educated. They have been&#10;brought from a great distance, and consequently I treat them with&#10;greater respect than I do the others.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the fowls arrived, and the cock was polite enough&#10;to-day to keep from being rude. &#34;You are a real songster,&#34; he said,&#10;&#34;you do as much with your little voice as it is possible to do; but&#10;there requires more noise and shrillness in any one who wishes it&#10;to be known who he is.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The two Chinese were quite enchanted with the appearance&#10;of the singing-bird. His feathers had been much ruffled by his&#10;bath, so that he seemed to them quite like a tiny Chinese fowl.&#10;&#34;He&#39;s charming,&#34; they said to each other, and began a conversation&#10;with him in whispers, using the most aristocratic Chinese dialect:&#10;&#34;We are of the same race as yourself,&#34; they said. &#34;The ducks, even&#10;the Portuguese, are all aquatic birds, as you must have noticed.&#10;You do not know us yet,&#8212;very few know us, or give themselves the&#10;trouble to make our acquaintance, not even any of the fowls, though&#10;we are born to occupy a higher grade in society than most of them.&#10;But that does not disturb us, we quietly go on in our own way among&#10;the rest, whose ideas are certainly not ours; for we look at the&#10;bright side of things, and only speak what is good, although that&#10;is sometimes very difficult to find where none exists. Except&#10;ourselves and the cock there is not one in the yard who can be&#10;called talented or polite. It cannot even be said of the ducks, and&#10;we warn you, little bird, not to trust that one yonder, with the&#10;short tail feathers, for she is cunning; that curiously marked one,&#10;with the crooked stripes on her wings, is a mischief-maker, and&#10;never lets any one have the last word, though she is always in the&#10;wrong. That fat duck yonder speaks evil of every one, and that is&#10;against our principles. If we have nothing good to tell, we close&#10;our beaks. The Portuguese is the only one who has had any&#10;education, and with whom we can associate, but she is passionate,&#10;and talks too much about &#39;Portugal.&#39;&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I wonder what those two Chinese are whispering about,&#34;&#10;whispered one duck to another; &#34;they are always doing it, and it&#10;annoys me. We never speak to them.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Now the drake came up, and he thought the little&#10;singing-bird was a sparrow. &#34;Well, I don&#39;t understand the&#10;difference,&#34; he said; &#34;it appears to me all the same. He&#39;s only a&#10;plaything, and if people will have playthings, why let them, I&#10;say.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Don&#39;t take any notice of what he says,&#34; whispered the&#10;Portuguese; &#34;he&#39;s very well in matters of business, and with him&#10;business is placed before everything. But now I shall lie down and&#10;have a little rest. It is a duty we owe to ourselves that we may be&#10;nice and fat when we come to be embalmed with sage and onions and&#10;apples.&#34; So she laid herself down in the sun and winked with one&#10;eye; she had a very comfortable place, and felt so comfortable that&#10;she fell asleep. The little singing-bird busied himself for some&#10;time with his broken wing, and at last he lay down, too, quite&#10;close to his protectress. The sun shone warm and bright, and he&#10;found out that it was a very good place. But the fowls of the&#10;neighborhood were all awake, and, to tell the truth, they had paid&#10;a visit to the duckyard, simply and solely to find food for&#10;themselves. The Chinese were the first to leave, and the other&#10;fowls soon followed them.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The witty little duck said of the Portuguese, that the old&#10;lady was getting quite a &#34;doting ducky,&#34; All the other ducks&#10;laughed at this. &#34;Doting ducky,&#34; they whispered. &#34;Oh, that&#39;s too&#10;&#39;witty!&#39;&#34; And then they repeated the former joke about &#34;Portulak,&#34;&#10;and declared it was most amusing. Then they all lay down to have a&#10;nap.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;They had been lying asleep for some time, when suddenly&#10;something was thrown into the yard for them to eat. It came down&#10;with such a bang, that the whole company started up and clapped&#10;their wings. The Portuguese awoke too, and rushed over to the other&#10;side: in so doing she trod upon the little singing-bird.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Tweet,&#34; he cried; &#34;you trod very hard upon me,&#10;madam.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Well, then, why do you lie in my way?&#34; she retorted, &#34;you&#10;must not be so touchy. I have nerves of my own, but I do not cry&#10;&#39;tweet.&#39;&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Don&#39;t be angry,&#34; said the little bird; &#34;the &#39;tweet&#39;&#10;slipped out of my beak unawares.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Portuguese did not listen to him, but began eating as&#10;fast as she could, and made a good meal. When she had finished, she&#10;lay down again, and the little bird, who wished to be amiable,&#10;began to sing,&#8212;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Chirp and twitter,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160; The dew-drops glitter,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;In the hours of sunny spring,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160; I&#39;ll sing my best,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160; Till I go to rest,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;With my head behind my wing.&#34;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Now I want rest after my dinner,&#34; said the Portuguese;&#10;&#34;you must conform to the rules of the house while you are here. I&#10;want to sleep now.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The little bird was quite taken aback, for he meant it&#10;kindly. When madam awoke afterwards, there he stood before her with&#10;a little corn he had found, and laid it at her feet; but as she had&#10;not slept well, she was naturally in a bad temper. &#34;Give that to a&#10;chicken,&#34; she said, &#34;and don&#39;t be always standing in my&#10;way.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Why are you angry with me?&#34; replied the little&#10;singing-bird, &#34;what have I done?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Done!&#34; repeated the Portuguese duck, &#34;your mode of&#10;expressing yourself is not very polite. I must call your attention&#10;to that fact.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It was sunshine here yesterday,&#34; said the little bird,&#10;&#34;but to-day it is cloudy and the air is close.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You know very little about the weather, I fancy,&#34; she&#10;retorted, &#34;the day is not over yet. Don&#39;t stand there, looking so&#10;stupid.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But you are looking at me just as the wicked eyes looked&#10;when I fell into the yard yesterday.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Impertinent creature!&#34; exclaimed the Portuguese duck:&#10;&#34;would you compare me with the cat&#8212;that beast of prey? There&#39;s not&#10;a drop of malicious blood in me. I&#39;ve taken your part, and now I&#39;ll&#10;teach you better manners.&#34; So saying, she made a bite at the little&#10;singing-bird&#39;s head, and he fell dead on the ground. &#34;Now whatever&#10;is the meaning of this?&#34; &#34;she said; &#34;could he not bear even such a&#10;little peck as I gave him? Then certainly he was not made for this&#10;world. I&#39;ve been like a mother to him, I know that, for I&#39;ve a good&#10;heart.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the cock from the neighboring yard stuck his head in,&#10;and crowed with steam-engine power.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You&#39;ll kill me with your crowing,&#34; she cried, &#34;it&#39;s all&#10;your fault. He&#39;s lost his life, and I&#39;m very near losing&#10;mine.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;There&#39;s not much of him lying there,&#34; observed the&#10;cock.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Speak of him with respect,&#34; said the Portuguese duck,&#10;&#34;for he had manners and education, and he could sing. He was&#10;affectionate and gentle, and that is as rare a quality in animals&#10;as in those who call themselves human beings.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then all the ducks came crowding round the little dead&#10;bird. Ducks have strong passions, whether they feel envy or pity.&#10;There was nothing to envy here, so they all showed a great deal of&#10;pity, even the two Chinese. &#34;We shall never have another&#10;singing-bird again amongst us; he was almost a Chinese,&#34; they&#10;whispered, and then they wept with such a noisy, clucking sound,&#10;that all the other fowls clucked too, but the ducks went about with&#10;redder eyes afterwards. &#34;We have hearts of our own,&#34; they said,&#10;&#34;nobody can deny that.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Hearts!&#34; repeated the Portuguese, &#34;indeed you have,&#10;almost as tender as the ducks in Portugal.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Let us think of getting something to satisfy our hunger,&#34;&#10;said the drake, that&#39;s the most important business. If one of our&#10;toys is broken, why we have plenty more.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Porter&#39;s Son'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;THE General lived in the grand first floor, and the porter&#10;lived in the cellar. There was a great distance between the two&#10;families&#8212;the whole of the ground floor, and the difference in rank;&#10;but they lived in the same house, and both had a view of the&#10;street, and of the courtyard. In the courtyard was a grass-plot, on&#10;which grew a blooming acacia tree (when it was in bloom), and under&#10;this tree sat occasionally the finely-dressed nurse, with the still&#10;more finely-dressed child of the General&#8212;little Emily. Before them&#10;danced about barefoot the little son of the porter, with his great&#10;brown eyes and dark hair; and the little girl smiled at him, and&#10;stretched out her hands towards him; and when the General saw that&#10;from the window, he would nod his head and cry, &#34;Charming!&#34; The&#10;General&#39;s lady (who was so young that she might very well have been&#10;her husband&#39;s daughter from an early marriage) never came to the&#10;window that looked upon the courtyard. She had given orders,&#10;though, that the boy might play his antics to amuse her child, but&#10;must never touch it. The nurse punctually obeyed the gracious&#10;lady&#39;s orders.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The sun shone in upon the people in the grand first floor,&#10;and upon the people in the cellar; the acacia tree was covered with&#10;blossoms, and they fell off, and next year new ones came. The tree&#10;bloomed, and the porter&#39;s little son bloomed too, and looked like a&#10;fresh tulip.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The General&#39;s little daughter became delicate and pale,&#10;like the leaf of the acacia blossom. She seldom came down to the&#10;tree now, for she took the air in a carriage. She drove out with&#10;her mamma, and then she would always nod at the porter&#39;s George;&#10;yes, she used even to kiss her hand to him, till her mamma said she&#10;was too old to do that now.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;One morning George was sent up to carry the General the&#10;letters and newspapers that had been delivered at the porter&#39;s room&#10;in the morning. As he was running up stairs, just as he passed the&#10;door of the sand-box, he heard a faint piping. He thought it was&#10;some young chicken that had strayed there, and was raising cries of&#10;distress; but it was the General&#39;s little daughter, decked out in&#10;lace and finery.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Don&#39;t tell papa and mamma,&#34; she whimpered; &#34;they would be&#10;angry.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What&#39;s the matter, little missie?&#34; asked&#10;George.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It&#39;s all on fire!&#34; she answered. &#34;It&#39;s burning with a&#10;bright flame!&#34; George hurried up stairs to the General&#39;s&#10;apartments; he opened the door of the nursery. The window curtain&#10;was almost entirely burnt, and the wooden curtain-pole was one mass&#10;of flame. George sprang upon a chair he brought in haste, and&#10;pulled down the burning articles; he then alarmed the people. But&#10;for him, the house would have been burned down.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The General and his lady cross-questioned little&#10;Emily.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I only took just one lucifer-match,&#34; she said, &#34;and it&#10;was burning directly, and the curtain was burning too. I spat at&#10;it, to put it out; I spat at it as much as ever I could, but I&#10;could not put it out; so I ran away and hid myself, for papa and&#10;mamma would be angry.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I spat!&#34; cried the General&#39;s lady; &#34;what an expression!&#10;Did you ever hear your papa and mamma talk about spitting? You must&#10;have got that from down stairs!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And George had a penny given him. But this penny did not&#10;go to the baker&#39;s shop, but into the savings-box; and soon there&#10;were so many pennies in the savings-box that he could buy a&#10;paint-box and color the drawings he made, and he had a great number&#10;of drawings. They seemed to shoot out of his pencil and out of his&#10;fingers&#39; ends. His first colored pictures he presented to&#10;Emily.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Charming!&#34; said the General, and even the General&#39;s lady&#10;acknowledged that it was easy to see what the boy had meant to&#10;draw. &#34;He has genius.&#34; Those were the words that were carried down&#10;into the cellar.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The General and his gracious lady were grand people. They&#10;had two coats of arms on their carriage, a coat of arms for each of&#10;them, and the gracious lady had had this coat of arms embroidered&#10;on both sides of every bit of linen she had, and even on her&#10;nightcap and her dressing-bag. One of the coats of arms, the one&#10;that belonged to her, was a very dear one; it had been bought for&#10;hard cash by her father, for he had not been born with it, nor had&#10;she; she had come into the world too early, seven years before the&#10;coat of arms, and most people remembered this circumstance, but the&#10;family did not remember it. A man might well have a bee in his&#10;bonnet, when he had such a coat of arms to carry as that, let alone&#10;having to carry two; and the General&#39;s wife had a bee in hers when&#10;she drove to the court ball, as stiff and as proud as you&#10;please.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The General was old and gray, but he had a good seat on&#10;horseback, and he knew it, and he rode out every day, with a groom&#10;behind him at a proper distance. When he came to a party, he looked&#10;somehow as if he were riding into the room upon his high horse; and&#10;he had orders, too, such a number that no one would have believed&#10;it; but that was not his fault. As a young man he had taken part in&#10;the great autumn reviews which were held in those days. He had an&#10;anecdote that he told about those days, the only one he knew. A&#10;subaltern under his orders had cut off one of the princes, and&#10;taken him prisoner, and the Prince had been obliged to ride through&#10;the town with a little band of captured soldiers, himself a&#10;prisoner behind the General. This was an ever-memorable event, and&#10;was always told over and over again every year by the General, who,&#10;moreover, always repeated the remarkable words he had used when he&#10;returned his sword to the Prince; those words were, &#34;Only my&#10;subaltern could have taken your Highness prisoner; I could never&#10;have done it!&#34; And the Prince had replied, &#34;You are incomparable.&#34;&#10;In a real war the General had never taken part. When war came into&#10;the country, he had gone on a diplomatic career to foreign courts.&#10;He spoke the French language so fluently that he had almost&#10;forgotten his own; he could dance well, he could ride well, and&#10;orders grew on his coat in an astounding way. The sentries&#10;presented arms to him, one of the most beautiful girls presented&#10;arms to him, and became the General&#39;s lady, and in time they had a&#10;pretty, charming child, that seemed as if it had dropped from&#10;heaven, it was so pretty; and the porter&#39;s son danced before it in&#10;the courtyard, as soon as it could understand it, and gave her all&#10;his colored pictures, and little Emily looked at them, and was&#10;pleased, and tore them to pieces. She was pretty and delicate&#10;indeed.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;My little Roseleaf!&#34; cried the General&#39;s lady, &#34;thou art&#10;born to wed a prince.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The prince was already at the door, but they knew nothing&#10;of it; people don&#39;t see far beyond the threshold.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The day before yesterday our boy divided his bread and&#10;butter with her!&#34; said the porter&#39;s wife. &#34;There was neither cheese&#10;nor meat upon it, but she liked it as well as if it had been roast&#10;beef. There would have been a fine noise if the General and his&#10;wife had seen the feast, but they did not see it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;George had divided his bread and butter with little Emily,&#10;and he would have divided his heart with her, if it would have&#10;pleased her. He was a good boy, brisk and clever, and he went to&#10;the night school in the Academy now, to learn to draw properly.&#10;Little Emily was getting on with her education too, for she spoke&#10;French with her &#34;bonne,&#34; and had a dancing master.&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;George will be confirmed at Easter,&#34; said the porter&#39;s&#10;wife; for George had got so far as this.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It would be the best thing, now, to make an apprentice of&#10;him,&#34; said his father. &#34;It must be to some good calling&#8212;and then he&#10;would be out of the house.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;He would have to sleep out of the house,&#34; said George&#39;s&#10;mother. &#34;It is not easy to find a master who has room for him at&#10;night, and we shall have to provide him with clothes too. The&#10;little bit of eating that he wants can be managed for him, for he&#39;s&#10;quite happy with a few boiled potatoes; and he gets taught for&#10;nothing. Let the boy go his own way. You will say that he will be&#10;our joy some day, and the Professor says so too.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The confirmation suit was ready. The mother had worked it&#10;herself; but the tailor who did repairs had cut them out, and a&#10;capital cutter-out he was.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;If he had had a better position, and been able to keep a&#10;workshop and journeymen,&#34; the porter&#39;s wife said, &#34;he might have&#10;been a court tailor.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The clothes were ready, and the candidate for confirmation&#10;was ready. On his confirmation day, George received a great&#10;pinchbeck watch from his godfather, the old iron monger&#39;s shopman,&#10;the richest of his godfathers. The watch was an old and tried&#10;servant. It always went too fast, but that is better than to be&#10;lagging behind. That was a costly present. And from the General&#39;s&#10;apartment there arrived a hymn-book bound in morocco, sent by the&#10;little lady to whom George had given pictures. At the beginning of&#10;the book his name was written, and her name, as &#34;his gracious&#10;patroness.&#34; These words had been written at the dictation of the&#10;General&#39;s lady, and the General had read the inscription, and&#10;pronounced it &#34;Charming!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That is really a great attention from a family of such&#10;position,&#34; said the porter&#39;s wife; and George was sent up stairs to&#10;show himself in his confirmation clothes, with the hymn-book in his&#10;hand.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The General&#39;s lady was sitting very much wrapped up, and&#10;had the bad headache she always had when time hung heavy upon her&#10;hands. She looked at George very pleasantly, and wished him all&#10;prosperity, and that he might never have her headache. The General&#10;was walking about in his dressing-gown. He had a cap with a long&#10;tassel on his head, and Russian boots with red tops on his feet. He&#10;walked three times up and down the room, absorbed in his own&#10;thoughts and recollections, and then stopped and said:&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;So little George is a confirmed Christian now. Be a good&#10;man, and honor those in authority over you. Some day, when you are&#10;an old man, you can say that the General gave you this&#10;precept.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;That was a longer speech than the General was accustomed&#10;to make, and then he went back to his ruminations, and looked very&#10;aristocratic. But of all that George heard and saw up there, little&#10;Miss Emily remained most clear in his thoughts. How graceful she&#10;was, how gentle, and fluttering, and pretty she looked. If she were&#10;to be drawn, it ought to be on a soap-bubble. About her dress,&#10;about her yellow curled hair, there was a fragrance as of a&#10;fresh-blown rose; and to think that he had once divided his bread&#10;and butter with her, and that she had eaten it with enormous&#10;appetite, and nodded to him at every second mouthful! Did she&#10;remember anything about it? Yes, certainly, for she had given him&#10;the beautiful hymn-book in remembrance of this; and when the first&#10;new moon in the first new year after this event came round, he took&#10;a piece of bread, a penny, and his hymn-book, and went out into the&#10;open air, and opened the book to see what psalm he should turn up.&#10;It was a psalm of praise and thanksgiving. Then he opened the book&#10;again to see what would turn up for little Emily. He took great&#10;pains not to open the book in the place where the funeral hymns&#10;were, and yet he got one that referred to the grave and death. But&#10;then he thought this was not a thing in which one must believe; for&#10;all that he was startled when soon afterwards the pretty little&#10;girl had to lie in bed, and the doctor&#39;s carriage stopped at the&#10;gate every day.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;They will not keep her with them,&#34; said the porter&#39;s&#10;wife. &#34;The good God knows whom He will summon to&#10;Himself.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But they kept her after all; and George drew pictures and&#10;sent them to her. He drew the Czar&#39;s palace; the old Kremlin at&#10;Moscow, just as it stood, with towers and cupolas; and these&#10;cupolas looked like gigantic green and gold cucumbers, at least in&#10;George&#39;s drawing. Little Emily was highly pleased, and&#10;consequently, when a week had elapsed, George sent her a few more&#10;pictures, all with buildings in them; for, you see, she could&#10;imagine all sorts of things inside the windows and&#10;doors.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;He drew a Chinese house, with bells hanging from every one&#10;of sixteen stories. He drew two Grecian temples with slender marble&#10;pillars, and with steps all round them. He drew a Norwegian church.&#10;It was easy to see that this church had been built entirely of&#10;wood, hewn out and wonderfully put together; every story looked as&#10;if it had rockers, like a cradle. But the most beautiful of all was&#10;the castle, drawn on one of the leaves, and which he called&#10;&#34;Emily&#39;s Castle.&#34; This was the kind of place in which she must&#10;live. That is what George had thought, and consequently he had put&#10;into this building whatever he thought most beautiful in all the&#10;others. It had carved wood-work, like the Norwegian church; marble&#10;pillars, like the Grecian temple; bells in every story; and was&#10;crowned with cupolas, green and gilded, like those of the Kremlin&#10;of the Czar. It was a real child&#39;s castle, and under every window&#10;was written what the hall or the room inside was intended to be;&#10;for instance: &#34;Here Emily sleeps;&#34; &#34;Here Emily dances;&#34; &#34;Here Emily&#10;plays at receiving visitors.&#34; It was a real pleasure to look at the&#10;castle, and right well was the castle looked at&#10;accordingly.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Charming!&#34; said the General.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But the old Count&#8212;for there was an old Count there, who&#10;was still grander than the General, and had a castle of his&#10;own&#8212;said nothing at all; he heard that it had been designed and&#10;drawn by the porter&#39;s little son. Not that he was so very little,&#10;either, for he had already been confirmed. The old Count looked at&#10;the pictures, and had his own thoughts as he did so.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;One day, when it was very gloomy, gray, wet weather, the&#10;brightest of days dawned for George; for the Professor at the&#10;Academy called him into his room.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Listen to me, my friend,&#34; said the Professor; &#34;I want to&#10;speak to you. The Lord has been good to you in giving you&#10;abilities, and He has also been good in placing you among kind&#10;people. The old Count at the corner yonder has been speaking to me&#10;about you. I have also seen your sketches; but we will not say any&#10;more about those, for there is a good deal to correct in them. But&#10;from this time forward you may come twice a-week to my&#10;drawing-class, and then you will soon learn how to do them better.&#10;I think there&#39;s more of the architect than of the painter in you.&#10;You will have time to think that over; but go across to the old&#10;Count this very day, and thank God for having sent you such a&#10;friend.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was a great house&#8212;the house of the old Count at the&#10;corner. Round the windows elephants and dromedaries were carved,&#10;all from the old times; but the old Count loved the new time best,&#10;and what it brought, whether it came from the first floor, or from&#10;the cellar, or from the attic.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I think,&#34; said, the porter&#39;s wife, &#34;the grander people&#10;are, the fewer airs do they give themselves. How kind and&#10;straightforward the old count is! and he talks exactly like you and&#10;me. Now, the General and his lady can&#39;t do that. And George was&#10;fairly wild with delight yesterday at the good reception he met&#10;with at the Count&#39;s, and so am I to-day, after speaking to the&#10;great man. Wasn&#39;t it a good thing that we didn&#39;t bind George&#10;apprentice to a handicraftsman? for he has abilities of his&#10;own.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But they must be helped on by others,&#34; said the&#10;father.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That help he has got now,&#34; rejoined the mother; &#34;for the&#10;Count spoke out quite clearly and distinctly.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But I fancy it began with the General,&#34; said the father,&#10;&#34;and we must thank them too.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Let us do so with all my heart,&#34; cried the mother,&#10;&#34;though I fancy we have not much to thank them for. I will thank&#10;the good God; and I will thank Him, too, for letting little Emily&#10;get well.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Emily was getting on bravely, and George got on bravely&#10;too. In the course of the year he won the little silver prize medal&#10;of the Academy, and afterwards he gained the great one&#10;too.&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It would have been better, after all, if he had been&#10;apprenticed to a handicraftsman,&#34; said the porter&#39;s wife, weeping;&#10;&#34;for then we could have kept him with us. What is he to do in Rome?&#10;I shall never get a sight of him again, not even if he comes back;&#10;but that he won&#39;t do, the dear boy.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It is fortune and fame for him,&#34; said the&#10;father.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, thank you, my friend,&#34; said the mother; &#34;you are&#10;saying what you do not mean. You are just as sorrowful as I&#10;am.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And it was all true about the sorrow and the journey. But&#10;everybody said it was a great piece of good fortune for the young&#10;fellow. And he had to take leave, and of the General too. The&#10;General&#39;s lady did not show herself, for she had her bad headache.&#10;On this occasion the General told his only anecdote, about what he&#10;had said to the Prince, and how the Prince had said to him, &#34;You&#10;are incomparable.&#34; And he held out a languid hand to&#10;George.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Emily gave George her hand too, and looked almost sorry;&#10;and George was the most sorry of all.&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Time goes by when one has something to do; and it goes by,&#10;too, when one has nothing to do. The time is equally long, but not&#10;equally useful. It was useful to George, and did not seem long at&#10;all, except when he happened to be thinking of his home. How might&#10;the good folks be getting on, up stairs and down stairs? Yes, there&#10;was writing about that, and many things can be put into a&#10;letter&#8212;bright sunshine and dark, heavy days. Both of these were in&#10;the letter which brought the news that his father was dead, and&#10;that his mother was alone now. She wrote that Emily had come down&#10;to see her, and had been to her like an angel of comfort; and&#10;concerning herself, she added that she had been allowed to keep her&#10;situation as porteress.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The General&#39;s lady kept a diary, and in this diary was&#10;recorded every ball she attended and every visit she received. The&#10;diary was illustrated by the insertion of the visiting cards of the&#10;diplomatic circle and of the most noble families; and the General&#39;s&#10;lady was proud of it. The diary kept growing through a long time,&#10;and amid many severe headaches, and through a long course of&#10;half-nights, that is to say, of court balls. Emily had now been to&#10;a court ball for the first time. Her mother had worn a bright red&#10;dress, with black lace, in the Spanish style; the daughter had been&#10;attired in white, fair and delicate; green silk ribbons fluttered&#10;like flag-leaves among her yellow locks, and on her head she wore a&#10;wreath of water-lillies. Her eyes were so blue and clear, her mouth&#10;was so delicate and red, she looked like a little water spirit, as&#10;beautiful as such a spirit can be imagined. The Princes danced with&#10;her, one after another of course; and the General&#39;s lady had not a&#10;headache for a week afterwards.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But the first ball was not the last, and Emily could not&#10;stand it; it was a good thing, therefore, that summer brought with&#10;it rest, and exercise in the open air. The family had been invited&#10;by the old Count to visit him at him castle. That was a castle with&#10;a garden which was worth seeing. Part of this garden was laid out&#10;quite in the style of the old days, with stiff green hedges; you&#10;walked as if between green walls with peep-holes in them. Box trees&#10;and yew trees stood there trimmed into the form of stars and&#10;pyramids, and water sprang from fountains in large grottoes lined&#10;with shells. All around stood figures of the most beautiful&#10;stone&#8212;that could be seen in their clothes as well as in their&#10;faces; every flower-bed had a different shape, and represented a&#10;fish, or a coat of arms, or a monogram. That was the French part of&#10;the garden; and from this part the visitor came into what appeared&#10;like the green, fresh forest, where the trees might grow as they&#10;chose, and accordingly they were great and glorious. The grass was&#10;green, and beautiful to walk on, and it was regularly cut, and&#10;rolled, and swept, and tended. That was the English part of the&#10;garden.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Old time and new time,&#34; said the Count, &#34;here they run&#10;well into one another. In two years the building itself will put on&#10;a proper appearance, there will be a complete metamorphosis in&#10;beauty and improvement. I shall show you the drawings, and I shall&#10;show you the architect, for he is to dine here to-day.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Charming!&#34; said the General.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;Tis like Paradise here,&#34; said the General&#39;s lady, &#34;and&#10;yonder you have a knight&#39;s castle!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That&#39;s my poultry-house,&#34; observed the Count. &#34;The&#10;pigeons live in the tower, the turkeys in the first floor, but old&#10;Elsie rules in the ground floor. She has apartments on all sides of&#10;her. The sitting hens have their own room, and the hens with&#10;chickens have theirs; and the ducks have their own particular door&#10;leading to the water.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Charming!&#34; repeated the General.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And all sailed forth to see these wonderful things. Old&#10;Elsie stood in the room on the ground floor, and by her side stood&#10;Architect George. He and Emily now met for the first time after&#10;several years, and they met in the poultry-house.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Yes, there he stood, and was handsome enough to be looked&#10;at. His face was frank and energetic; he had black shining hair,&#10;and a smile about his mouth, which said, &#34;I have a brownie that&#10;sits in my ear, and knows every one of you, inside and out.&#34; Old&#10;Elsie had pulled off her wooden shoes, and stood there in her&#10;stockings, to do honor to the noble guests. The hens clucked, and&#10;the cocks crowed, and the ducks waddled to and fro, and said,&#10;&#34;Quack, quack!&#34; But the fair, pale girl, the friend of his&#10;childhood, the daughter of the General, stood there with a rosy&#10;blush on her usually pale cheeks, and her eyes opened wide, and her&#10;mouth seemed to speak without uttering a word, and the greeting he&#10;received from her was the most beautiful greeting a young man can&#10;desire from a young lady, if they are not related, or have not&#10;danced many times together, and she and the architect had never&#10;danced together.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Count shook hands with him, and introduced&#10;him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;He is not altogether a stranger, our young friend&#10;George.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The General&#39;s lady bowed to him, and the General&#39;s&#10;daughter was very nearly giving him her hand; but she did not give&#10;it to him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Our little Master George!&#34; said the General. &#34;Old&#10;friends! Charming!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You have become quite an Italian,&#34; said the General&#39;s&#10;lady, &#34;and I presume you speak the language like a&#10;native?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;My wife sings the language, but she does not speak it,&#34;&#10;observed the General.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;At dinner, George sat at the right hand of Emily, whom the&#10;General had taken down, while the Count led in the General&#39;s&#10;lady.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Mr. George talked and told of his travels; and he could&#10;talk well, and was the life and soul of the table, though the old&#10;Count could have been it too. Emily sat silent, but she listened,&#10;and her eyes gleamed, but she said nothing.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the verandah, among the flowers, she and George stood&#10;together; the rose-bushes concealed them. And George was speaking&#10;again, for he took the lead now.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Many thanks for the kind consideration you showed my old&#10;mother,&#34; he said. &#34;I know that you went down to her on the night&#10;when my father died, and you stayed with her till his eyes were&#10;closed. My heartiest thanks!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;He took Emily&#39;s hand and kissed it&#8212;he might do so on such&#10;an occasion. She blushed deeply, but pressed his hand, and looked&#10;at him with her dear blue eyes.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Your mother was a dear soul!&#34; she said. &#34;How fond she was&#10;of her son! And she let me read all your letters, so that I almost&#10;believe I know you. How kind you were to me when I was little girl!&#10;You used to give me pictures.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Which you tore in two,&#34; said George.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No, I have still your drawing of the castle.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I must build the castle in reality now,&#34; said George; and&#10;he became quite warm at his own words.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The General and the General&#39;s lady talked to each other in&#10;their room about the porter&#39;s son&#8212;how he knew how to behave, and to&#10;express himself with the greatest propriety.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;He might be a tutor,&#34; said the General.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Intellect!&#34; said the General&#39;s lady; but she did not say&#10;anything more.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;During the beautiful summer-time Mr. George several times&#10;visited the Count at his castle; and he was missed when he did not&#10;come.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;How much the good God has given you that he has not given&#10;to us poor mortals,&#34; said Emily to him. &#34;Are you sure you are very&#10;grateful for it?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It flattered George that the lovely young girl should look&#10;up to him, and he thought then that Emily had unusually good&#10;abilities. And the General felt more and more convinced that George&#10;was no cellar-child.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;His mother was a very good woman,&#34; he observed. &#34;It is&#10;only right I should do her that justice now she is in her&#10;grave.&#34;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The summer passed away, and the winter came; again there&#10;was talk about Mr. George. He was highly respected, and was&#10;received in the first circles. The General had met him at a court&#10;ball.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And now there was a ball to be given in the General&#39;s&#10;house for Emily, and could Mr. George be invited to it?&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;He whom the King invites can be invited by the General&#10;also,&#34; said the General, and drew himself up till he stood quite an&#10;inch higher than before.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Mr. George was invited, and he came; princes and counts&#10;came, and they danced, one better than the other. But Emily could&#10;only dance one dance&#8212;the first; for she made a false step&#8212;nothing&#10;of consequence; but her foot hurt her, so that she had to be&#10;careful, and leave off dancing, and look at the others. So she sat&#10;and looked on, and the architect stood by her side.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I suppose you are giving her the whole history of St.&#10;Peter&#39;s,&#34; said the General, as he passed by; and smiled, like the&#10;personification of patronage.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;With the same patronizing smile he received Mr. George a&#10;few days afterwards. The young man came, no doubt, to return thanks&#10;for the invitation to the ball. What else could it be? But indeed&#10;there was something else, something very astonishing and startling.&#10;He spoke words of sheer lunacy, so that the General could hardly&#10;believe his own ears. It was &#34;the height of rhodomontade,&#34; an&#10;offer, quite an inconceivable offer&#8212;Mr. George came to ask the hand&#10;of Emily in marriage!&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Man!&#34; cried the General, and his brain seemed to be&#10;boiling. &#34;I don&#39;t understand you at all. What is it you say? What&#10;is it you want? I don&#39;t know you. Sir! Man! What possesses you to&#10;break into my house? And am I to stand here and listen to you?&#34; He&#10;stepped backwards into his bed-room, locked the door behind him,&#10;and left Mr. George standing alone. George stood still for a few&#10;minutes, and then turned round and left the room. Emily was&#10;standing in the corridor.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;My father has answered?&#34; she said, and her voice&#10;trembled.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;George pressed her hand.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;He has escaped me,&#34; he replied; &#34;but a better time will&#10;come.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;There were tears in Emily&#39;s eyes, but in the young man&#39;s&#10;eyes shone courage and confidence; and the sun shone through the&#10;window, and cast his beams on the pair, and gave them his&#10;blessing.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The General sat in his room, bursting hot. Yes, he was&#10;still boiling, until he boiled over in the exclamation, &#34;Lunacy!&#10;porter! madness!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Not an hour was over before the General&#39;s lady knew it out&#10;of the General&#39;s own mouth. She called Emily, and remained alone&#10;with her.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You poor child,&#34; she said; &#34;to insult you so! to insult&#10;us so! There are tears in your eyes, too, but they become you well.&#10;You look beautiful in tears. You look as I looked on my&#10;wedding-day. Weep on, my sweet Emily.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, that I must,&#34; said Emily, &#34;if you and my father do&#10;not say &#39;yes.&#39;&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Child!&#34; screamed the General&#39;s lady; &#34;you are ill! You&#10;are talking wildly, and I shall have a most terrible headache! Oh,&#10;what a misfortune is coming upon our house! Don&#39;t make your mother&#10;die, Emily, or you will have no mother.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the eyes of the General&#39;s lady were wet, for she could&#10;not bear to think of her own death.&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the newspapers there was an announcement. &#34;Mr. George&#10;has been elected Professor of the Fifth Class, number&#10;Eight.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It&#39;s a pity that his parents are dead and cannot read&#10;it,&#34; said the new porter people, who now lived in the cellar under&#10;the General&#39;s apartments. They knew that the Professor had been&#10;born and grown up within their four walls.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Now he&#39;ll get a salary,&#34; said the man.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, that&#39;s not much for a poor child,&#34; said the&#10;woman.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Eighteen dollars a year,&#34; said the man. &#34;Why, it&#39;s a good&#10;deal of money.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No, I mean the honor of it,&#34; replied the wife. &#34;Do you&#10;think he cares for the money? Those few dollars he can earn a&#10;hundred times over, and most likely he&#39;ll get a rich wife into the&#10;bargain. If we had children of our own, husband, our child should&#10;be an architect and a professor too.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;George was spoken well of in the cellar, and he was spoken&#10;well of in the first floor. The old Count took upon himself to do&#10;that.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The pictures he had drawn in his childhood gave occasion&#10;for it. But how did the conversation come to turn on these&#10;pictures? Why, they had been talking of Russia and of Moscow, and&#10;thus mention was made of the Kremlin, which little George had once&#10;drawn for Miss Emily. He had drawn many pictures, but the Count&#10;especially remembered one, &#34;Emily&#39;s Castle,&#34; where she was to&#10;sleep, and to dance, and to play at receiving guests.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The Professor was a true man,&#34; said the Count, &#34;and would&#10;be a privy councillor before he died, it was not at all unlikely;&#10;and he might build a real castle for the young lady before that&#10;time came: why not?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That was a strange jest,&#34; remarked the General&#39;s lady,&#10;when the Count had gone away. The General shook his head&#10;thoughtfully, and went out for a ride, with his groom behind him at&#10;a proper distance, and he sat more stiffly than ever on his high&#10;horse.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was Emily&#39;s birthday. Flowers, books, letters, and&#10;visiting cards came pouring in. The General&#39;s lady kissed her on&#10;the mouth, and the General kissed her on the forehead; they were&#10;affectionate parents, and they and Emily had to receive grand&#10;visitors, two of the Princes. They talked of balls and theatres, of&#10;diplomatic missions, of the government of empires and nations; and&#10;then they spoke of talent, native talent; and so the discourse&#10;turned upon the young architect.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;He is building up an immortality for himself,&#34; said one,&#10;&#34;and he will certainly build his way into one of our first&#10;families&#34;.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;One of our first families!&#34; repeated the General and&#10;afterwards the General&#39;s lady; &#34;what is meant by one of our first&#10;families?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I know for whom it was intended,&#34; said the General&#39;s&#10;lady, &#34;but I shall not say it. I don&#39;t think it. Heaven disposes,&#10;but I shall be astonished.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I am astonished also!&#34; said the General. &#34;I haven&#39;t an&#10;idea in my head!&#34; And he fell into a reverie, waiting for&#10;ideas.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;There is a power, a nameless power, in the possession of&#10;favor from above, the favor of Providence, and this favor little&#10;George had. But we are forgetting the birthday.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Emily&#39;s room was fragrant with flowers, sent by male and&#10;female friends; on the table lay beautiful presents for greeting&#10;and remembrance, but none could come from George&#8212;none could come&#10;from him; but it was not necessary, for the whole house was full of&#10;remembrances of him. Even out of the ash-bin the blossom of memory&#10;peeped forth, for Emily had sat whimpering there on the day when&#10;the window-curtain caught fire, and George arrived in the character&#10;of fire engine. A glance out of the window, and the acacia tree&#10;reminded of the days of childhood. Flowers and leaves had fallen,&#10;but there stood the tree covered with hoar frost, looking like a&#10;single huge branch of coral, and the moon shone clear and large&#10;among the twigs, unchanged in its changings, as it was when George&#10;divided his bread and butter with little Emily.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Out of a box the girl took the drawings of the Czar&#39;s&#10;palace and of her own castle&#8212;remembrances of George. The drawings&#10;were looked at, and many thoughts came. She remembered the day&#10;when, unobserved by her father and mother, she had gone down to the&#10;porter&#39;s wife who lay dying. Once again she seemed to sit beside&#10;her, holding the dying woman&#39;s hand in hers, hearing the dying&#10;woman&#39;s last words: &#34;Blessing George!&#34; The mother was thinking of&#10;her son, and now Emily gave her own interpretation to those words.&#10;Yes, George was certainly with her on her birthday.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It happened that the next day was another birthday in that&#10;house, the General&#39;s birthday. He had been born the day after his&#10;daughter, but before her of course&#8212;many years before her. Many&#10;presents arrived, and among them came a saddle of exquisite&#10;workmanship, a comfortable and costly saddle&#8212;one of the Princes had&#10;just such another. Now, from whom might this saddle come? The&#10;General was delighted. There was a little note with the saddle. Now&#10;if the words on the note had been &#34;many thanks for yesterday&#39;s&#10;reception,&#34; we might easily have guessed from whom it came. But the&#10;words were &#34;From somebody whom the General does not&#10;know.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Whom in the world do I not know?&#34; exclaimed the General.&#10;&#34;I know everybody;&#34; and his thoughts wandered all through society,&#10;for he knew everybody there. &#34;That saddle comes from my wife!&#34; he&#10;said at last. &#34;She is teasing me&#8212;charming!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But she was not teasing him; those times were&#10;past.&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Again there was a feast, but it was not in the General&#39;s&#10;house, it was a fancy ball at the Prince&#39;s, and masks were allowed&#10;too.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The General went as Rubens, in a Spanish costume, with a&#10;little ruff round his neck, a sword by his side, and a stately&#10;manner. The General&#39;s lady was Madame Rubens, in black velvet made&#10;high round the neck, exceedingly warm, and with a mill-stone round&#10;her neck in the shape of a great ruff&#8212;accurately dressed after a&#10;Dutch picture in the possession of the General, in which the hands&#10;were especially admired. They were just like the hands of the&#10;General&#39;s lady.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Emily was Psyche. In white crape and lace she was like a&#10;floating swan. She did not want wings at all. She only wore them as&#10;emblematic of Psyche.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Brightness, splendor, light and flowers, wealth and taste&#10;appeared at the ball; there was so much to see, that the beautiful&#10;hands of Madame Rubens made no sensation at all.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A black domino, with an acacia blossom in his cap, danced&#10;with Psyche.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Who is that?&#34; asked the General&#39;s lady.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;His Royal Highness,&#34; replied the General. &#34;I am quite&#10;sure of it. I knew him directly by the pressure of his&#10;hand.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The General&#39;s lady doubted it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;General Rubens had no doubts about it. He went up to the&#10;black domino and wrote the royal letters in the mask&#39;s hand. These&#10;were denied, but the mask gave him a hint.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The words that came with the saddle: &#34;One whom you do not&#10;know, General.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But I do know you,&#34; said the General. &#34;It was you who&#10;sent me the saddle.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The domino raised his hand, and disappeared among the&#10;other guests.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Who is that black domino with whom you were dancing,&#10;Emily?&#34; asked the General&#39;s lady.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I did not ask his name,&#34; she replied, &#34;because you knew&#10;it. It is the Professor. Your protege is here, Count!&#34; she&#10;continued, turning to that nobleman, who stood close by. &#34;A black&#10;domino with acacia blossoms in his cap.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Very likely, my dear lady,&#34; replied the Count. &#34;But one&#10;of the Princes wears just the same costume.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I knew the pressure of the hand,&#34; said the General. &#34;The&#10;saddle came from the Prince. I am so certain of it that I could&#10;invite that domino to dinner.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Do so. If it be the Prince he will certainly come,&#34;&#10;replied the Count.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And if it is the other he will not come,&#34; said the&#10;General, and approached the black domino, who was just speaking&#10;with the King. The General gave a very respectful invitation &#34;that&#10;they might make each other&#39;s acquaintance,&#34; and he smiled in his&#10;certainty concerning the person he was inviting. He spoke loud and&#10;distinctly.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The domino raised his mask, and it was George. &#34;Do you&#10;repeat your invitation, General?&#34; he asked.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The General certainly seemed to grow an inch taller,&#10;assumed a more stately demeanor, and took two steps backward and&#10;one step forward, as if he were dancing a minuet, and then came as&#10;much gravity and expression into the face of the General as the&#10;General could contrive to infuse into it; but he&#10;replied,&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I never retract my words! You are invited, Professor!&#34;&#10;and he bowed with a glance at the King, who must have heard the&#10;whole dialogue.&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Now, there was a company to dinner at the General&#39;s, but&#10;only the old Count and his protege were invited.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I have my foot under his table,&#34; thought George. &#34;That&#39;s&#10;laying the foundation stone.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the foundation stone was really laid, with great&#10;ceremony, at the house of the General and of the General&#39;s&#10;lady.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The man had come, and had spoken quite like a person in&#10;good society, and had made himself very agreeable, so that the&#10;General had often to repeat his &#34;Charming!&#34; The General talked of&#10;this dinner, talked of it even to a court lady; and this lady, one&#10;of the most intellectual persons about the court, asked to be&#10;invited to meet the Professor the next time he should come. So he&#10;had to be invited again; and he was invited, and came, and was&#10;charming again; he could even play chess.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;He&#39;s not out of the cellar,&#34; said the General; &#34;he&#39;s&#10;quite a distinguished person. There are many distinguished persons&#10;of that kind, and it&#39;s no fault of his.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Professor, who was received in the King&#39;s palace,&#10;might very well be received by the General; but that he could ever&#10;belong to the house was out of the question, only the whole town&#10;was talking of it.&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;He grew and grew. The dew of favor fell from above, so no&#10;one was surprised after all that he should become a Privy&#10;Councillor, and Emily a Privy Councillor&#39;s lady.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Life is either a tragedy or a comedy,&#34; said the General.&#10;&#34;In tragedies they die, in comedies they marry one&#10;another.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In this case they married. And they had three clever&#10;boys&#8212;but not all at once.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The sweet children rode on their hobby-horses through all&#10;the rooms when they came to see the grandparents. And the General&#10;also rode on his stick; he rode behind them in the character of&#10;groom to the little Privy Councillors.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the General&#39;s lady sat on her sofa and smiled at them,&#10;even when she had her severest headache.&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;So far did George get, and much further; else it had not&#10;been worth while to tell the story of THE PORTER&#39;S SON.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;Poultry Meg&#39;s Family'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;POULTRY MEG was the only person who lived in the new&#10;stately dwelling that had been built for the fowls and ducks&#10;belonging to the manor house. It stood there where once the old&#10;knightly building had stood with its tower, its pointed gables, its&#10;moat, and its drawbridge. Close by it was a wilderness of trees and&#10;thicket; here the garden had been, and had stretched out to a great&#10;lake, which was now moorland. Crows and choughs flew screaming over&#10;the old trees, and there were crowds of birds; they did not seem to&#10;get fewer when any one shot among them, but seemed rather to&#10;increase. One heard the screaming into the poultry-house, where&#10;Poultry Meg sat with the ducklings running to and fro over her&#10;wooden shoes. She knew every fowl and every duck from the moment it&#10;crept out of the shell; and she was fond of her fowls and her&#10;ducks, and proud of the stately house that had been built for them.&#10;Her own little room in the house was clean and neat, for that was&#10;the wish of the gracious lady to whom the house belonged. She often&#10;came in the company of grand noble guests, to whom she showed &#34;the&#10;hens&#39; and ducks&#39; barracks,&#34; as she called the little&#10;house.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Here were a clothes cupboard, and an, arm-chair, and even&#10;a chest of drawers; and on these drawers a polished metal plate had&#10;been placed, whereon was engraved the word &#34;Grubbe,&#34; and this was&#10;the name of the noble family that had lived in the house of old.&#10;The brass plate had been found when they were digging the&#10;foundation; and the clerk has said it had no value except in being&#10;an old relic. The clerk knew all about the place, and about the old&#10;times, for he had his knowledge from books, and many a memorandum&#10;had been written and put in his table-drawer. But the oldest of the&#10;crows perhaps knew more than he, and screamed it out in her own&#10;language; but that was the crow&#39;s language, and the clerk did not&#10;understand that, clever as he was.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;After the hot summer days the mist sometimes hung over the&#10;moorland as if a whole lake were behind the old trees, among which&#10;the crows and the daws were fluttering; and thus it had looked when&#10;the good Knight Grubbe had lived here&#8212;when the old manor house&#10;stood with its thick red walls. The dog-chain used to reach in&#10;those days quite over the gateway; through the tower one went into&#10;a paved passage which led to the rooms; the windows were narrow,&#10;and the panes were small, even in the great hall where the dancing&#10;used to be; but in the time of the last Grubbe, there had been no&#10;dancing in the hall within the memory of man, although an old drum&#10;still lay there that had served as part of the music. Here stood a&#10;quaintly carved cupboard, in which rare flower-roots were kept, for&#10;my Lady Grubbe was fond of plants and cultivated trees and shrubs.&#10;Her husband preferred riding out to shoot wolves and boars; and his&#10;little daughter Marie always went with him part of the way. When&#10;she was only five years old, she would sit proudly on her horse,&#10;and look saucily round with her great black eyes. It was a great&#10;amusement to her to hit out among the hunting-dogs with her whip;&#10;but her father would rather have seen her hit among the peasant&#10;boys, who came running up to stare at their lord.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The peasant in the clay hut close by the knightly house&#10;had a son named Soren, of the same age as the gracious little lady.&#10;The boy could climb well, and had always to bring her down the&#10;bird&#39;s nests. The birds screamed as loud as they could, and one of&#10;the greatest of them hacked him with its beak over the eye so that&#10;the blood ran down, and it was at first thought the eye had been&#10;destroyed; but it had not been injured after all. Marie Grubbe used&#10;to call him her Soren, and that was a great favor, and was an&#10;advantage to Soren&#39;s father&#8212;poor Jon, who had one day committed a&#10;fault, and was to be punished by riding on the wooden horse. This&#10;same horse stood in the courtyard, and had four poles for legs, and&#10;a single narrow plant for a back; on this Jon had to ride astride,&#10;and some heavy bricks were fastened to his feet into the bargain,&#10;that he might not sit too comfortably. He made horrible grimaces,&#10;and Soren wept and implored little Marie to interfere. She&#10;immediately ordered that Soren&#39;s father should be taken down, and&#10;when they did not obey her, she stamped on the floor, and pulled at&#10;her father&#39;s sleeve till it was torn to pieces. She would have her&#10;way, and she got her way, and Soren&#39;s father was taken&#10;down.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Lady Grubbe, who now came up, parted her little daughter&#39;s&#10;hair from the child&#39;s brow, and looked at her affectionately; but&#10;Marie did not understand why.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;She wanted to go to the hounds, and not to her mother, who&#10;went down into the garden, to the lake where the water-lily&#10;bloomed, and the heads of bulrushes nodded amid the reeds; and she&#10;looked at all this beauty and freshness. &#34;How pleasant!&#34; she said.&#10;In the garden stood at that time a rare tree, which she herself had&#10;planted. It was called the blood-beech&#8212;a kind of negro growing&#10;among the other trees, so dark brown were the leaves. This tree&#10;required much sunshine, for in continual shade it would become&#10;bright green like the other trees, and thus lose its distinctive&#10;character. In the lofty chestnut trees were many birds&#39; nests, and&#10;also in the thickets and in the grassy meadows. It seemed as though&#10;the birds knew that they were protected here, and that no one must&#10;fire a gun at them.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Little Marie came here with Soren. He knew how to climb,&#10;as we have already said, and eggs and fluffy-feathered young birds&#10;were brought down. The birds, great and small, flew about in terror&#10;and tribulation; the peewit from the fields, and the crows and daws&#10;from the high trees, screamed and screamed; it was just such din as&#10;the family will raise to the present day.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What are you doing, you children?&#34; cried the gentle lady;&#10;&#34;that is sinful!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Soren stood abashed, and even the little gracious lady&#10;looked down a little; but then he said, quite short and&#10;pretty,&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;My father lets me do it!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Craw-craw! away-away from here!&#34; cried the great black&#10;birds, and they flew away; but on the following day they came back,&#10;for they were at home here.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The quiet gentle lady did not remain long at home here on&#10;earth, for the good God called her away; and, indeed, her home was&#10;rather with Him than in the knightly house; and the church bells&#10;tolled solemnly when her corpse was carried to the church, and the&#10;eyes of the poor people were wet with tears, for she had been good&#10;to them.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;When she was gone, no one attended to her plantations, and&#10;the garden ran to waste. Grubbe the knight was a hard man, they&#10;said; but his daughter, young as she was, knew how to manage him.&#10;He used to laugh and let her have her way. She was now twelve years&#10;old, and strongly built. She looked the people through and through&#10;with her black eyes, rode her horse as bravely as a man, and could&#10;fire off her gun like a practiced hunter.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;One day there were great visitors in the neighborhood, the&#10;grandest visitors who could come. The young King, and his&#10;half-brother and comrade, the Lord Ulric Frederick Gyldenlowe. They&#10;wanted to hunt the wild boar, and to pass a few days at the castle&#10;of Grubbe.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Gyldenlowe sat at table next to Marie Grubbe, and he took&#10;her by the hand and gave her a kiss, as if she had been a relation;&#10;but she gave him a box on the ear, and told him she could not bear&#10;him, at which there was great laughter, as if that had been a very&#10;amusing thing.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And perhaps it was very amusing, for, five years&#10;afterwards, when Marie had fulfilled her seventeenth year, a&#10;messenger arrived with a letter, in which Lord Gyldenlowe proposed&#10;for the hand of the noble young lady. There was a thing for&#10;you!&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;He is the grandest and most gallant gentleman in the&#10;whole country,&#34; said Grubbe the knight; &#34;that is not a thing to&#10;despise.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I don&#39;t care so very much about him,&#34; said Marie Grubbe;&#10;but she did not despise the grandest man of all the country, who&#10;sat by the king&#39;s side.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Silver plate, and fine linen and woollen, went off to&#10;Copenhagen in a ship, while the bride made the journey by land in&#10;ten days. But the outfit met with contrary winds, or with no winds&#10;at all, for four months passed before it arrived; and when it came,&#10;my Lady Gyldenlowe was gone.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I&#39;d rather lie on coarse sacking than lie in his silken&#10;beds,&#34; she declared. &#34;I&#39;d rather walk barefoot than drive with him&#10;in a coach!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Late one evening in November two women came riding into&#10;the town of Aarhuus. They were the gracious Lady Gyldenlowe (Marie&#10;Grubbe) and her maid. They came from the town of Weile, whither&#10;they had come in a ship from Copenhagen. They stopped at Lord&#10;Grubbe&#39;s stone mansion in Aarhuus. Grubbe was not well pleased with&#10;this visit. Marie was accosted in hard words; but she had a bedroom&#10;given her, and got her beer soup of a morning; but the evil part of&#10;her father&#39;s nature was aroused against her, and she was not used&#10;to that. She was not of a gentle temper, and we often answer as we&#10;are addressed. She answered openly, and spoke with bitterness and&#10;hatred of her husband, with whom she declared she would not live;&#10;she was too honorable for that.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A year went by, but it did not go by pleasantly. There&#10;were evil words between the father and the daughter, and that ought&#10;never to be. Bad words bear bad fruit. What could be the end of&#10;such a state of things?&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;We two cannot live under the same roof,&#34; said the father&#10;one day. &#34;Go away from here to our old manor house; but you had&#10;better bite your tongue off than spread any lies among the&#10;people.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And so the two parted. She went with her maid to the old&#10;castle where she had been born, and near which the gentle, pious&#10;lady, her mother, was lying in the church vault. An old cowherd&#10;lived in the courtyard, and was the only other inhabitant of the&#10;place. In the rooms heavy black cobwebs hung down, covered with&#10;dust; in the garden everything grew just as it would; hops and&#10;climbing plants ran like a net between the trees and bushes, and&#10;the hemlock and nettle grew larger and stronger. The blood-beech&#10;had been outgrown by other trees, and now stood in the shade; and&#10;its leaves were green like those of the common trees, and its glory&#10;had departed. Crows and choughs, in great close masses, flew past&#10;over the tall chestnut trees, and chattered and screamed as if they&#10;had something very important to tell one another&#8212;as if they were&#10;saying, &#34;Now she&#39;s come back again, the little girl who had their&#10;eggs and their young ones stolen from them; and as for the thief&#10;who had got them down, he had to climb up a leafless tree, for he&#10;sat on a tall ship&#39;s mast, and was beaten with a rope&#39;s end if he&#10;did not behave himself.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The clerk told all this in our own times; he had collected&#10;it and looked it up in books and memoranda. It was to be found,&#10;with many other writings, locked up in his table-drawer.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Upward and downward is the course of the world,&#34; said he.&#10;&#34;It is strange to hear.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And we will hear how it went with Marie Grubbe. We need&#10;not for that forget Poultry Meg, who is sitting in her capital&#10;hen-house, in our own time. Marie Grubbe sat down in her times, but&#10;not with the same spirit that old Poultry Meg showed.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The winter passed away, and the spring and the summer&#10;passed away, and the autumn came again, with the damp, cold&#10;sea-fog. It was a lonely, desolate life in the old manor house.&#10;Marie Grubbe took her gun in her hand and went out to the heath,&#10;and shot hares and foxes, and whatever birds she could hit. More&#10;than once she met the noble Sir Palle Dyre, of Norrebak, who was&#10;also wandering about with his gun and his dogs. He was tall and&#10;strong, and boasted of this when they talked together. He could&#10;have measured himself against the deceased Mr. Brockenhuus, of&#10;Egeskov, of whom the people still talked. Palle Dyre had, after the&#10;example of Brockenhuus, caused an iron chain with a hunting-horn to&#10;be hung in his gateway; and when he came riding home, he used to&#10;seize the chain, and lift himself and his horse from the ground,&#10;and blow the horn.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Come yourself, and see me do that, Dame Marie,&#34; he said.&#10;&#39;One can breathe fresh and free at Norrebak.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;When she went to his castle is not known, but on the altar&#10;candlestick in the church of Norrebak it was inscribed that they&#10;were the gift of Palle Dyre and Marie Grubbe, of Norrebak&#10;Castle.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A great stout man was Palle Dyre. He drank like a sponge.&#10;He was like a tub that could never get full; he snored like a whole&#10;sty of pigs, and he looked red and bloated.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;He is treacherous and malicious,&#34; said Dame Pally Dyre,&#10;Grubbe&#39;s daughter. Soon she was weary of her life with him, but&#10;that did not make it better.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;One day the table was spread, and the dishes grew cold.&#10;Palle Dyre was out hunting foxes, and the gracious lady was nowhere&#10;to be found. Towards midnight Palle Dyre came home, but Dame Dyre&#10;came neither at midnight, nor next morning. She had turned her back&#10;upon Norrebak, and had ridden away without saying&#10;good-bye.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was gray, wet weather; the wind grew cold, and a flight&#10;of black screaming birds flew over her head. They were not so&#10;homeless as she.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;First she journeyed southward, quite down into the German&#10;land. A couple of golden rings with costly stones were turned into&#10;money; and then she turned to the east, and then she turned again&#10;and went towards the west. She had no food before her eyes, and&#10;murmured against everything, even against the good God himself, so&#10;wretched was her soul. Soon her body became wretched too, and she&#10;was scarcely able to move a foot. The peewit flew up as she&#10;stumbled over the mound of earth where it had built its nest. The&#10;bird cried, as it always cried, &#34;You thief! you thief!&#34; She had&#10;never stolen her neighbor&#39;s goods; but as a little girl she had&#10;caused eggs and young birds to be taken from the trees, and she&#10;thought of that now.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;From where she lay she could see the sand-dunes. By the&#10;seashore lived fishermen; but she could not get so far, she was so&#10;ill. The great white sea-mews flew over her head, and screamed as&#10;the crows and daws screamed at home in the garden of the manor&#10;house. The birds flew quite close to her, and at last it seemed to&#10;her as if they became black as crows, and then all was night before&#10;her eyes.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;When she opened her eyes again, she was being lifted and&#10;carried. A great strong man had taken her up in his arms, and she&#10;was looking straight into his bearded face. He had a scar over one&#10;eye, which seemed to divide the eyebrow into two parts. Weak as she&#10;was, he carried her to the ship, where he got a rating for it from&#10;the captain.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The next day the ship sailed away. Madame Grubbe had not&#10;been put ashore, so she sailed away with it. But she will return,&#10;will she not? Yes, but where, and when?&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The clerk could tell about this too, and it was not a&#10;story which he patched together himself. He had the whole strange&#10;history out of an old authentic book, which we ourselves can take&#10;out and read. The Danish historian, Ludwig Holberg, who has written&#10;so many useful books and merry comedies, from which we can get such&#10;a good idea of his times and their people, tells in his letters of&#10;Marie Grubbe, where and how he met her. It is well worth hearing;&#10;but for all that, we don&#39;t at all forget Poultry Meg, who is&#10;sitting cheerful and comfortable in the charming&#10;fowl-house.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The ship sailed away with Marie Grubbe. That&#39;s where we&#10;left off.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Long years went by.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The plague was raging at Copenhagen; it was in the year&#10;1711. The Queen of Denmark went away to her German home, the King&#10;quitted the capital, and everybody who could do so hurried away.&#10;The students, even those who had board and lodging gratis, left the&#10;city. One of these students, the last who had remained in the free&#10;college, at last went away too. It was two o&#39;clock in the morning.&#10;He was carrying his knapsack, which was better stacked with books&#10;and writings than with clothes. A damp mist hung over the town; not&#10;a person was to be seen in the streets; the street-doors around&#10;were marked with crosses, as a sign that the plague was within, or&#10;that all the inmates were dead. A great wagon rattled past him; the&#10;coachman brandished his whip, and the horses flew by at a gallop.&#10;The wagon was filled with corpses. The young student kept his hand&#10;before his face, and smelt at some strong spirits that he had with&#10;him on a sponge in a little brass scent-case. Out of a small tavern&#10;in one of the streets there were sounds of singing and of&#10;unhallowed laughter, from people who drank the night through to&#10;forget that the plague was at their doors, and that they might be&#10;put into the wagon as the others had been. The student turned his&#10;steps towards the canal at the castle bridge, where a couple of&#10;small ships were lying; one of these was weighing anchor, to get&#10;away from the plague-stricken city.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;If God spares our lives and grants us a fair wind, we are&#10;going to Gronmud, near Falster,&#34; said the captain; and he asked the&#10;name of the student who wished to go with him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ludwig Holberg,&#34; answered the student; and the name&#10;sounded like any other. But now there sounds in it one of the&#10;proudest names of Denmark; then it was the name of a young, unknown&#10;student.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The ship glided past the castle. It was not yet bright day&#10;when it was in the open sea. A light wind filled the sails, and the&#10;young student sat down with his face turned towards the fresh wind,&#10;and went to sleep, which was not exactly the most prudent thing he&#10;could have done.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Already on the third day the ship lay by the island of&#10;Falster.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Do you know any one here with whom I could lodge&#10;cheaply?&#34; Holberg asked the captain.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I should think you would do well to go to the ferry-woman&#10;in Borrehaus,&#34; answered the captain. &#34;If you want to be very civil&#10;to her, her name is Mother Soren Sorensen Muller. But it may happen&#10;that she may fly into a fury if you are too polite to her. The man&#10;is in custody for a crime, and that&#39;s why she manages the&#10;ferry-boat herself&#8212;she has fists of her own.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The student took his knapsack and betook himself to the&#10;ferry-house. The house door was not locked&#8212;it opened, and he went&#10;into a room with a brick floor, where a bench, with a great&#10;coverlet of leather, formed the chief article of furniture. A white&#10;hen, who had a brood of chickens, was fastened to the bench, and&#10;had overturned the pipkin of water, so that the wet ran across the&#10;floor. There were no people either here or in the adjoining room;&#10;only a cradle stood there, in which was a child. The ferry-boat&#10;came back with only one person in it. Whether that person was a man&#10;or a woman was not an easy matter to determine. The person in&#10;question was wrapped in a great cloak, and wore a kind of hood.&#10;Presently the boat lay to.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was a woman who got out of it and came into the room.&#10;She looked very stately when she straightened her back; two proud&#10;eyes looked forth from beneath her black eyebrows. It was Mother&#10;Soren, the ferry-wife. The crows and daws might have called out&#10;another name for her, which we know better.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;She looked morose, and did not seem to care to talk; but&#10;this much was settled, that the student should board in her house&#10;for an indefinite time, while things looked so bad in&#10;Copenhagen.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;This or that honest citizen would often come to the&#10;ferry-house from the neighboring little town. There came Frank the&#10;cutler, and Sivert the exciseman. They drank a mug of beer in the&#10;ferry-house, and used to converse with the student, for he was a&#10;clever young man, who knew his &#34;Practica,&#34; as they called it; he&#10;could read Greek and Latin, and was well up in learned&#10;subjects.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The less one knows, the less it presses upon one,&#34; said&#10;Mother Soren.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You have to work hard,&#34; said Holberg one day, when she&#10;was dipping clothes in the strong soapy water, and was obliged&#10;herself to split the logs for the fire.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That&#39;s my affair,&#34; she replied.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Have you been obliged to toil in this way from your&#10;childhood?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You can read that from my hands,&#34; she replied, and held&#10;out her hands, that were small indeed, but hard and strong, with&#10;bitten nails. &#34;You are learned, and can read.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;At Christmas-time it began to snow heavily. The cold came&#10;on, the wind blue sharp, as if there were vitriol in it to wash the&#10;people&#39;s faces. Mother Soren did not let that disturb her; she&#10;threw her cloak around her, and drew her hood over her head. Early&#10;in the afternoon&#8212;it was already dark in the house&#8212;she laid wood and&#10;turf on the hearth, and then she sat down to darn her stockings,&#10;for there was no one to do it for her. Towards evening she spoke&#10;more words to the student than it was customary with her to use;&#10;she spoke of her husband.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;He killed a sailor of Dragor by mischance, and for that&#10;he has to work for three years in irons. He&#39;s only a common sailor,&#10;and therefore the law must take its course.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The law is there for people of high rank, too,&#34; said&#10;Holberg.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Do you think so?&#34; said Mother Soren; then she looked into&#10;the fire for a while; but after a time she began to speak again.&#10;&#34;Have you heard of Kai Lykke, who caused a church to be pulled&#10;down, and when the clergyman, Master Martin, thundered from the&#10;pulpit about it, he had him put in irons, and sat in judgment upon&#10;him, and condemned him to death? Yes, and the clergyman was obliged&#10;to bow his head to the stroke. And yet Kai Lykke went&#10;scot-free.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;He had a right to do as he did in those times,&#34; said&#10;Holberg; &#34;but now we have left those times behind us.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You may get a fool to believe that,&#34; cried Mother Soren;&#10;and she got up and went into the room where the child lay. She&#10;lifted up the child, and laid it down more comfortably. Then she&#10;arranged the bed-place of the student. He had the green coverlet,&#10;for he felt the cold more than she, though he was born in&#10;Norway.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;On New Year&#39;s morning it was a bright sunshiny day. The&#10;frost had been so strong, and was still so strong, that the fallen&#10;snow had become a hard mass, and one could walk upon it. The bells&#10;of the little town were tolling for church. Student Holberg wrapped&#10;himself up in his woollen cloak, and wanted to go to the&#10;town.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Over the ferry-house the crows and daws were flying with&#10;loud cries; one could hardly hear the church bells for their&#10;screaming. Mother Soren stood in front of the house, filling a&#10;brass pot with snow, which she was going to put on the fire to get&#10;drinking water. She looked up to the crowd of birds, and thought&#10;her own thoughts.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Student Holberg went to church. On his way there and on&#10;his return he passed by the house of tax-collector Sivert, by the&#10;town-gate. Here he was invited to take a mug of brown beer with&#10;treacle and sugar. The discourse fell upon Mother Soren, but the&#10;tax collector did not know much about her, and, indeed, few knew&#10;much about her. She did not belong to the island of Falster, he&#10;said; she had a little property of her own at one time. Her husband&#10;was a common sailor, a fellow of a very hot temper, and had killed&#10;a sailor of Dragor; and he beat his wife, and yet she defended&#10;him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I should not endure such treatment,&#34; said the&#10;tax-collector&#39;s wife. &#34;I am come of more respectable people. My&#10;father was stocking-weaver to the Court.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And consequently you have married a governmental&#10;official,&#34; said Holberg, and made a bow to her and to the&#10;collector.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was on Twelfth Night, the evening of the festival of&#10;the Three Kings, Mother Soren lit up for Holberg a three-king&#10;candle, that is, a tallow candle with three wicks, which she had&#10;herself prepared.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;A light for each man,&#34; said Holberg.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;For each man?&#34; repeated the woman, looking sharply at&#10;him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;For each of the wise men from the East,&#34; said&#10;Holberg.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You mean it that way,&#34; said she, and then she was silent&#10;for a long time. But on this evening he learned more about her than&#10;he had yet known.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You speak very affectionately of your husband,&#34; observed&#10;Holberg, &#34;and yet the people say that he ill-uses you every&#10;day.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That&#39;s no one&#39;s business but mine,&#34; she replied. &#34;The&#10;blows might have done me good when I was a child; now, I suppose, I&#10;get them for my sins. But I know what good he has done me,&#34; and she&#10;rose up. &#34;When I lay sick upon the desolate heath, and no one would&#10;have pity on me, and no one would have anything to do with me,&#10;except the crows and daws, which came to peck me to bits, he&#10;carried me in his arms, and had to bear hard words because of the&#10;burden he brought on board ship. It&#39;s not in my nature to be sick,&#10;and so I got well. Every man has his own way, and Soren has his;&#10;but the horse must not be judged by the halter. Taking one thing&#10;with another, I have lived more agreeably with him than with the&#10;man whom they called the most noble and gallant of the King&#39;s&#10;subjects. I have had the Stadtholder Gyldenlowe, the King&#39;s&#10;half-brother, for my husband; and afterwards I took Palle Dyre. One&#10;is as good as another, each in his own way, and I in mine. That was&#10;a long gossip, but now you know all about me.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And with those words she left the room.&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was Marie Grubbe! so strangely had fate played with&#10;her. She did not live to see many anniversaries of the festival of&#10;the Three Kings; Holberg has recorded that she died in June, 1716;&#10;but he has not written down, for he did not know, that a number of&#10;great black birds circled over the ferry-house, when Mother Soren,&#10;as she was called, was lying there a corpse. They did not scream,&#10;as if they knew that at a burial silence should be observed. So&#10;soon as she lay in the earth, the birds disappeared; but on the&#10;same evening in Jutland, at the old manor house, an enormous number&#10;of crows and choughs were seen; they all cried as loud as they&#10;could, as if they had some announcement to make. Perhaps they&#10;talked of him who, as a little boy, had taken away their eggs and&#10;their young; of the peasant&#39;s son, who had to wear an iron garter,&#10;and of the noble young lady, who ended by being a ferryman&#39;s&#10;wife.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Brave! brave!&#34; they cried.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the whole family cried, &#34;Brave! brave!&#34; when the old&#10;house was pulled down.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;They are still crying, and yet there&#39;s nothing to cry&#10;about,&#34; said the clerk, when he told the story. &#34;The family is&#10;extinct, the house has been pulled down, and where it stood is now&#10;the stately poultry-house, with gilded weathercocks, and the old&#10;Poultry Meg. She rejoices greatly in her beautiful dwelling. If she&#10;had not come here,&#34; the old clerk added, &#34;she would have had to go&#10;into the work-house.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The pigeons cooed over her, the turkey-cocks gobbled, and&#10;the ducks quacked.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Nobody knew her,&#34; they said; &#34;she belongs to no family.&#10;It&#39;s pure charity that she is here at all. She has neither a drake&#10;father nor a hen mother, and has no descendants.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;She came of a great family, for all that; but she did not&#10;know it, and the old clerk did not know it, though he had so much&#10;written down; but one of the old crows knew about it, and told&#10;about it. She had heard from her own mother and grandmother about&#10;Poultry Meg&#39;s mother and grandmother. And we know the grandmother&#10;too. We saw her ride, as child, over the bridge, looking proudly&#10;around her, as if the whole world belonged to her, and all the&#10;birds&#39; nests in it; and we saw her on the heath, by the sand-dunes;&#10;and, last of all, in the ferry-house. The granddaughter, the last&#10;of her race, had come back to the old home, where the old castle&#10;had stood, where the black wild birds were screaming; but she sat&#10;among the tame birds, and these knew her and were fond of her.&#10;Poultry Meg had nothing left to wish for; she looked forward with&#10;pleasure to her death, and she was old enough to die.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Grave, grave!&#34; cried the crows.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And Poultry Meg has a good grave, which nobody knew except&#10;the old crow, if the old crow is not dead already.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And now we know the story of the old manor house, of its&#10;old proprietors, and of all Poultry Meg&#39;s family.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;Children&#39;s Prattle'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;AT a rich merchant&#39;s house there was a children&#39;s party,&#10;and the children of rich and great people were there. The merchant&#10;was a learned man, for his father had sent him to college, and he&#10;had passed his examination. His father had been at first only a&#10;cattle dealer, but always honest and industrious, so that he had&#10;made money, and his son, the merchant, had managed to increase his&#10;store. Clever as he was, he had also a heart; but there was less&#10;said of his heart than of his money. All descriptions of people&#10;visited at the merchant&#39;s house, well born, as well as&#10;intellectual, and some who possessed neither of these&#10;recommendations.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Now it was a children&#39;s party, and there was children&#39;s&#10;prattle, which always is spoken freely from the heart. Among them&#10;was a beautiful little girl, who was terribly proud; but this had&#10;been taught her by the servants, and not by her parents, who were&#10;far too sensible people.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Her father was groom of the Chambers, which is a high&#10;office at court, and she knew it. &#34;I am a child of the court,&#34; she&#10;said; now she might just as well have been a child of the cellar,&#10;for no one can help his birth; and then she told the other children&#10;that she was well-born, and said that no one who was not well-born&#10;could rise in the world. It was no use to read and be industrious,&#10;for if a person was not well-born, he could never achieve anything.&#10;&#34;And those whose names end with &#39;sen,&#39;&#34; said she, &#34;can never be&#10;anything at all. We must put our arms akimbo, and make the elbow&#10;quite pointed, so as to keep these &#39;sen&#39; people at a great&#10;distance.&#34; And then she stuck out her pretty little arms, and made&#10;the elbows quite pointed, to show how it was to be done; and her&#10;little arms were very pretty, for she was a sweet-looking&#10;child.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But the little daughter of the merchant became very angry&#10;at this speech, for her father&#39;s name was Petersen, and she knew&#10;that the name ended in &#34;sen,&#34; and therefore she said as proudly as&#10;she could, &#34;But my papa can buy a hundred dollars&#39; worth of&#10;bonbons, and give them away to children. Can your papa do&#10;that?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes; and my papa,&#34; said the little daughter of the editor&#10;of a paper, &#34;my papa can put your papa and everybody&#39;s papa into&#10;the newspaper. All sorts of people are afraid of him, my mamma&#10;says, for he can do as he likes with the paper.&#34; And the little&#10;maiden looked exceedingly proud, as if she had been a real&#10;princess, who may be expected to look proud.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But outside the door, which stood ajar, was a poor boy,&#10;peeping through the crack of the door. He was of such a lowly&#10;station that he had not been allowed even to enter the room. He had&#10;been turning the spit for the cook, and she had given him&#10;permission to stand behind the door and peep in at the well-dressed&#10;children, who were having such a merry time within; and for him&#10;that was a great deal. &#34;Oh, if I could be one of them,&#34; thought he,&#10;and then he heard what was said about names, which was quite enough&#10;to make him more unhappy. His parents at home had not even a penny&#10;to spare to buy a newspaper, much less could they write in one; and&#10;worse than all, his father&#39;s name, and of course his own, ended in&#10;&#34;sen,&#34; and therefore he could never turn out well, which was a very&#10;sad thought. But after all, he had been born into the world, and&#10;the station of life had been chosen for him, therefore he must be&#10;content.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And this is what happened on that&#10;evening.&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Many years passed, and most of the children became&#10;grown-up persons.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;There stood a splendid house in the town, filled with all&#10;kinds of beautiful and valuable objects. Everybody wished to see&#10;it, and people even came in from the country round to be permitted&#10;to view the treasures it contained.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Which of the children whose prattle we have described,&#10;could call this house his own? One would suppose it very easy to&#10;guess. No, no; it is not so very easy. The house belonged to the&#10;poor little boy who had stood on that night behind the door. He had&#10;really become something great, although his name ended in&#10;&#34;sen,&#34;&#8212;for it was Thorwaldsen.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the three other children&#8212;the children of good birth,&#10;of money, and of intellectual pride,&#8212;well, they were respected and&#10;honored in the world, for they had been well provided for by birth&#10;and position, and they had no cause to reproach themselves with&#10;what they had thought and spoken on that evening long ago, for,&#10;after all, it was mere &#34;children&#39;s prattle.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Princess and the Pea'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;ONCE upon a time there was a prince who wanted to marry a&#10;princess; but she would have to be a real princess. He travelled&#10;all over the world to find one, but nowhere could he get what he&#10;wanted. There were princesses enough, but it was difficult to find&#10;out whether they were real ones. There was always something about&#10;them that was not as it should be. So he came home again and was&#10;sad, for he would have liked very much to have a real&#10;princess.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;One evening a terrible storm came on; there was thunder&#10;and lightning, and the rain poured down in torrents. Suddenly a&#10;knocking was heard at the city gate, and the old king went to open&#10;it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was a princess standing out there in front of the gate.&#10;But, good gracious! what a sight the rain and the wind had made her&#10;look. The water ran down from her hair and clothes; it ran down&#10;into the toes of her shoes and out again at the heels. And yet she&#10;said that she was a real princess.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Well, we&#39;ll soon find that out,&#34; thought the old queen.&#10;But she said nothing, went into the bed-room, took all the bedding&#10;off the bedstead, and laid a pea on the bottom; then she took&#10;twenty mattresses and laid them on the pea, and then twenty&#10;eider-down beds on top of the mattresses.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;On this the princess had to lie all night. In the morning&#10;she was asked how she had slept.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, very badly!&#34; said she. &#34;I have scarcely closed my&#10;eyes all night. Heaven only knows what was in the bed, but I was&#10;lying on something hard, so that I am black and blue all over my&#10;body. It&#39;s horrible!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Now they knew that she was a real princess because she had&#10;felt the pea right through the twenty mattresses and the twenty&#10;eider-down beds.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Nobody but a real princess could be as sensitive as&#10;that.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;So the prince took her for his wife, for now he knew that&#10;he had a real princess; and the pea was put in the museum, where it&#10;may still be seen, if no one has stolen it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;There, that is a true story.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)

His rays tremble on the&#10;white wall, as if he wished to write down on it what he can tell,&#10;what he has seen there and elsewhere during thousands of years in&#10;our rolling world. Let us hear one of his stories.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;A short time ago&#34;&#8212;the Star&#39;s &#34;short time ago&#34; is called&#10;among men &#34;centuries ago&#34;&#8212;&#34;my rays followed a young artist. It was&#10;in the city of the Popes, in the world-city, Rome. Much has been&#10;changed there in the course of time, but the changes have not come&#10;so quickly as the change from youth to old age. Then already the&#10;palace of the Caesars was a ruin, as it is now; fig trees and&#10;laurels grew among the fallen marble columns, and in the desolate&#10;bathing-halls, where the gilding still clings to the wall; the&#10;Coliseum was a gigantic ruin; the church bells sounded, the incense&#10;sent up its fragrant cloud, and through the streets marched&#10;processions with flaming tapers and glowing canopies. Holy Church&#10;was there, and art was held as a high and holy thing. In Rome lived&#10;the greatest painter in the world, Raphael; there also dwelt the&#10;first of sculptors, Michael Angelo. Even the Pope paid homage to&#10;these two, and honored them with a visit. Art was recognized and&#10;honored, and was rewarded also. But, for all that, everything great&#10;and splendid was not seen and known.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;In a narrow lane stood an old house. Once it had been a&#10;temple; a young sculptor now dwelt there. He was young and quite&#10;unknown. He certainly had friends, young artists, like himself,&#10;young in spirit, young in hopes and thoughts; they told him he was&#10;rich in talent, and an artist, but that he was foolish for having&#10;no faith in his own power; for he always broke what he had&#10;fashioned out of clay, and never completed anything; and a work&#10;must be completed if it is to be seen and to bring&#10;money.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;You are a dreamer,&#39; they went on to say to him, &#39;and&#10;that&#39;s your misfortune. But the reason of this is, that you have&#10;never lived, you have never tasted life, you have never enjoyed it&#10;in great wholesome draughts, as it ought to be enjoyed. In youth&#10;one must mingle one&#39;s own personality with life, that they may&#10;become one. Look at the great master Raphael, whom the Pope honors&#10;and the world admires. He&#39;s no despiser of wine and&#10;bread.&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;And he even appreciates the baker&#39;s daughter, the pretty&#10;Fornarina,&#39; added Angelo, one of the merriest of the young&#10;friends.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, they said a good many things of the kind, according&#10;to their age and their reason. They wanted to draw the young artist&#10;out with them into the merry wild life, the mad life as it might&#10;also be called; and at certain times he felt an inclination for it.&#10;He had warm blood, a strong imagination, and could take part in the&#10;merry chat, and laugh aloud with the rest; but what they called&#10;&#39;Raphael&#39;s merry life&#39; disappeared before him like a vapor when he&#10;saw the divine radiance that beamed forth from the pictures of the&#10;great master; and when he stood in the Vatican, before the forms of&#10;beauty which the masters had hewn out of marble thousands of years&#10;since, his breast swelled, and he felt within himself something&#10;high, something holy, something elevating, great and good, and he&#10;wished that he could produce similar forms from the blocks of&#10;marble. He wished to make a picture of that which was within him,&#10;stirring upward from his heart to the realms of the Infinite; but&#10;how, and in what form? The soft clay was fashioned under his&#10;fingers into forms of beauty, but the next day he broke what he had&#10;fashioned, according to his wont.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;One day he walked past one of those rich palaces of which&#10;Rome has many to show. He stopped before the great open portal, and&#10;beheld a garden surrounded by cloistered walks. The garden bloomed&#10;with a goodly show of the fairest roses. Great white lilies with&#10;green juicy leaves shot upward from the marble basin in which the&#10;clear water was splashing; and a form glided past, the daughter of&#10;the princely house, graceful, delicate, and wonderfully fair. Such&#10;a form of female loveliness he had never before beheld&#8212;yet stay: he&#10;had seen it, painted by Raphael, painted as a Psyche, in one of the&#10;Roman palaces. Yes, there it had been painted; but here it passed&#10;by him in living reality.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The remembrance lived in his thoughts, in his heart. He&#10;went home to his humble room, and modelled a Psyche of clay. It was&#10;the rich young Roman girl, the noble maiden; and for the first time&#10;he looked at his work with satisfaction. It had a meaning for him,&#10;for it was she. And the friends who saw his work shouted aloud for&#10;joy; they declared that this work was a manifestation of his&#10;artistic power, of which they had long been aware, and that now the&#10;world should be made aware of it too.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The clay figure was lifelike and beautiful, but it had&#10;not the whiteness or the durability of marble. So they declared&#10;that the Psyche must henceforth live in marble. He already&#10;possessed a costly block of that stone. It had been lying for&#10;years, the property of his parents, in the courtyard. Fragments of&#10;glass, climbing weeds, and remains of artichokes had gathered about&#10;it and sullied its purity; but under the surface the block was as&#10;white as the mountain snow; and from this block the Psyche was to&#10;arise.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Now, it happened one morning&#8212;the bright Star tells nothing&#10;about this, but we know it occurred&#8212;that a noble Roman company came&#10;into the narrow lane. The carriage stopped at the top of the lane,&#10;and the company proceeded on foot towards the house, to inspect the&#10;young sculptor&#39;s work, for they had heard him spoken of by chance.&#10;And who were these distinguished guests? Poor young man! or&#10;fortunate young man he might be called. The noble young lady stood&#10;in the room and smiled radiantly when her father said to her, &#34;It&#10;is your living image.&#34; That smile could not be copied, any more&#10;than the look could be reproduced, the wonderful look which she&#10;cast upon the young artist. It was a fiery look, that seemed at&#10;once to elevate and to crush him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The Psyche must be executed in marble,&#34; said the wealthy&#10;patrician. And those were words of life for the dead clay and the&#10;heavy block of marble, and words of life likewise for the&#10;deeply-moved artist. &#34;When the work is finished I will purchase&#10;it,&#34; continued the rich noble.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A new era seemed to have arisen in the poor studio. Life&#10;and cheerfulness gleamed there, and busy industry plied its work.&#10;The beaming Morning Star beheld how the work progressed. The clay&#10;itself seemed inspired since she had been there, and moulded&#10;itself, in heightened beauty, to a likeness of the well-known&#10;features.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Now I know what life is,&#34; cried the artist rejoicingly;&#10;&#34;it is Love! It is the lofty abandonment of self for the dawning of&#10;the beautiful in the soul! What my friends call life and enjoyment&#10;is a passing shadow; it is like bubbles among seething dregs, not&#10;the pure heavenly wine that consecrates us to life.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The marble block was reared in its place. The chisel&#10;struck great fragments from it; the measurements were taken, points&#10;and lines were made, the mechanical part was executed, till&#10;gradually the stone assumed a human female form, a shape of beauty,&#10;and became converted into the Psyche, fair and glorious&#8212;a divine&#10;being in human shape. The heavy stone appeared as a gliding,&#10;dancing, airy Psyche, with the heavenly innocent smile&#8212;the smile&#10;that had mirrored itself in the soul of the young&#10;artist.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Star of the roseate dawn beheld and understood what&#10;was stirring within the young man, and could read the meaning of&#10;the changing color of his cheek, of the light that flashed from his&#10;eye, as he stood busily working, reproducing what had been put into&#10;his soul from above.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Thou art a master like those masters among the ancient&#10;Greeks,&#34; exclaimed his delighted friends; &#34;soon shall the whole&#10;world admire thy Psyche.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;My Psyche!&#34; he repeated. &#34;Yes, mine. She must be mine. I,&#10;too, am an artist, like those great men who are gone. Providence&#10;has granted me the boon, and has made me the equal of that lady of&#10;noble birth.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And he knelt down and breathed a prayer of thankfulnesss&#10;to Heaven, and then he forgot Heaven for her sake&#8212;for the sake of&#10;her picture in stone&#8212;for her Psyche which stood there as if formed&#10;of snow, blushing in the morning dawn.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;He was to see her in reality, the living, graceful Psyche,&#10;whose words sounded like music in his ears. He could now carry the&#10;news into the rich palace that the marble Psyche was finished. He&#10;betook himself thither, strode through the open courtyard where the&#10;waters ran splashing from the dolphin&#39;s jaws into the marble&#10;basins, where the snowy lilies and the fresh roses bloomed in&#10;abundance. He stepped into the great lofty hall, whose walls and&#10;ceilings shone with gilding and bright colors and heraldic devices.&#10;Gayly-dressed serving-men, adorned with trappings like sleigh&#10;horses, walked to and fro, and some reclined at their ease upon the&#10;carved oak seats, as if they were the masters of the house. He told&#10;them what had brought him to the palace, and was conducted up the&#10;shining marble staircase, covered with soft carpets and adorned&#10;with many a statue. Then he went on through richly-furnished&#10;chambers, over mosaic floors, amid gorgeous pictures. All this pomp&#10;and luxury seemed to weary him; but soon he felt relieved, for the&#10;princely old master of the house received him most graciously,,&#10;almost heartily; and when he took his leave he was requested to&#10;step into the Signora&#39;s apartment, for she, too, wished to see him.&#10;The servants led him through more luxurious halls and chambers into&#10;her room, where she appeared the chief and leading&#10;ornament.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;She spoke to him. No hymn of supplication, no holy chant,&#10;could melt his soul like the sound of her voice. He took her hand&#10;and lifted it to his lips. No rose was softer, but a fire thrilled&#10;through him from this rose&#8212;a feeling of power came upon him, and&#10;words poured from his tongue&#8212;he knew not what he said. Does the&#10;crater of the volcano know that the glowing lava is pouring from&#10;it? He confessed what he felt for her. She stood before him&#10;astonished, offended, proud, with contempt in her face, an&#10;expression of disgust, as if she had suddenly touched a cold&#10;unclean reptile. Her cheeks reddened, her lips grew white, and her&#10;eyes flashed fire, though they were dark as the blackness of&#10;night.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Madman!&#34; she cried, &#34;away! begone!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And she turned her back upon him. Her beautiful face wore&#10;an expression like that of the stony countenance with the snaky&#10;locks.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Like a stricken, fainting man, he tottered down the&#10;staircase and out into the street. Like a man walking in his sleep,&#10;he found his way back to his dwelling. Then he woke up to madness&#10;and agony, and seized his hammer, swung it high in the air, and&#10;rushed forward to shatter the beautiful marble image. But, in his&#10;pain, he had not noticed that his friend Angelo stood beside him;&#10;and Angelo held back his arm with a strong grasp,&#10;crying,&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Are you mad? What are you about?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;They struggled together. Angelo was the stronger; and,&#10;with a deep sigh of exhaustion, the young artist threw himself into&#10;a chair.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What has happened?&#34; asked Angelo. &#34;Command yourself.&#10;Speak!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But what could he say? How could he explain? And as Angelo&#10;could make no sense of his friend&#39;s incoherent words, he forbore to&#10;question him further, and merely said,&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Your blood grows thick from your eternal dreaming. Be a&#10;man, as all others are, and don&#39;t go on living in ideals, for that&#10;is what drives men crazy. A jovial feast will make you sleep&#10;quietly and happily. Believe me, the time will come when you will&#10;be old, and your sinews will shrink, and then, on some fine&#10;sunshiny day, when everything is laughing and rejoicing, you will&#10;lie there a faded plant, that will grow no more. I do not live in&#10;dreams, but in reality. Come with me. Be a man!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And he drew the artist away with him. At this moment he&#10;was able to do so, for a fire ran in the blood of the young&#10;sculptor; a change had taken place in his soul; he felt a longing&#10;to tear from the old, the accustomed&#8212;to forget, if possible, his&#10;own individuality; and therefore it was that he followed&#10;Angelo.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In an out-of-the-way suburb of Rome lay a tavern much&#10;visited by artists. It was built on the ruins of some ancient&#10;baths. The great yellow citrons hung down among the dark shining&#10;leaves, and covered a part of the old reddish-yellow walls. The&#10;tavern consisted of a vaulted chamber, almost like a cavern, in the&#10;ruins. A lamp burned there before the picture of the Madonna. A&#10;great fire gleamed on the hearth, and roasting and boiling was&#10;going on there; without, under the citron trees and laurels, stood&#10;a few covered tables.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The two artists were received by their friends with shouts&#10;of welcome. Little was eaten, but much was drunk, and the spirits&#10;of the company rose. Songs were sung and ditties were played on the&#10;guitar; presently the Salterello sounded, and the merry dance&#10;began. Two young Roman girls, who sat as models to the artists,&#10;took part in the dance and in the festivity. Two charming&#10;Bacchantes were they; certainly not Psyches&#8212;not delicate, beautiful&#10;roses, but fresh, hearty, glowing carnations.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;How hot it was on that day! Even after sundown it was hot.&#10;There was fire in the blood, fire in every glance, fire everywhere.&#10;The air gleamed with gold and roses, and life seemed like gold and&#10;roses.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;At last you have joined us, for once,&#34; said his friends.&#10;&#34;Now let yourself be carried by the waves within and around&#10;you.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Never yet have I felt so well, so merry!&#34; cried the young&#10;artist. &#34;You are right&#8212;you are all of you right. I was a fool&#8212;a&#10;dreamer. Man belongs to reality, and not to fancy.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;With songs and with sounding guitars the young people&#10;returned that evening from the tavern, through the narrow streets;&#10;the two glowing carnations, daughters of the Campagna, went with&#10;them.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In Angelo&#39;s room, among a litter of colored sketches&#10;(studies) and glowing pictures, the voices sounded mellower, but&#10;not less merrily. On the ground lay many a sketch that resembled&#10;the daughters of the Campagna, in their fresh, hearty comeliness,&#10;but the two originals were far handsomer than their portraits. All&#10;the burners of the six-armed lamp flared and flamed; and the human&#10;flamed up from within, and appeared in the glare as if it were&#10;divine.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Apollo! Jupiter! I feel myself raised to our heaven&#8212;to&#10;your glory! I feel as if the blossom of life were unfolding itself&#10;in my veins at this moment!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Yes, the blossom unfolded itself, and then burst and fell,&#10;and an evil vapor arose from it, blinding the sight, leading astray&#10;the fancy; the firework of the senses went out, and it became&#10;dark.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;He was again in his own room. There he sat down on his bed&#10;and collected his thoughts.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Fie on thee!&#34; these were the words that sounded out of&#10;his mouth from the depths of his heart. &#34;Wretched man, go, begone!&#34;&#10;And a deep painful sigh burst from his bosom.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Away! begone!&#34; These, her words, the words of the living&#10;Psyche, echoed through his heart, escaped from his lips. He buried&#10;his head in the pillows, his thoughts grew confused, and he fell&#10;asleep.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the morning dawn he started up, and collected his&#10;thoughts anew. What had happened? Had all the past been a dream?&#10;The visit to her, the feast at the tavern, the evening with the&#10;purple carnations of the Campagna? No, it was all real&#8212;a reality he&#10;had never before experienced.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the purple air gleamed the bright Star, and its beams&#10;fell upon him and upon the marble Psyche. He trembled as he looked&#10;at that picture of immortality, and his glance seemed impure to&#10;him. He threw the cloth over the statue, and then touched it once&#10;more to unveil the form&#8212;but he was not able to look again at his&#10;own work.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Gloomy, quiet, absorbed in his own thoughts, he sat there&#10;through the long day; he heard nothing of what was going on around&#10;him, and no man guessed what was passing in this human&#10;soul.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And days and weeks went by, but the nights passed more&#10;slowly than the days. The flashing Star beheld him one morning as&#10;he rose, pale and trembling with fever, from his sad couch; then he&#10;stepped towards the statue, threw back the covering, took one long,&#10;sorrowful gaze at his work, and then, almost sinking beneath the&#10;burden, he dragged the statue out into the garden. In that place&#10;was an old dry well, now nothing but a hole. Into this he cast the&#10;Psyche, threw earth in above her, and covered up the spot with&#10;twigs and nettles.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Away! begone!&#34; Such was the short epitaph he&#10;spoke.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Star beheld all this from the pink morning sky, and&#10;its beam trembled upon two great tears upon the pale feverish&#10;cheeks of the young man; and soon it was said that he was sick unto&#10;death, and he lay stretched upon a bed of pain.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The convent Brother Ignatius visited him as a physician&#10;and a friend, and brought him words of comfort, of religion, and&#10;spoke to him of the peace and happiness of the church, of the&#10;sinfulness of man, of rest and mercy to be found in&#10;heaven.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the words fell like warm sunbeams upon a teeming soil.&#10;The soil smoked and sent up clouds of mist, fantastic pictures,&#10;pictures in which there was reality; and from these floating&#10;islands he looked across at human life. He found it vanity and&#10;delusion&#8212;and vanity and delusion it had been to him. They told him&#10;that art was a sorcerer, betraying us to vanity and to earthly&#10;lusts; that we are false to ourselves, unfaithful to our friends,&#10;unfaithful towards Heaven; and that the serpent was always&#10;repeating within us, &#34;Eat, and thou shalt become as&#10;God.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And it appeared to him as if now, for the first time, he&#10;knew himself, and had found the way that leads to truth and to&#10;peace. In the church was the light and the brightness of God&#8212;in the&#10;monk&#39;s cell he should find the rest through which the tree of human&#10;life might grow on into eternity.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Brother Ignatius strengthened his longings, and the&#10;determination became firm within him. A child of the world became a&#10;servant of the church&#8212;the young artist renounced the world, and&#10;retired into the cloister.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The brothers came forward affectionately to welcome him,&#10;and his inauguration was as a Sunday feast. Heaven seemed to him to&#10;dwell in the sunshine of the church, and to beam upon him from the&#10;holy pictures and from the cross. And when, in the evening, at the&#10;sunset hour, he stood in his little cell, and, opening the window,&#10;looked out upon old Rome, upon the desolated temples, and the great&#10;dead Coliseum&#8212;when he saw all this in its spring garb, when the&#10;acacias bloomed, and the ivy was fresh, and roses burst forth&#10;everywhere, and the citron and orange were in the height of their&#10;beauty, and the palm trees waved their branches&#8212;then he felt a&#10;deeper emotion than had ever yet thrilled through him. The quiet&#10;open Campagna spread itself forth towards the blue snow-covered&#10;mountains, which seemed to be painted in the air; all the outlines&#10;melting into each other, breathing peace and beauty, floating,&#10;dreaming&#8212;and all appearing like a dream!&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Yes, this world was a dream, and the dream lasts for&#10;hours, and may return for hours; but convent life is a life of&#10;years&#8212;long years, and many years.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;From within comes much that renders men sinful and impure.&#10;He fully realized the truth of this. What flames arose up in him at&#10;times! What a source of evil, of that which we would not, welled up&#10;continually! He mortified his body, but the evil came from&#10;within.&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;One day, after the lapse of many years, he met Angelo, who&#10;recognized him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Man!&#34; exclaimed Angelo. &#34;Yes, it is thou! Art thou happy&#10;now? Thou hast sinned against God, and cast away His boon from&#10;thee&#8212;hast neglected thy mission in this world! Read the parable of&#10;the intrusted talent! The MASTER, who spoke that parable, spoke the&#10;truth! What hast thou gained? What hast thou found? Dost thou not&#10;fashion for thyself a religion and a dreamy life after thine own&#10;idea, as almost all do? Suppose all this is a dream, a fair&#10;delusion!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Get thee away from me, Satan!&#34; said the monk; and he&#10;quitted Angelo.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;There is a devil, a personal devil! This day I have seen&#10;him!&#34; said the monk to himself. &#34;Once I extended a finger to him,&#10;and he took my whole hand. But now,&#34; he sighed, &#34;the evil is within&#10;me, and it is in yonder man; but it does not bow him down; he goes&#10;abroad with head erect, and enjoys his comfort; and I grasped at&#10;comfort in the consolations of religion. If it were nothing but a&#10;consolation? Supposing everything here were, like the world I have&#10;quitted, only a beautiful fancy, a delusion like the beauty of the&#10;evening clouds, like the misty blue of the distant hills!&#8212;when you&#10;approach them, they are very different! O eternity! Thou actest&#10;like the great calm ocean, that beckons us, and fills us with&#10;expectation&#8212;and when we embark upon thee, we sink, disappear, and&#10;cease to be. Delusion! away with it! begone!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And tearless, but sunk in bitter reflection, he sat upon&#10;his hard couch, and then knelt down&#8212;before whom? Before the stone&#10;cross fastened to the wall? No, it was only habit that made him&#10;take this position.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The more deeply he looked into his own heart, the blacker&#10;did the darkness seem. -&#34;Nothing within, nothing without&#8212;this life&#10;squanderied and cast away!&#34; And this thought rolled and grew like a&#10;snowball, until it seemed to crush him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I can confide my griefs to none. I may speak to none of&#10;the gnawing worm within. My secret is my prisoner; if I let the&#10;captive escape, I shall be his!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the godlike power that dwelt within him suffered and&#10;strove.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;O Lord, my Lord!&#34; he cried, in his despair, &#34;be merciful&#10;and grant me faith. I threw away the gift thou hadst vouchsafed to&#10;me, I left my mission unfulfilled. I lacked strength, and strength&#10;thou didst not give me. Immortality&#8212;the Psyche in my breast&#8212;away&#10;with it!&#8212;it shall be buried like that Psyche, the best gleam of my&#10;life; never will it arise out of its grave!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Star glowed in the roseate air, the Star that shall&#10;surely be extinguished and pass away while the soul still lives on;&#10;its trembling beam fell upon the white wall, but it wrote nothing&#10;there upon being made perfect in God, nothing of the hope of mercy,&#10;of the reliance on the divine love that thrills through the heart&#10;of the believer.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The Psyche within can never die. Shall it live in&#10;consciousness? Can the incomprehensible happen? Yes, yes. My being&#10;is incomprehensible. Thou art unfathomable, O Lord. Thy whole world&#10;is incomprehensible&#8212;a wonder-work of power, of glory and of&#10;love.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;His eyes gleamed, and then closed in death. The tolling of&#10;the church bell was the last sound that echoed above him, above the&#10;dead man; and they buried him, covering him with earth that had&#10;been brought from Jerusalem, and in which was mingled the dust of&#10;many of the pious dead.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;When years had gone by his skeleton was dug up, as the&#10;skeletons of the monks who had died before him had been; it was&#10;clad in a brown frock, a rosary was put into the bony hand, and the&#10;form was placed among the ranks of other skeletons in the cloisters&#10;of the convent. And the sun shone without, while within the censers&#10;were waved and the Mass was celebrated.&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And years rolled by.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The bones fell asunder and became mingled with others.&#10;Skulls were piled up till they formed an outer wall around the&#10;church; and there lay also his head in the burning sun, for many&#10;dead were there, and no one knew their names, and his name was&#10;forgotten also. And see, something was moving in the sunshine, in&#10;the sightless cavernous eyes! What might that be? A sparkling&#10;lizard moved about in the skull, gliding in and out through the&#10;sightless holes. The lizard now represented all the life left in&#10;that head, in which once great thoughts, bright dreams, the love of&#10;art and of the glorious, had arisen, whence hot tears had rolled&#10;down, where hope and immortality had had their being. The lizard&#10;sprang away and disappeared, and the skull itself crumbled to&#10;pieces and became dust among dust.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Centuries passed away. The bright Star gleamed unaltered,&#10;radiant and large, as it had gleamed for thousands of years, and&#10;the air glowed red with tints fresh as roses, crimson like&#10;blood.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;There, where once had stood the narrow lane containing the&#10;ruins of the temple, a nunnery was now built. A grave was being dug&#10;in the convent garden for a young nun who had died, and was to be&#10;laid in the earth this morning. The spade struck against a hard&#10;substance; it was a stone, that shone dazzling white. A block of&#10;marble soon appeared, a rounded shoulder was laid bare; and now the&#10;spade was plied with a more careful hand, and presently a female&#10;head was seen, and butterflies&#39; wings. Out of the grave in which&#10;the young nun was to be laid they lifted, in the rosy morning, a&#10;wonderful statue of a Psyche carved in white marble.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;How beautiful, how perfect it is!&#34; cried the spectators.&#10;&#34;A relic of the best period of art.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And who could the sculptor have been? No one knew; no one&#10;remembered him, except the bright star that had gleamed for&#10;thousands of years. The star had seen the course of that life on&#10;earth, and knew of the man&#39;s trials, of his weakness&#8212;in fact, that&#10;he had been but human. The man&#39;s life had passed away, his dust had&#10;been scattered abroad as dust is destined to be; but the result of&#10;his noblest striving, the glorious work that gave token of the&#10;divine element within him&#8212;the Psyche that never dies, that lives&#10;beyond posterity&#8212;the brightness even of this earthly Psyche&#10;remained here after him, and was seen and acknowledged and&#10;appreciated.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The bright Morning Star in the roseate air threw its&#10;glancing ray downward upon the Psyche, and upon the radiant&#10;countenances of the admiring spectators, who here beheld the image&#10;of the soul portrayed in marble.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;What is earthly will pass away and be forgotten, and the&#10;Star in the vast firmament knows it. What is heavenly will shine&#10;brightly through posterity; and when the ages of posterity are&#10;past, the Psyche&#8212;the soul&#8212;will still live on!&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Puppet-Show Man'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;ON board a steamer I once met an elderly man, with such a&#10;merry face that, if it was really an index of his mind, he must&#10;have been the happiest fellow in creation; and indeed he considered&#10;himself so, for I heard it from his own mouth. He was a Dane, the&#10;owner of a travelling theatre. He had all his company with him in a&#10;large box, for he was the proprietor of a puppet-show. His inborn&#10;cheerfulness, he said, had been tested by a member of the&#10;Polytechnic Institution, and the experiment had made him completely&#10;happy. I did not at first understand all this, but afterwards he&#10;explained the whole story to me; and here it is:&#8212;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I was giving a representation,&#34; he said, &#34;in the hall of&#10;the posting-house in the little town of Slagelse; there was a&#10;splendid audience, entirely juvenile excepting two respectable&#10;matrons. All at once, a person in black, of student-like&#10;appearance, entered the room, and sat down; he laughed aloud at the&#10;telling points, and applauded quite at the proper time. This was a&#10;very unusual spectator for me, and I felt anxious to know who he&#10;was. I heard that he was a member of the Polytechnic Institution in&#10;Copenhagen, who had been sent out to lecture to the people in the&#10;provinces. Punctually at eight o&#39;clock my performance closed, for&#10;children must go early to bed, and a manager must also consult the&#10;convenience of the public.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;At nine o&#39;clock the lecturer commenced his lecture and&#10;his experiments, and then I formed a part of his audience. It was&#10;wonderful both to hear and to see. The greater part of it was&#10;beyond my comprehension, but it led me to think that if we men can&#10;acquire so much, we must surely be intended to last longer than the&#10;little span which extends only to the time when we are hidden away&#10;under the earth. His experiments were quite miracles on a small&#10;scale, and yet the explanations flowed as naturally as water from&#10;his lips. At the time of Moses and the prophets, such a man would&#10;have been placed among the sages of the land; in the middle ages&#10;they would have burnt him at the stake.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;All night long I could not sleep; and the next evening&#10;when I gave another performance and the lecturer was present, I was&#10;in one of my best moods.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I once heard of an actor, who, when he had to act the&#10;part of a lover, always thought of one particular lady in the&#10;audience; he only played for her, and forgot all the rest of the&#10;house, and now the Polytechnic lecturer was my she, my only&#10;auditor, for whom alone I played.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;When the performance was over, and the puppets removed&#10;behind the curtain, the Polytechnic lecturer invited me into his&#10;room to take a glass of wine. He talked of my comedies, and I of&#10;his science, and I believe we were both equally pleased. But I had&#10;the best of it, for there was much in what he did that he could not&#10;always explain to me. For instance, why a piece of iron which is&#10;rubbed on a cylinder, should become magnetic. How does this happen?&#10;The magnetic sparks come to it,&#8212;but how? It is the same with people&#10;in the world; they are rubbed about on this spherical globe till&#10;the electric spark comes upon them, and then we have a Napoleon, or&#10;a Luther, or some one of the kind.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;The whole world is but a series of miracles,&#39; said the&#10;lecturer, &#39;but we are so accustomed to them that we call them&#10;everyday matters.&#39; And he went on explaining things to me till my&#10;skull seemed lifted from my brain, and I declared that were I not&#10;such an old fellow, I would at once become a member of the&#10;Polytechnic Institution, that I might learn to look at the bright&#10;side of everything, although I was one of the happiest of&#10;men.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;One of the happiest!&#39; said the lecturer, as if the idea&#10;pleased him; &#39;are you really happy?&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;Yes,&#39; I replied; &#39;for I am welcomed in every town, when&#10;I arrive with my company; but I certainly have one wish which&#10;sometimes weighs upon my cheerful temper like a mountain of lead. I&#10;should like to become the manager of a real theatre, and the&#10;director of a real troupe of men and women.&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;I understand,&#39; he said; &#39;you would like to have life&#10;breathed into your puppets, so that they might be living actors,&#10;and you their director. And would you then be quite&#10;happy?&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I said I believed so. But he did not; and we talked it&#10;over in all manner of ways, yet could not agree on the subject.&#10;However, the wine was excellent, and we clanked our glasses&#10;together as we drank. There must have been magic in it, or I should&#10;most certainly become tipsy; but that did not happen, for my mind&#10;seemed quite clear; and, indeed, a kind of sunshine filled the&#10;room, and beamed from the eyes of the Polytechnic lecturer. It made&#10;me think of the old stories when the gods, in their immortal youth,&#10;wandered upon this earth, and paid visits to mankind. I said so to&#10;him, and he smiled; and I could have sworn that he was one of these&#10;ancient deities in disguise, or, at all events, that he belonged to&#10;the race of the gods. The result seemed to prove I was right in my&#10;suspicions; for it was arranged that my highest wish should be&#10;granted, that my puppets were to be gifted with life, and that I&#10;was to be the manager of a real company. We drank to my success,&#10;and clanked our glasses. Then he packed all my dolls into the box,&#10;and fastened it on my back, and I felt as if I were spinning round&#10;in a circle, and presently found myself lying on the floor. I&#10;remember that quite well. And then the whole company sprang from&#10;the box. The spirit had come upon us all; the puppets had become&#10;distinguished actors&#8212;at least, so they said themselves&#8212;and I was&#10;their director.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;When all was ready for the first representation, the&#10;whole company requested permission to speak to me before appearing&#10;in public. The dancing lady said the house could not be supported&#10;unless she stood on one leg; for she was a great genius, and begged&#10;to be treated as such. The lady who acted the part of the queen&#10;expected to be treated as a queen off the stage, as well as on it,&#10;or else she said she should get out of practice. The man whose duty&#10;it was to deliver a letter gave himself as many airs as he who took&#10;the part of first lover in the piece; he declared that the inferior&#10;parts were as important as the great ones, and deserving equal&#10;consideration, as parts of an artistic whole. The hero of the piece&#10;would only play in a part containing points likely to bring down&#10;the applause of the house. The &#39;prima donna&#39; would only act when&#10;the lights were red, for she declared that a blue light did not&#10;suit her complexion. It was like a company of flies in a bottle,&#10;and I was in the bottle with them; for I was their director. My&#10;breath was taken away, my head whirled, and I was as miserable as a&#10;man could be. It was quite a novel, strange set of beings among&#10;whom I now found myself. I only wished I had them all in my box&#10;again, and that I had never been their director. So I told them&#10;roundly that, after all, they were nothing but puppets; and then&#10;they killed me. After a while I found myself lying on my bed in my&#10;room; but how I got there, or how I got away at all from the&#10;Polytechnic professor, he may perhaps know, I don&#39;t. The moon shone&#10;upon the floor, the box lay open, and the dolls were all scattered&#10;about in great confusion; but I was not idle. I jumped off the bed,&#10;and into the box they all had to go, some on their heads, some on&#10;their feet. Then I shut down the lid, and seated myself upon the&#10;box. &#39;Now you&#39;ll have to stay,&#39; said I, &#39;and I shall be cautious&#10;how I wish you flesh and blood again.&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I felt quite light, my cheerfulness had returned, and I&#10;was the happiest of mortals. The Polytechnic professor had fully&#10;cured me. I was as happy as a king, and went to sleep on the box.&#10;Next morning&#8212;correctly speaking, it was noon, for I slept&#10;remarkably late that day&#8212;I found myself still sitting there, in&#10;happy consciousness that my former wish had been a foolish one. I&#10;inquired for the Polytechnic professor; but he had disappeared like&#10;the Greek and Roman gods; from that time I have been the happiest&#10;man in the world. I am a happy director; for none of my company&#10;ever grumble, nor the public either, for I always make them merry.&#10;I can arrange my pieces just as I please. I choose out of every&#10;comedy what I like best, and no one is offended. Plays that are&#10;neglected now-a-days by the great public were ran after thirty&#10;years ago, and listened to till the tears ran down the cheeks of&#10;the audience. These are the pieces I bring forward. I place them&#10;before the little ones, who cry over them as papa and mamma used to&#10;cry thirty years ago. But I make them shorter, for the youngsters&#10;don&#39;t like long speeches; and if they have anything mournful, they&#10;like it to be over quickly.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Races'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A PRIZE, or rather two prizes, a great one and a small&#10;one, had been awarded for the greatest swiftness in running,&#8212;not in&#10;a single race, but for the whole year.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I obtained the first prize,&#34; said the hare. &#34;Justice must&#10;still be carried out, even when one has relations and good friends&#10;among the prize committee; but that the snail should have received&#10;the second prize, I consider almost an insult to myself&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No,&#34; said the fence-rail, who had been a witness at the&#10;distribution of prizes; &#34;there should be some consideration for&#10;industry and perseverance. I have heard many respectable people say&#10;so, and I can quite understand it. The snail certainly took half a&#10;year to get over the threshold of the door; but he injured himself,&#10;and broke his collar-bone by the haste he made. He gave himself up&#10;entirely to the race, and ran with his house on his back, which was&#10;all, of course, very praiseworthy; and therefore he obtained the&#10;second prize.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I think I ought to have had some consideration too,&#34; said&#10;the swallow. &#34;I should imagine no one can be swifter in soaring and&#10;flight than I am; and how far I have been! far, far&#10;away.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, that is your misfortune,&#34; said the fence-rail; &#34;you&#10;are so fickle, so unsettled; you must always be travelling about&#10;into foreign lands when the cold commences here. You have no love&#10;of fatherland in you. There can be no consideration for&#10;you.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But now, if I have been lying the whole winter in the&#10;moor,&#34; said the swallow, &#34;and suppose I slept the whole time, would&#10;that be taken into account?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Bring a certificate from the old moor-hen,&#34; said he,&#10;&#34;that you have slept away half your time in fatherland; then you&#10;will be treated with some consideration.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I deserved the first prize, and not the second,&#34; said the&#10;snail. &#34;I know so much, at least, that the hare only ran from&#10;cowardice, and because he thought there was danger in delay. I, on&#10;the other hand, made running the business of my life, and have&#10;become a cripple in the service. If any one had a first prize, it&#10;ought to have been myself. But I do not understand chattering and&#10;boasting; on the contrary, I despise it.&#34; And the snail spat at&#10;them with contempt.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I am able to affirm with word of oath, that each prize&#8212;at&#10;least, those for which I voted&#8212;was given with just and proper&#10;consideration,&#34; said the old boundary post in the wood, who was a&#10;member of the committee of judges. &#34;I always act with due order,&#10;consideration, and calculation. Seven times have I already had the&#10;honor to be present at the distribution of the prizes, and to vote;&#10;but to-day is the first time I have been able to carry out my will.&#10;I always reckon the first prize by going through the alphabet from&#10;the beginning, and the second by going through from the end. Be so&#10;kind as to give me your attention, and I will explain to you how I&#10;reckon from the beginning. The eighth letter from A is H, and there&#10;we have H for hare; therefore I awarded to the hare the first&#10;prize. The eighth letter from the end of the alphabet is S, and&#10;therefore the snail received the second prize. Next year, the&#10;letter I will have its turn for the first prize, and the letter R&#10;for the second.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I should really have voted for myself,&#34; said the mule,&#10;&#34;if I had not been one of the judges on the committee. Not only the&#10;rapidity with which advance is made, but every other quality should&#10;have due consideration; as, for instance, how much weight a&#10;candidate is able to draw; but I have not brought this quality&#10;forward now, nor the sagacity of the hare in his flight, nor the&#10;cunning with which he suddenly springs aside and doubles, to lead&#10;people on a false track, thinking he has concealed himself. No;&#10;there is something else on which more stress should be laid, and&#10;which ought not be left unnoticed. I mean that which mankind call&#10;the beautiful. It is on the beautiful that I particularly fix my&#10;eyes. I observed the well-grown ears of the hare; it is a pleasure&#10;to me to observe how long they are. It seemed as if I saw myself&#10;again in the days of my childhood; and so I voted for the&#10;hare.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Buz,&#34; said the fly; &#34;there, I&#39;m not going to make a long&#10;speech; but I wish to say something about hares. I have really&#10;overtaken more than one hare, when I have been seated on the engine&#10;in front of a railway train. I often do so. One can then so easily&#10;judge of one&#39;s own swiftness. Not long ago, I crushed the hind legs&#10;of a young hare. He had been running a long time before the engine;&#10;he had no idea that I was travelling there. At last he had to stop&#10;in his career, and the engine ran over his hind legs, and crushed&#10;them; for I set upon it. I left him lying there, and rode on&#10;farther. I call that conquering him; but I do not want the&#10;prize.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It really seems to me,&#34; thought the wild rose, though she&#10;did not express her opinion aloud&#8212;it is not in her nature to do&#10;so,&#8212;though it would have been quite as well if she had; &#34;it&#10;certainly seems to me that the sunbeam ought to have had the honor&#10;of receiving the first prize. The sunbeam flies in a few minutes&#10;along the immeasurable path from the sun to us. It arrives in such&#10;strength, that all nature awakes to loveliness and beauty; we roses&#10;blush and exhale fragrance in its presence. Our worshipful judges&#10;don&#39;t appear to have noticed this at all. Were I the sunbeam, I&#10;would give each one of them a sun stroke; but that would only make&#10;them mad, and they are mad enough already. I only hope,&#34; continued&#10;the rose, &#34;that peace may reign in the wood. It is glorious to&#10;bloom, to be fragrant, and to live; to live in story and in song.&#10;The sunbeam will outlive us all.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What is the first prize?&#34; asked the earthworm, who had&#10;overslept the time, and only now came up.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It contains a free admission to a cabbage-garden,&#34;&#10;replied the mule. &#34;I proposed that as one of the prizes. The hare&#10;most decidedly must have it; and I, as an active and thoughtful&#10;member of the committee, took especial care that the prize should&#10;be one of advantage to him; so now he is provided for. The snail&#10;can now sit on the fence, and lick up moss and sunshine. He has&#10;also been appointed one of the first judges of swiftness in racing.&#10;It is worth much to know that one of the numbers is a man of talent&#10;in the thing men call a &#39;committee.&#39; I must say I expect much in&#10;the future; we have already made such a good beginning.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Red Shoes'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;ONCE upon a time there was little girl, pretty and dainty.&#10;But in summer time she was obliged to go barefooted because she was&#10;poor, and in winter she had to wear large wooden shoes, so that her&#10;little instep grew quite red.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the middle of the village lived an old shoemaker&#39;s&#10;wife; she sat down and made, as well as she could, a pair of little&#10;shoes out of some old pieces of red cloth. They were clumsy, but&#10;she meant well, for they were intended for the little girl, whose&#10;name was Karen.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Karen received the shoes and wore them for the first time&#10;on the day of her mother&#39;s funeral. They were certainly not&#10;suitable for mourning; but she had no others, and so she put her&#10;bare feet into them and walked behind the humble coffin.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Just then a large old carriage came by, and in it sat an&#10;old lady; she looked at the little girl, and taking pity on her,&#10;said to the clergyman, &#34;Look here, if you will give me the little&#10;girl, I will take care of her.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Karen believed that this was all on account of the red&#10;shoes, but the old lady thought them hideous, and so they were&#10;burnt. Karen herself was dressed very neatly and cleanly; she was&#10;taught to read and to sew, and people said that she was pretty. But&#10;the mirror told her, &#34;You are more than pretty&#8212;you are&#10;beautiful.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;One day the Queen was travelling through that part of the&#10;country, and had her little daughter, who was a princess, with her.&#10;All the people, amongst them Karen too, streamed towards the&#10;castle, where the little princess, in fine white clothes, stood&#10;before the window and allowed herself to be stared at. She wore&#10;neither a train nor a golden crown, but beautiful red morocco&#10;shoes; they were indeed much finer than those which the shoemaker&#39;s&#10;wife had sewn for little Karen. There is really nothing in the&#10;world that can be compared to red shoes!&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Karen was now old enough to be confirmed; she received&#10;some new clothes, and she was also to have some new shoes. The rich&#10;shoemaker in the town took the measure of her little foot in his&#10;own room, in which there stood great glass cases full of pretty&#10;shoes and white slippers. It all looked very lovely, but the old&#10;lady could not see very well, and therefore did not get much&#10;pleasure out of it. Amongst the shoes stood a pair of red ones,&#10;like those which the princess had worn. How beautiful they were!&#10;and the shoemaker said that they had been made for a count&#39;s&#10;daughter, but that they had not fitted her.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I suppose they are of shiny leather?&#34; asked the old lady.&#10;&#34;They shine so.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, they do shine,&#34; said Karen. They fitted her, and&#10;were bought. But the old lady knew nothing of their being red, for&#10;she would never have allowed Karen to be confirmed in red shoes, as&#10;she was now to be.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Everybody looked at her feet, and the whole of the way&#10;from the church door to the choir it seemed to her as if even the&#10;ancient figures on the monuments, in their stiff collars and long&#10;black robes, had their eyes fixed on her red shoes. It was only of&#10;these that she thought when the clergyman laid his hand upon her&#10;head and spoke of the holy baptism, of the covenant with God, and&#10;told her that she was now to be a grown-up Christian. The organ&#10;pealed forth solemnly, and the sweet children&#39;s voices mingled with&#10;that of their old leader; but Karen thought only of her red shoes.&#10;In the afternoon the old lady heard from everybody that Karen had&#10;worn red shoes. She said that it was a shocking thing to do, that&#10;it was very improper, and that Karen was always to go to church in&#10;future in black shoes, even if they were old.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;On the following Sunday there was Communion. Karen looked&#10;first at the black shoes, then at the red ones&#8212;looked at the red&#10;ones again, and put them on.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The sun was shining gloriously, so Karen and the old lady&#10;went along the footpath through the corn, where it was rather&#10;dusty.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;At the church door stood an old crippled soldier leaning&#10;on a crutch; he had a wonderfully long beard, more red than white,&#10;and he bowed down to the ground and asked the old lady whether he&#10;might wipe her shoes. Then Karen put out her little foot too. &#34;Dear&#10;me, what pretty dancing-shoes!&#34; said the soldier. &#34;Sit fast, when&#10;you dance,&#34; said he, addressing the shoes, and slapping the soles&#10;with his hand.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The old lady gave the soldier some money and then went&#10;with Karen into the church.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And all the people inside looked at Karen&#39;s red shoes, and&#10;all the figures gazed at them; when Karen knelt before the altar&#10;and put the golden goblet to her mouth, she thought only of the red&#10;shoes. It seemed to her as though they were swimming about in the&#10;goblet, and she forgot to sing the psalm, forgot to say the &#34;Lord&#39;s&#10;Prayer.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Now every one came out of church, and the old lady stepped&#10;into her carriage. But just as Karen was lifting up her foot to get&#10;in too, the old soldier said: &#34;Dear me, what pretty dancing shoes!&#34;&#10;and Karen could not help it, she was obliged to dance a few steps;&#10;and when she had once begun, her legs continued to dance. It seemed&#10;as if the shoes had got power over them. She danced round the&#10;church corner, for she could not stop; the coachman had to run&#10;after her and seize her. He lifted her into the carriage, but her&#10;feet continued to dance, so that she kicked the good old lady&#10;violently. At last they took off her shoes, and her legs were at&#10;rest.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;At home the shoes were put into the cupboard, but Karen&#10;could not help looking at them.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Now the old lady fell ill, and it was said that she would&#10;not rise from her bed again. She had to be nursed and waited upon,&#10;and this was no one&#39;s duty more than Karen&#39;s. But there was a grand&#10;ball in the town, and Karen was invited. She looked at the red&#10;shoes, saying to herself that there was no sin in doing that; she&#10;put the red shoes on, thinking there was no harm in that either;&#10;and then she went to the ball; and commenced to dance.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But when she wanted to go to the right, the shoes danced&#10;to the left, and when she wanted to dance up the room, the shoes&#10;danced down the room, down the stairs through the street, and out&#10;through the gates of the town. She danced, and was obliged to&#10;dance, far out into the dark wood. Suddenly something shone up&#10;among the trees, and she believed it was the moon, for it was a&#10;face. But it was the old soldier with the red beard; he sat there&#10;nodding his head and said: &#34;Dear me, what pretty dancing&#10;shoes!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;She was frightened, and wanted to throw the red shoes&#10;away; but they stuck fast. She tore off her stockings, but the&#10;shoes had grown fast to her feet. She danced and was obliged to go&#10;on dancing over field and meadow, in rain and sunshine, by night&#10;and by day&#8212;but by night it was most horrible.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;She danced out into the open churchyard; but the dead&#10;there did not dance. They had something better to do than that. She&#10;wanted to sit down on the pauper&#39;s grave where the bitter fern&#10;grows; but for her there was neither peace nor rest. And as she&#10;danced past the open church door she saw an angel there in long&#10;white robes, with wings reaching from his shoulders down to the&#10;earth; his face was stern and grave, and in his hand he held a&#10;broad shining sword.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Dance you shall,&#34; said he, &#34;dance in your red shoes till&#10;you are pale and cold, till your skin shrivels up and you are a&#10;skeleton! Dance you shall, from door to door, and where proud and&#10;wicked children live you shall knock, so that they may hear you and&#10;fear you! Dance you shall, dance&#8212;!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Mercy!&#34; cried Karen. But she did not hear what the angel&#10;answered, for the shoes carried her through the gate into the&#10;fields, along highways and byways, and unceasingly she had to&#10;dance.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;One morning she danced past a door that she knew well;&#10;they were singing a psalm inside, and a coffin was being carried&#10;out covered with flowers. Then she knew that she was forsaken by&#10;every one and damned by the angel of God.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;She danced, and was obliged to go on dancing through the&#10;dark night. The shoes bore her away over thorns and stumps till she&#10;was all torn and bleeding; she danced away over the heath to a&#10;lonely little house. Here, she knew, lived the executioner; and she&#10;tapped with her finger at the window and said:&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Come out, come out! I cannot come in, for I must&#10;dance.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the executioner said: &#34;I don&#39;t suppose you know who I&#10;am. I strike off the heads of the wicked, and I notice that my axe&#10;is tingling to do so.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Don&#39;t cut off my head!&#34; said Karen, &#34;for then I could not&#10;repent of my sin. But cut off my feet with the red&#10;shoes.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And then she confessed all her sin, and the executioner&#10;struck off her feet with the red shoes; but the shoes danced away&#10;with the little feet across the field into the deep&#10;forest.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And he carved her a pair of wooden feet and some crutches,&#10;and taught her a psalm which is always sung by sinners; she kissed&#10;the hand that guided the axe, and went away over the&#10;heath.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Now, I have suffered enough for the red shoes,&#34; she said;&#10;&#34;I will go to church, so that people can see me.&#34; And she went&#10;quickly up to the church-door; but when she came there, the red&#10;shoes were dancing before her, and she was frightened, and turned&#10;back.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;During the whole week she was sad and wept many bitter&#10;tears, but when Sunday came again she said: &#34;Now I have suffered&#10;and striven enough. I believe I am quite as good as many of those&#10;who sit in church and give themselves airs.&#34; And so she went boldly&#10;on; but she had not got farther than the churchyard gate when she&#10;saw the red shoes dancing along before her. Then she became&#10;terrified, and turned back and repented right heartily of her&#10;sin.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;She went to the parsonage, and begged that she might be&#10;taken into service there. She would be industrious, she said, and&#10;do everything that she could; she did not mind about the wages as&#10;long as she had a roof over her, and was with good people. The&#10;pastor&#39;s wife had pity on her, and took her into service. And she&#10;was industrious and thoughtful. She sat quiet and listened when the&#10;pastor read aloud from the Bible in the evening. All the children&#10;liked her very much, but when they spoke about dress and grandeur&#10;and beauty she would shake her head.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;On the following Sunday they all went to church, and she&#10;was asked whether she wished to go too; but, with tears in her&#10;eyes, she looked sadly at her crutches. And then the others went to&#10;hear God&#39;s Word, but she went alone into her little room; this was&#10;only large enough to hold the bed and a chair. Here she sat down&#10;with her hymn-book, and as she was reading it with a pious mind,&#10;the wind carried the notes of the organ over to her from the&#10;church, and in tears she lifted up her face and said: &#34;O God! help&#10;me!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the sun shone so brightly, and right before her stood&#10;an angel of God in white robes; it was the same one whom she had&#10;seen that night at the church-door. He no longer carried the sharp&#10;sword, but a beautiful green branch, full of roses; with this he&#10;touched the ceiling, which rose up very high, and where he had&#10;touched it there shone a golden star. He touched the walls, which&#10;opened wide apart, and she saw the organ which was pealing forth;&#10;she saw the pictures of the old pastors and their wives, and the&#10;congregation sitting in the polished chairs and singing from their&#10;hymn-books. The church itself had come to the poor girl in her&#10;narrow room, or the room had gone to the church. She sat in the pew&#10;with the rest of the pastor&#39;s household, and when they had finished&#10;the hymn and looked up, they nodded and said, &#34;It was right of you&#10;to come, Karen.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It was mercy,&#34; said she.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The organ played and the children&#39;s voices in the choir&#10;sounded soft and lovely. The bright warm sunshine streamed through&#10;the window into the pew where Karen sat, and her heart became so&#10;filled with it, so filled with peace and joy, that it broke. Her&#10;soul flew on the sunbeams to Heaven, and no one was there who asked&#10;after the Red Shoes.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;Everything in the Right Place'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;IT is more than a hundred years ago! At the border of the&#10;wood, near a large lake, stood the old mansion: deep ditches&#10;surrounded it on every side, in which reeds and bulrushes grew.&#10;Close by the drawbridge, near the gate, there was an old willow&#10;tree, which bent over the reeds.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;From the narrow pass came the sound of bugles and the&#10;trampling of horses&#39; feet; therefore a little girl who was watching&#10;the geese hastened to drive them away from the bridge, before the&#10;whole hunting party came galloping up; they came, however, so&#10;quickly, that the girl, in order to avoid being run over, placed&#10;herself on one of the high corner-stones of the bridge. She was&#10;still half a child and very delicately built; she had bright blue&#10;eyes, and a gentle, sweet expression. But such things the baron did&#10;not notice; while he was riding past the little goose-girl, he&#10;reversed his hunting crop, and in rough play gave her such a push&#10;with it that she fell backward into the ditch.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Everything in the right place!&#34; he cried. &#34;Into the ditch&#10;with you.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then he burst out laughing, for that he called fun; the&#10;others joined in&#8212;the whole party shouted and cried, while the&#10;hounds barked.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;While the poor girl was falling she happily caught one of&#10;the branches of the willow tree, by the help of which she held&#10;herself over the water, and as soon as the baron with his company&#10;and the dogs had disappeared through the gate, the girl endeavoured&#10;to scramble up, but the branch broke off, and she would have fallen&#10;backward among the rushes, had not a strong hand from above seized&#10;her at this moment. It was the hand of a pedlar; he had witnessed&#10;what had happened from a short distance, and now hastened to assist&#10;her.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Everything in the right place,&#34; he said, imitating the&#10;noble baron, and pulling the little maid up to the dry ground. He&#10;wished to put the branch back in the place it had been broken off,&#10;but it is not possible to put everything in the right place;&#34;&#10;therefore he stuck the branch into the soft ground.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Grow and thrive if you can, and produce a good flute for&#10;them yonder at the mansion,&#34; he said; it would have given him great&#10;pleasure to see the noble baron and his companions well thrashed.&#10;Then he entered the castle&#8212;but not the banqueting hall; he was too&#10;humble for that. No; he went to the servants&#39; hall. The&#10;men-servants and maids looked over his stock of articles and&#10;bargained with him; loud crying and screaming were heard from the&#10;master&#39;s table above: they called it singing&#8212;indeed, they did their&#10;best. Laughter and the howls of dogs were heard through the open&#10;windows: there they were feasting and revelling; wine and strong&#10;old ale were foaming in the glasses and jugs; the favourite dogs&#10;ate with their masters; now and then the squires kissed one of&#10;these animals, after having wiped its mouth first with the&#10;tablecloth. They ordered the pedlar to come up, but only to make&#10;fun of him. The wine had got into their heads, and reason had left&#10;them. They poured beer into a stocking that he could drink with&#10;them, but quick. That&#39;s what they called fun, and it made them&#10;laugh. Then meadows, peasants, and farmyards were staked on one&#10;card and lost.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Everything in the right place!&#34; the pedlar said when he&#10;had at last safely got out of Sodom and Gomorrah, as he called it.&#10;&#34;The open high road is my right place; up there I did not feel at&#10;ease.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The little maid, who was still watching the geese, nodded&#10;kindly to him as he passed through the gate.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Days and weeks passed, and it was seen that the broken&#10;willow-branch which the peddlar had stuck into the ground near the&#10;ditch remained fresh and green&#8212;nay, it even put forth fresh twigs;&#10;the little goose-girl saw that the branch had taken root, and was&#10;very pleased; the tree, so she said, was now her tree. While the&#10;tree was advancing, everything else at the castle was going&#10;backward, through feasting and gambling, for these are two rollers&#10;upon which nobody stands safely. Less than six years afterwards the&#10;baron passed out of his castle-gate a poor beggar, while the&#10;baronial seat had been bought by a rich tradesman. He was the very&#10;pedlar they had made fun of and poured beer into a stocking for him&#10;to drink; but honesty and industry bring one forward, and now the&#10;pedlar was the possessor of the baronial estate. From that time&#10;forward no card-playing was permitted there.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That&#39;s a bad pastime,&#34; he said; &#34;when the devil saw the&#10;Bible for the first time he wanted to produce a caricature in&#10;opposition to it, and invented card-playing.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The new proprietor of the estate took a wife, and whom did&#10;he take?&#8212;The little goose-girl, who had always remained good and&#10;kind, and who looked as beautiful in her new clothes as if she had&#10;been a lady of high birth. And how did all this come about? That&#10;would be too long a tale to tell in our busy time, but it really&#10;happened, and the most important events have yet to be&#10;told.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was pleasant and cheerful to live in the old place now:&#10;the mother superintended the household, and the father looked after&#10;things out-of-doors, and they were indeed very&#10;prosperous.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Where honesty leads the way, prosperity is sure to follow.&#10;The old mansion was repaired and painted, the ditches were cleaned&#10;and fruit-trees planted; all was homely and pleasant, and the&#10;floors were as white and shining as a pasteboard. In the long&#10;winter evenings the mistress and her maids sat at the&#10;spinning-wheel in the large hall; every Sunday the counsellor&#8212;this&#10;title the pedlar had obtained, although only in his old days&#8212;read&#10;aloud a portion from the Bible. The children (for they had&#10;children) all received the best education, but they were not all&#10;equally clever, as is the case in all families.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the meantime the willow tree near the drawbridge had&#10;grown up into a splendid tree, and stood there, free, and was never&#10;clipped. &#34;It is our genealogical tree,&#34; said the old people to&#10;their children, &#34;and therefore it must be honoured.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A hundred years had elapsed. It was in our own days; the&#10;lake had been transformed into marsh land; the whole baronial seat&#10;had, as it were, disappeared. A pool of water near some ruined&#10;walls was the only remainder of the deep ditches; and here stood a&#10;magnificent old tree with overhanging branches&#8212;that was the&#10;genealogical tree. Here it stood, and showed how beautiful a willow&#10;can look if one does not interfere with it. The trunk, it is true,&#10;was cleft in the middle from the root to the crown; the storms had&#10;bent it a little, but it still stood there, and out of every&#10;crevice and cleft, in which wind and weather had carried mould,&#10;blades of grass and flowers sprang forth. Especially above, where&#10;the large boughs parted, there was quite a hanging garden, in which&#10;wild raspberries and hart&#39;s-tongue ferns throve, and even a little&#10;mistletoe had taken root, and grew gracefully in the old willow&#10;branches, which were reflected in the dark water beneath when the&#10;wind blew the chickweed into the corner of the pool. A footpath&#10;which led across the fields passed close by the old tree. High up,&#10;on the woody hillside, stood the new mansion. It had a splendid&#10;view, and was large and magnificent; its window panes were so clear&#10;that one might have thought there were none there at all. The large&#10;flight of steps which led to the entrance looked like a bower&#10;covered with roses and broad-leaved plants. The lawn was as green&#10;as if each blade of grass was cleaned separately morning and&#10;evening. Inside, in the hall, valuable oil paintings were hanging&#10;on the walls. Here stood chairs and sofas covered with silk and&#10;velvet, which could be easily rolled about on castors; there were&#10;tables with polished marble tops, and books bound in morocco with&#10;gilt edges. Indeed, well-to-do and distinguished people lived here;&#10;it was the dwelling of the baron and his family. Each article was&#10;in keeping with its surroundings. &#34;Everything in the right place&#34;&#10;was the motto according to which they also acted here, and&#10;therefore all the paintings which had once been the honour and&#10;glory of the old mansion were now hung up in the passage which led&#10;to the servants&#39; rooms. It was all old lumber, especially two&#10;portraits&#8212;one representing a man in a scarlet coat with a wig, and&#10;the other a lady with powdered and curled hair holding a rose in&#10;her hand, each of them being surrounded by a large wreath of willow&#10;branches. Both portraits had many holes in them, because the&#10;baron&#39;s sons used the two old people as targets for their&#10;crossbows. They represented the counsellor and his wife, from whom&#10;the whole family descended. &#34;But they did not properly belong to&#10;our family,&#34; said one of the boys; &#34;he was a pedlar and she kept&#10;the geese. They were not like papa and mamma.&#34; The portraits were&#10;old lumber, and &#34;everything in its right place.&#34; That was why the&#10;great-grandparents had been hung up in the passage leading to the&#10;servants&#39; rooms.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The son of the village pastor was tutor at the mansion.&#10;One day he went for a walk across the fields with his young pupils&#10;and their elder sister, who had lately been confirmed. They walked&#10;along the road which passed by the old willow tree, and while they&#10;were on the road she picked a bunch of field-flowers. &#34;Everything&#10;in the right place,&#34; and indeed the bunch looked very beautiful. At&#10;the same time she listened to all that was said, and she very much&#10;liked to hear the pastor&#39;s son speak about the elements and of the&#10;great men and women in history. She had a healthy mind, noble in&#10;thought and deed, and with a heart full of love for everything that&#10;God had created. They stopped at the old willow tree, as the&#10;youngest of the baron&#39;s sons wished very much to have a flute from&#10;it, such as had been cut for him from other willow trees; the&#10;pastor&#39;s son broke a branch off. &#34;Oh, pray do not do it!&#34; said the&#10;young lady; but it was already done. &#34;That is our famous old tree.&#10;I love it very much. They often laugh at me at home about it, but&#10;that does not matter. There is a story attached to this tree.&#34; And&#10;now she told him all that we already know about the tree&#8212;the old&#10;mansion, the pedlar and the goose-girl who had met there for the&#10;first time, and had become the ancestors of the noble family to&#10;which the young lady belonged.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;They did not like to be knighted, the good old people,&#34;&#10;she said; &#34;their motto was &#39;everything in the right place,&#39; and it&#10;would not be right, they thought, to purchase a title for money. My&#10;grandfather, the first baron, was their son. They say he was a very&#10;learned man, a great favourite with the princes and princesses, and&#10;was invited to all court festivities. The others at home love him&#10;best; but, I do not know why, there seemed to me to be something&#10;about the old couple that attracts my heart! How homely, how&#10;patriarchal, it must have been in the old mansion, where the&#10;mistress sat at the spinning-wheel with her maids, while her&#10;husband read aloud out of the Bible!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;They must have been excellent, sensible people,&#34; said the&#10;pastor&#39;s son. And with this the conversation turned naturally to&#10;noblemen and commoners; from the manner in which the tutor spoke&#10;about the significance of being noble, it seemed almost as if he&#10;did not belong to a commoner&#39;s family.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It is good fortune to be of a family who have&#10;distinguished themselves, and to possess as it were a spur in&#10;oneself to advance to all that is good. It is a splendid thing to&#10;belong to a noble family, whose name serves as a card of admission&#10;to the highest circles. Nobility is a distinction; it is a gold&#10;coin that bears the stamp of its own value. It is the fallacy of&#10;the time, and many poets express it, to say that all that is noble&#10;is bad and stupid, and that, on the contrary, the lower one goes&#10;among the poor, the more brilliant virtues one finds. I do not&#10;share this opinion, for it is wrong. In the upper classes one sees&#10;many touchingly beautiful traits; my own mother has told me of&#10;such, and I could mention several. One day she was visiting a&#10;nobleman&#39;s house in town; my grandmother, I believe, had been the&#10;lady&#39;s nurse when she was a child. My mother and the nobleman were&#10;alone in the room, when he suddenly noticed an old woman on&#10;crutches come limping into the courtyard; she came every Sunday to&#10;carry a gift away with her.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;There is the poor old woman,&#39; said the nobleman; &#39;it is&#10;so difficult for her to walk.&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;My mother had hardly understood what he said before he&#10;disappeared from the room, and went downstairs, in order to save&#10;her the troublesome walk for the gift she came to fetch. Of course&#10;this is only a little incident, but it has its good sound like the&#10;poor widow&#39;s two mites in the Bible, the sound which echoes in the&#10;depth of every human heart; and this is what the poet ought to show&#10;and point out&#8212;more especially in our own time he ought to sing of&#10;this; it does good, it mitigates and reconciles! But when a man,&#10;simply because he is of noble birth and possesses a genealogy,&#10;stands on his hind legs and neighs in the street like an Arabian&#10;horse, and says when a commoner has been in a room: &#39;Some people&#10;from the street have been here,&#39; there nobility is decaying; it has&#10;become a mask of the kind that Thespis created, and it is amusing&#10;when such a person is exposed in satire.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Such was the tutor&#39;s speech; it was a little long, but&#10;while he delivered it he had finished cutting the flute.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;There was a large party at the mansion; many guests from&#10;the neighbourhood and from the capital had arrived. There were&#10;ladies with tasteful and with tasteless dresses; the big hall was&#10;quite crowded with people. The clergymen stood humbly together in a&#10;corner, and looked as if they were preparing for a funeral, but it&#10;was a festival&#8212;only the amusement had not yet begun. A great&#10;concert was to take place, and that is why the baron&#39;s young son&#10;had brought his willow flute with him; but he could not make it&#10;sound, nor could his father, and therefore the flute was good for&#10;nothing.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;There was music and songs of the kind which delight most&#10;those that perform them; otherwise quite charming!&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Are you an artist?&#34; said a cavalier, the son of his&#10;father; &#34;you play on the flute, you have made it yourself; it is&#10;genius that rules&#8212;the place of honour is due to you.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Certainly not! I only advance with the time, and that of&#10;course one can&#39;t help.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I hope you will delight us all with the little&#10;instrument&#8212;will you not?&#34; Thus saying he handed to the tutor the&#10;flute which had been cut from the willow tree by the pool; and then&#10;announced in a loud voice that the tutor wished to perform a solo&#10;on the flute. They wished to tease him&#8212;that was evident, and&#10;therefore the tutor declined to play, although he could do so very&#10;well. They urged and requested him, however, so long, that at last&#10;he took up the flute and placed it to his lips.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;That was a marvellous flute! Its sound was as thrilling as&#10;the whistle of a steam engine; in fact it was much stronger, for it&#10;sounded and was heard in the yard, in the garden, in the wood, and&#10;many miles round in the country; at the same time a storm rose and&#10;roared; &#34;Everything in the right place.&#34; And with this the baron,&#10;as if carried by the wind, flew out of the hall straight into the&#10;shepherd&#39;s cottage, and the shepherd flew&#8212;not into the hall,&#10;thither he could not come&#8212;but into the servants&#39; hall, among the&#10;smart footmen who were striding about in silk stockings; these&#10;haughty menials looked horror-struck that such a person ventured to&#10;sit at table with them. But in the hall the baron&#39;s daughter flew&#10;to the place of honour at the end of the table&#8212;she was worthy to&#10;sit there; the pastor&#39;s son had the seat next to her; the two sat&#10;there as if they were a bridal pair. An old Count, belonging to one&#10;of the oldest families of the country, remained untouched in his&#10;place of honour; the flute was just, and it is one&#39;s duty to be so.&#10;The sharp-tongued cavalier who had caused the flute to be played,&#10;and who was the child of his parents, flew headlong into the&#10;fowl-house, but not he alone.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The flute was heard at the distance of a mile, and strange&#10;events took place. A rich banker&#39;s family, who were driving in a&#10;coach and four, were blown out of it, and could not even find room&#10;behind it with their footmen. Two rich farmers who had in our days&#10;shot up higher than their own corn-fields, were flung into the&#10;ditch; it was a dangerous flute. Fortunately it burst at the first&#10;sound, and that was a good thing, for then it was put back into its&#10;owner&#39;s pocket&#8212;&#34;its right place.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The next day, nobody spoke a word about what had taken&#10;place; thus originated the phrase, &#34;to pocket the flute.&#34;&#10;Everything was again in its usual order, except that the two old&#10;pictures of the peddlar and the goose-girl were hanging in the&#10;banqueting-hall. There they were on the wall as if blown up there;&#10;and as a real expert said that they were painted by a master&#39;s&#10;hand, they remained there and were restored. &#34;Everything in the&#10;right place,&#34; and to this it will come. Eternity is long, much&#10;longer indeed than this story.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)

The winged&#10;songster serenades the fragrant flowers.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Not far from Smyrna, where the merchant drives his loaded&#10;camels, proudly arching their long necks as they journey beneath&#10;the lofty pines over holy ground, I saw a hedge of roses. The&#10;turtle-dove flew among the branches of the tall trees, and as the&#10;sunbeams fell upon her wings, they glistened as if they were&#10;mother-of-pearl. On the rose-bush grew a flower, more beautiful&#10;than them all, and to her the nightingale sung of his woes; but the&#10;rose remained silent, not even a dewdrop lay like a tear of&#10;sympathy on her leaves. At last she bowed her head over a heap of&#10;stones, and said, &#34;Here rests the greatest singer in the world;&#10;over his tomb will I spread my fragrance, and on it I will let my&#10;leaves fall when the storm scatters them. He who sung of Troy&#10;became earth, and from that earth I have sprung. I, a rose from the&#10;grave of Homer, am too lofty to bloom for a nightingale.&#34; Then the&#10;nightingale sung himself to death. A camel-driver came by, with his&#10;loaded camels and his black slaves; his little son found the dead&#10;bird, and buried the lovely songster in the grave of the great&#10;Homer, while the rose trembled in the wind.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The evening came, and the rose wrapped her leaves more&#10;closely round her, and dreamed: and this was her dream.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was a fair sunshiny day; a crowd of strangers drew near&#10;who had undertaken a pilgrimage to the grave of Homer. Among the&#10;strangers was a minstrel from the north, the home of the clouds and&#10;the brilliant lights of the aurora borealis. He plucked the rose&#10;and placed it in a book, and carried it away into a distant part of&#10;the world, his fatherland. The rose faded with grief, and lay&#10;between the leaves of the book, which he opened in his own home,&#10;saying, &#34;Here is a rose from the grave of Homer.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the flower awoke from her dream, and trembled in the&#10;wind. A drop of dew fell from the leaves upon the singer&#39;s grave.&#10;The sun rose, and the flower bloomed more beautiful than ever. The&#10;day was hot, and she was still in her own warm Asia. Then footsteps&#10;approached, strangers, such as the rose had seen in her dream, came&#10;by, and among them was a poet from the north; he plucked the rose,&#10;pressed a kiss upon her fresh mouth, and carried her away to the&#10;home of the clouds and the northern lights. Like a mummy, the&#10;flower now rests in his &#34;Iliad,&#34; and, as in her dream, she hears&#10;him say, as he opens the book, &#34;Here is a rose from the grave of&#10;Homer.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)

That does not excite expectation.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The following year the snail lay in almost the same spot,&#10;in the sunshine under the rose-tree, which was again budding and&#10;bearing roses as fresh and beautiful as ever. The snail crept half&#10;out of his shell, stretched out his horns, and drew them in&#10;again.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Everything is just as it was last year! No progress at&#10;all; the rose-tree sticks to its roses and gets no&#10;farther.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The summer and the autumn passed; the rose-tree bore roses&#10;and buds till the snow fell and the weather became raw and wet;&#10;then it bent down its head, and the snail crept into the&#10;ground.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A new year began; the roses made their appearance, and the&#10;snail made his too.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You are an old rose-tree now,&#34; said the snail. &#34;You must&#10;make haste and die. You have given the world all that you had in&#10;you; whether it was of much importance is a question that I have&#10;not had time to think about. But this much is clear and plain, that&#10;you have not done the least for your inner development, or you&#10;would have produced something else. Have you anything to say in&#10;defence? You will now soon be nothing but a stick. Do you&#10;understand what I say?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You frighten me,&#34; said the rose&#8212;tree. &#34;I have never&#10;thought of that.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No, you have never taken the trouble to think at all.&#10;Have you ever given yourself an account why you bloomed, and how&#10;your blooming comes about&#8212;why just in that way and in no&#10;other?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No,&#34; said the rose-tree. &#34;I bloom in gladness, because I&#10;cannot do otherwise. The sun shone and warmed me, and the air&#10;refreshed me; I drank the clear dew and the invigorating rain. I&#10;breathed and I lived! Out of the earth there arose a power within&#10;me, whilst from above I also received strength; I felt an&#10;ever-renewed and ever-increasing happiness, and therefore I was&#10;obliged to go on blooming. That was my life; I could not do&#10;otherwise.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You have led a very easy life,&#34; remarked the&#10;snail.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Certainly. Everything was given me,&#34; said the rose-tree.&#10;&#34;But still more was given to you. Yours is one of those&#10;deep-thinking natures, one of those highly gifted minds that&#10;astonishes the world.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I have not the slightest intention of doing so,&#34; said the&#10;snail. &#34;The world is nothing to me. What have I to do with the&#10;world? I have enough to do with myself, and enough in&#10;myself&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But must we not all here on earth give up our best parts&#10;to others, and offer as much as lies in our power? It is true, I&#10;have only given roses. But you&#8212;you who are so richly endowed&#8212;what&#10;have you given to the world? What will you give it?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What have I given? What am I going to give? I spit at it;&#10;it&#39;s good for nothing, and does not concern me. For my part, you&#10;may go on bearing roses; you cannot do anything else. Let the hazel&#10;bush bear nuts, and the cows and sheep give milk; they have each&#10;their public. I have mine in myself. I retire within myself and&#10;there I stop. The world is nothing to me.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;With this the snail withdrew into his house and blocked up&#10;the entrance.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That&#39;s very sad,&#34; said the rose tree. &#34;I cannot creep&#10;into myself, however much I might wish to do so; I have to go on&#10;bearing roses. Then they drop their leaves, which are blown away by&#10;the wind. But I once saw how a rose was laid in the mistress&#39;s&#10;hymn-book, and how one of my roses found a place in the bosom of a&#10;young beautiful girl, and how another was kissed by the lips of a&#10;child in the glad joy of life. That did me good; it was a real&#10;blessing. Those are my recollections, my life.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the rose tree went on blooming in innocence, while the&#10;snail lay idling in his house&#8212;the world was nothing to&#10;him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Years passed by.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The snail had turned to earth in the earth, and the rose&#10;tree too. Even the souvenir rose in the hymn-book was faded, but in&#10;the garden there were other rose trees and other snails. The latter&#10;crept into their houses and spat at the world, for it did not&#10;concern them.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Shall we read the story all over again? It will be just&#10;the same.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Story of a Mother'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A MOTHER sat by her little child; she was very sad, for&#10;she feared it would die. It was quite pale, and its little eyes&#10;were closed, and sometimes it drew a heavy deep breath, almost like&#10;a sigh; and then the mother gazed more sadly than ever on the poor&#10;little creature. Some one knocked at the door, and a poor old man&#10;walked in. He was wrapped in something that looked like a great&#10;horse-cloth; and he required it truly to keep him warm, for it was&#10;cold winter; the country everywhere lay covered with snow and ice,&#10;and the wind blew so sharply that it cut one&#39;s face. The little&#10;child had dozed off to sleep for a moment, and the mother, seeing&#10;that the old man shivered with the cold, rose and placed a small&#10;mug of beer on the stove to warm for him. The old man sat and&#10;rocked the cradle; and the mother seated herself on a chair near&#10;him, and looked at her sick child who still breathed heavily, and&#10;took hold of its little hand.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You think I shall keep him, do you not?&#34; she said. &#34;Our&#10;all-merciful God will surely not take him away from me.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The old man, who was indeed Death himself, nodded his head&#10;in a peculiar manner, which might have signified either Yes, or No;&#10;and the mother cast down her eyes, while the tears rolled down her&#10;cheeks. Then her head became heavy, for she had not closed her eyes&#10;for three days and nights, and she slept, but only for a moment.&#10;Shivering with cold, she started up and looked round the room. The&#10;old man was gone, and her child&#8212;it was gone too!&#8212;the old man had&#10;taken it with him. In the corner of the room the old clock began to&#10;strike; &#34;whirr&#34; went the chains, the heavy weight sank to the&#10;ground, and the clock stopped; and the poor mother rushed out of&#10;the house calling for her child. Out in the snow sat a woman in&#10;long black garments, and she said to the mother, &#34;Death has been&#10;with you in your room. I saw him hastening away with your little&#10;child; he strides faster than the wind, and never brings back what&#10;he has taken away.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Only tell me which way he has gone,&#34; said the mother;&#10;tell me the way, I will find him.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I know the way,&#34; said the woman in the black garments;&#10;&#34;but before I tell you, you must sing to me all the songs that you&#10;have sung to your child; I love these songs, I have heard them&#10;before. I am Night, and I saw your tears flow as you&#10;sang.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I will sing them all to you,&#34; said the mother; &#34;but do&#10;not detain me now. I must overtake him, and find my&#10;child.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But Night sat silent and still. Then the mother wept and&#10;sang, and wrung her hands. And there were many songs, and yet even&#10;more tears; till at length Night said, &#34;Go to the right, into the&#10;dark forest of fir-trees; for I saw Death take that road with your&#10;little child.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Within the wood the mother came to cross roads, and she&#10;knew not which to take. Just by stood a thorn-bush; it had neither&#10;leaf nor flower, for it was the cold winter time, and icicles hung&#10;on the branches. &#34;Have you not seen Death go by, with my little&#10;child?&#34; she asked.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes,&#34; replied the thorn-bush; &#34;but I will not tell you&#10;which way he has taken until you have warmed me in your bosom. I am&#10;freezing to death here, and turning to ice.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then she pressed the bramble to her bosom quite close, so&#10;that it might be thawed, and the thorns pierced her flesh, and&#10;great drops of blood flowed; but the bramble shot forth fresh green&#10;leaves, and they became flowers on the cold winter&#39;s night, so warm&#10;is the heart of a sorrowing mother. Then the bramble-bush told her&#10;the path she must take. She came at length to a great lake, on&#10;which there was neither ship nor boat to be seen. The lake was not&#10;frozen sufficiently for her to pass over on the ice, nor was it&#10;open enough for her to wade through; and yet she must cross it, if&#10;she wished to find her child. Then she laid herself down to drink&#10;up the water of the lake, which was of course impossible for any&#10;human being to do; but the bereaved mother thought that perhaps a&#10;miracle might take place to help her. &#34;You will never succeed in&#10;this,&#34; said the lake; let us make an agreement together which will&#10;be better. I love to collect pearls, and your eyes are the purest I&#10;have ever seen. If you will weep those eyes away in tears into my&#10;waters, then I will take you to the large hothouse where Death&#10;dwells and rears flowers and trees, every one of which is a human&#10;life.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, what would I not give to reach my child!&#34; said the&#10;weeping mother; and as she still continued to weep, her eyes fell&#10;into the depths of the lake, and became two costly&#10;pearls.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the lake lifted her up, and wafted her across to the&#10;opposite shore as if she were on a swing, where stood a wonderful&#10;building many miles in length. No one could tell whether it was a&#10;mountain covered with forests and full of caves, or whether it had&#10;been built. But the poor mother could not see, for she had wept her&#10;eyes into the lake. &#34;Where shall I find Death, who went away with&#10;my little child?&#34; she asked.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;He has not arrived here yet,&#34; said an old gray-haired&#10;woman, who was walking about, and watering Death&#39;s hothouse. &#34;How&#10;have you found your way here? and who helped you?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;God has helped me,&#34; she replied. &#34;He is merciful; will&#10;you not be merciful too? Where shall I find my little&#10;child?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I did not know the child,&#34; said the old woman; &#34;and you&#10;are blind. Many flowers and trees have faded to-night, and Death&#10;will soon come to transplant them. You know already that every&#10;human being has a life-tree or a life-flower, just as may be&#10;ordained for him. They look like other plants; but they have hearts&#10;that beat. Children&#39;s hearts also beat: from that you may perhaps&#10;be able to recognize your child. But what will you give me, if I&#10;tell you what more you will have to do?&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I have nothing to give,&#34; said the afflicted mother; &#34;but&#10;I would go to the ends of the earth for you.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I can give you nothing to do for me there,&#34; said the old&#10;woman; &#34;but you can give me your long black hair. You know yourself&#10;that it is beautiful, and it pleases me. You can take my white hair&#10;in exchange, which will be something in return.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Do you ask nothing more than that?&#34; said she. &#34;I will&#10;give it to you with pleasure.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And she gave up her beautiful hair, and received in return&#10;the white locks of the old woman. Then they went into Death&#39;s vast&#10;hothouse, where flowers and trees grew together in wonderful&#10;profusion. Blooming hyacinths, under glass bells, and peonies, like&#10;strong trees. There grew water-plants, some quite fresh, and others&#10;looking sickly, which had water-snakes twining round them, and&#10;black crabs clinging to their stems. There stood noble palm-trees,&#10;oaks, and plantains, and beneath them bloomed thyme and parsley.&#10;Each tree and flower had a name; each represented a human life, and&#10;belonged to men still living, some in China, others in Greenland,&#10;and in all parts of the world. Some large trees had been planted in&#10;little pots, so that they were cramped for room, and seemed about&#10;to burst the pot to pieces; while many weak little flowers were&#10;growing in rich soil, with moss all around them, carefully tended&#10;and cared for. The sorrowing mother bent over the little plants,&#10;and heard the human heart beating in each, and recognized the&#10;beatings of her child&#39;s heart among millions of others.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That is it,&#34; she cried, stretching out her hand towards a&#10;little crocus-flower which hung down its sickly head.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Do not touch the flower,&#34; exclaimed the old woman; &#34;but&#10;place yourself here; and when Death comes&#8212;I expect him every&#10;minute&#8212;do not let him pull up that plant, but threaten him that if&#10;he does you will serve the other flowers in the same manner. This&#10;will make him afraid; for he must account to God for each of them.&#10;None can be uprooted, unless he receives permission to do&#10;so.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;There rushed through the hothouse a chill of icy coldness,&#10;and the blind mother felt that Death had arrived.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;How did you find your way hither?&#34; asked he; &#34;how could&#10;you come here faster than I have?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I am a mother,&#34; she answered.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And Death stretched out his hand towards the delicate&#10;little flower; but she held her hands tightly round it, and held it&#10;fast at same time, with the most anxious care, lest she should&#10;touch one of the leaves. Then Death breathed upon her hands, and&#10;she felt his breath colder than the icy wind, and her hands sank&#10;down powerless.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You cannot prevail against me,&#34; said Death.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But a God of mercy can,&#34; said she.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I only do His will,&#34; replied Death. &#34;I am his gardener. I&#10;take all His flowers and trees, and transplant them into the&#10;gardens of Paradise in an unknown land. How they flourish there,&#10;and what that garden resembles, I may not tell you.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Give me back my child,&#34; said the mother, weeping and&#10;imploring; and she seized two beautiful flowers in her hands, and&#10;cried to Death, &#34;I will tear up all your flowers, for I am in&#10;despair.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Do not touch them,&#34; said Death. &#34;You say you are unhappy;&#10;and would you make another mother as unhappy as&#10;yourself?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Another mother!&#34; cried the poor woman, setting the&#10;flowers free from her hands.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;There are your eyes,&#34; said Death. &#34;I fished them up out&#10;of the lake for you. They were shining brightly; but I knew not&#10;they were yours. Take them back&#8212;they are clearer now than&#10;before&#8212;and then look into the deep well which is close by here. I&#10;will tell you the names of the two flowers which you wished to pull&#10;up; and you will see the whole future of the human beings they&#10;represent, and what you were about to frustrate and&#10;destroy.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then she looked into the well; and it was a glorious sight&#10;to behold how one of them became a blessing to the world, and how&#10;much happiness and joy it spread around. But she saw that the life&#10;of the other was full of care and poverty, misery and&#10;woe.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Both are the will of God,&#34; said Death.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Which is the unhappy flower, and which is the blessed&#10;one?&#34; she said.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That I may not tell you,&#34; said Death; &#34;but thus far you&#10;may learn, that one of the two flowers represents your own child.&#10;It was the fate of your child that you saw,&#8212;the future of your own&#10;child.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the mother screamed aloud with terror, &#34;Which of them&#10;belongs to my child? Tell me that. Deliver the unhappy child.&#10;Release it from so much misery. Rather take it away. Take it to the&#10;kingdom of God. Forget my tears and my entreaties; forget all that&#10;I have said or done.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I do not understand you,&#34; said Death. &#34;Will you have your&#10;child back? or shall I carry him away to a place that you do not&#10;know?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the mother wrung her hands, fell on her knees, and&#10;prayed to God, &#34;Grant not my prayers, when they are contrary to Thy&#10;will, which at all times must be the best. Oh, hear them not;&#34; and&#10;her head sank on her bosom.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then Death carried away her child to the unknown&#10;land.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Saucy Boy'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;ONCE upon a time there was an old poet, one of those right&#10;good old poets.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;One evening, as he was sitting at home, there was a&#10;terrible storm going on outside; the rain was pouring down, but the&#10;old poet sat comfortably in his chimney-corner, where the fire was&#10;burning and the apples were roasting.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;There will not be a dry thread left on the poor people&#10;who are out in this weather,&#34; he said.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, open the door! I am so cold and wet through,&#34; called&#10;a little child outside. It was crying and knocking at the door,&#10;whilst the rain was pouring down and the wind was rattling all the&#10;windows.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Poor creature!&#34; said the poet, and got up and opened the&#10;door. Before him stood a little boy; he was naked, and the water&#10;flowed from his long fair locks. He was shivering with cold; if he&#10;had not been let in, he would certainly have perished in the&#10;storm.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Poor little thing!&#34; said the poet, and took him by the&#10;hand. &#34;Come to me; I will soon warm you. You shall have some wine&#10;and an apple, for you are such a pretty boy.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And he was, too. His eyes sparkled like two bright stars,&#10;and although the water flowed down from his fair locks, they still&#10;curled quite beautifully.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;He looked like a little angel, but was pale with cold, and&#10;trembling all over. In his hand he held a splendid bow, but it had&#10;been entirely spoilt by the rain, and the colours of the pretty&#10;arrows had run into one another by getting wet.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The old man sat down by the fire, and taking the little&#10;boy on his knee, wrung the water out of his locks and warmed his&#10;hands in his own.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;He then made him some hot spiced wine, which quickly&#10;revived him; so that with reddening cheeks, he sprang upon the&#10;floor and danced around the old man.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You are a merry boy,&#34; said the latter. &#34;What is your&#10;name?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;My name is Cupid,&#34; he answered. &#34;Don&#39;t you know me? There&#10;lies my bow. I shoot with that, you know. Look, the weather is&#10;getting fine again&#8212;the moon is shining.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But your bow is spoilt,&#34; said the old poet.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That would be unfortunate,&#34; said the little boy, taking&#10;it up and looking at it. &#34;Oh, it&#39;s quite dry and isn&#39;t damaged at&#10;all. The string is quite tight; I&#39;ll try it.&#34; So, drawing it back,&#10;he took an arrow, aimed, and shot the good old poet right in the&#10;heart. &#34;Do you see now that my bow was not spoilt?&#34; he said, and,&#10;loudly laughing, ran away. What a naughty boy to shoot the old poet&#10;like that, who had taken him into his warm room, had been so good&#10;to him, and had given him the nicest wine and the best&#10;apple!&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The good old man lay upon the floor crying; he was really&#10;shot in the heart. &#34;Oh!&#34; he cried, &#34;what a naughty boy this Cupid&#10;is! I shall tell all the good children about this, so that they&#10;take care never to play with him, lest he hurt them.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And all good children, both girls and boys, whom he told&#10;about this, were on their guard against wicked Cupid; but he&#10;deceives them all the same, for he is very deep. When the students&#10;come out of class, he walks beside them with a book under his arm,&#10;and wearing a black coat. They cannot recognize him. And then, if&#10;they take him by the arm, believing him to be a student too, he&#10;sticks an arrow into their chest. And when the girls go to church&#10;to be confirmed, he is amongst them too. In fact, he is always&#10;after people. He sits in the large chandelier in the theatre and&#10;blazes away, so that people think it is a lamp; but they soon find&#10;out their mistake. He walks about in the castle garden and on the&#10;promenades. Yes, once he shot your father and your mother in the&#10;heart too. Just ask them, and you will hear what they say. Oh! he&#10;is a bad boy, this Cupid, and you must never have anything to do&#10;with him, for he is after every one. Just think, he even shot an&#10;arrow at old grandmother; but that was a long time ago. The wound&#10;has long been healed, but such things are never&#10;forgotten.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Now you know what a bad boy this wicked Cupid&#10;is.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Shadow'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;IN very hot climates, where the heat of the sun has great&#10;power, people are usually as brown as mahogany; and in the hottest&#10;countries they are negroes, with black skins. A learned man once&#10;travelled into one of these warm climates, from the cold regions of&#10;the north, and thought he would roam about as he did at home; but&#10;he soon had to change his opinion. He found that, like all sensible&#10;people, he must remain in the house during the whole day, with&#10;every window and door closed, so that it looked as if all in the&#10;house were asleep or absent. The houses of the narrow street in&#10;which he lived were so lofty that the sun shone upon them from&#10;morning till evening, and it became quite unbearable. This learned&#10;man from the cold regions was young as well as clever; but it&#10;seemed to him as if he were sitting in an oven, and he became quite&#10;exhausted and weak, and grew so thin that his shadow shrivelled up,&#10;and became much smaller than it had been at home. The sun took away&#10;even what was left of it, and he saw nothing of it till the&#10;evening, after sunset. It was really a pleasure, as soon as the&#10;lights were brought into the room, to see the shadow stretch itself&#10;against the wall, even to the ceiling, so tall was it; and it&#10;really wanted a good stretch to recover its strength. The learned&#10;man would sometimes go out into the balcony to stretch himself&#10;also; and as soon as the stars came forth in the clear, beautiful&#10;sky, he felt revived. People at this hour began to make their&#10;appearance in all the balconies in the street; for in warm climates&#10;every window has a balcony, in which they can breathe the fresh&#10;evening air, which is very necessary, even to those who are used to&#10;a heat that makes them as brown as mahogany; so that the street&#10;presented a very lively appearance. Here were shoemakers, and&#10;tailors, and all sorts of people sitting. In the street beneath,&#10;they brought out tables and chairs, lighted candles by hundreds,&#10;talked and sang, and were very merry. There were people walking,&#10;carriages driving, and mules trotting along, with their bells on&#10;the harness, &#34;tingle, tingle,&#34; as they went. Then the dead were&#10;carried to the grave with the sound of solemn music, and the&#10;tolling of the church bells. It was indeed a scene of varied life&#10;in the street. One house only, which was just opposite to the one&#10;in which the foreign learned man lived, formed a contrast to all&#10;this, for it was quite still; and yet somebody dwelt there, for&#10;flowers stood in the balcony, blooming beautifully in the hot sun;&#10;and this could not have been unless they had been watered&#10;carefully. Therefore some one must be in the house to do this. The&#10;doors leading to the balcony were half opened in the evening; and&#10;although in the front room all was dark, music could be heard from&#10;the interior of the house. The foreign learned man considered this&#10;music very delightful; but perhaps he fancied it; for everything in&#10;these warm countries pleased him, excepting the heat of the sun.&#10;The foreign landlord said he did not know who had taken the&#10;opposite house&#8212;nobody was to be seen there; and as to the music, he&#10;thought it seemed very tedious, to him most uncommonly&#10;so.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It is just as if some one was practising a piece that he&#10;could not manage; it is always the same piece. He thinks, I&#10;suppose, that he will be able to manage it at last; but I do not&#10;think so, however long he may play it.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Once the foreigner woke in the night. He slept with the&#10;door open which led to the balcony; the wind had raised the curtain&#10;before it, and there appeared a wonderful brightness over all in&#10;the balcony of the opposite house. The flowers seemed like flames&#10;of the most gorgeous colors, and among the flowers stood a&#10;beautiful slender maiden. It was to him as if light streamed from&#10;her, and dazzled his eyes; but then he had only just opened them,&#10;as he awoke from his sleep. With one spring he was out of bed, and&#10;crept softly behind the curtain. But she was gone&#8212;the brightness&#10;had disappeared; the flowers no longer appeared like flames,&#10;although still as beautiful as ever. The door stood ajar, and from&#10;an inner room sounded music so sweet and so lovely, that it&#10;produced the most enchanting thoughts, and acted on the senses with&#10;magic power. Who could live there? Where was the real entrance?&#10;for, both in the street and in the lane at the side, the whole&#10;ground floor was a continuation of shops; and people could not&#10;always be passing through them.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;One evening the foreigner sat in the balcony. A light was&#10;burning in his own room, just behind him. It was quite natural,&#10;therefore, that his shadow should fall on the wall of the opposite&#10;house; so that, as he sat amongst the flowers on his balcony, when&#10;he moved, his shadow moved also.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I think my shadow is the only living thing to be seen&#10;opposite,&#34; said the learned man; &#34;see how pleasantly it sits among&#10;the flowers. The door is only ajar; the shadow ought to be clever&#10;enough to step in and look about him, and then to come back and&#10;tell me what he has seen. You could make yourself useful in this&#10;way,&#34; said he, jokingly; &#34;be so good as to step in now, will you?&#34;&#10;and then he nodded to the shadow, and the shadow nodded in return.&#10;&#34;Now go, but don&#39;t stay away altogether.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the foreigner stood up, and the shadow on the&#10;opposite balcony stood up also; the foreigner turned round, the&#10;shadow turned; and if any one had observed, they might have seen it&#10;go straight into the half-opened door of the opposite balcony, as&#10;the learned man re-entered his own room, and let the curtain fall.&#10;The next morning he went out to take his coffee and read the&#10;newspapers.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;How is this?&#34; he exclaimed, as he stood in the sunshine.&#10;&#34;I have lost my shadow. So it really did go away yesterday evening,&#10;and it has not returned. This is very annoying.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And it certainly did vex him, not so much because the&#10;shadow was gone, but because he knew there was a story of a man&#10;without a shadow. All the people at home, in his country, knew this&#10;story; and when he returned, and related his own adventures, they&#10;would say it was only an imitation; and he had no desire for such&#10;things to be said of him. So he decided not to speak of it at all,&#10;which was a very sensible determination.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the evening he went out again on his balcony, taking&#10;care to place the light behind him; for he knew that a shadow&#10;always wants his master for a screen; but he could not entice him&#10;out. He made himself little, and he made himself tall; but there&#10;was no shadow, and no shadow came. He said, &#34;Hem, a-hem;&#34; but it&#10;was all useless. That was very vexatious; but in warm countries&#10;everything grows very quickly; and, after a week had passed, he&#10;saw, to his great joy, that a new shadow was growing from his feet,&#10;when he walked in the sunshine; so that the root must have&#10;remained. After three weeks, he had quite a respectable shadow,&#10;which, during his return journey to northern lands, continued to&#10;grow, and became at last so large that he might very well have&#10;spared half of it. When this learned man arrived at home, he wrote&#10;books about the true, the good, and the beautiful, which are to be&#10;found in this world; and so days and years passed&#8212;many, many&#10;years.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;One evening, as he sat in his study, a very gentle tap was&#10;heard at the door. &#34;Come in,&#34; said he; but no one came. He opened&#10;the door, and there stood before him a man so remarkably thin that&#10;he felt seriously troubled at his appearance. He was, however, very&#10;well dressed, and looked like a gentleman. &#34;To whom have I the&#10;honor of speaking?&#34; said he.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ah, I hoped you would recognize me,&#34; said the elegant&#10;stranger; &#34;I have gained so much that I have a body of flesh, and&#10;clothes to wear. You never expected to see me in such a condition.&#10;Do you not recognize your old shadow? Ah, you never expected that I&#10;should return to you again. All has been prosperous with me since I&#10;was with you last; I have become rich in every way, and, were I&#10;inclined to purchase my freedom from service, I could easily do&#10;so.&#34; And as he spoke he rattled between his fingers a number of&#10;costly trinkets which hung to a thick gold watch-chain he wore&#10;round his neck. Diamond rings sparkled on his fingers, and it was&#10;all real.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I cannot recover from my astonishment,&#34; said the learned&#10;man. &#34;What does all this mean?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Something rather unusual,&#34; said the shadow; &#34;but you are&#10;yourself an uncommon man, and you know very well that I have&#10;followed in your footsteps ever since your childhood. As soon as&#10;you found that I have travelled enough to be trusted alone, I went&#10;my own way, and I am now in the most brilliant circumstances. But I&#10;felt a kind of longing to see you once more before you die, and I&#10;wanted to see this place again, for there is always a clinging to&#10;the land of one&#39;s birth. I know that you have now another shadow;&#10;do I owe you anything? If so, have the goodness to say what it&#10;is.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No! Is it really you?&#34; said the learned man. &#34;Well, this&#10;is most remarkable; I never supposed it possible that a man&#39;s old&#10;shadow could become a human being.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Just tell me what I owe you,&#34; said the shadow, &#34;for I do&#10;not like to be in debt to any man.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;How can you talk in that manner?&#34; said the learned man.&#10;&#34;What question of debt can there be between us? You are as free as&#10;any one. I rejoice exceedingly to hear of your good fortune. Sit&#10;down, old friend, and tell me a little of how it happened, and what&#10;you saw in the house opposite to me while we were in those hot&#10;climates.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, I will tell you all about it,&#34; said the shadow,&#10;sitting down; &#34;but then you must promise me never to tell in this&#10;city, wherever you may meet me, that I have been your shadow. I am&#10;thinking of being married, for I have more than sufficient to&#10;support a family.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Make yourself quite easy,&#34; said the learned man; &#34;I will&#10;tell no one who you really are. Here is my hand,&#8212;I promise, and a&#10;word is sufficient between man and man.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Between man and a shadow,&#34; said the shadow; for he could&#10;not help saying so.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was really most remarkable how very much he had become&#10;a man in appearance. He was dressed in a suit of the very finest&#10;black cloth, polished boots, and an opera crush hat, which could be&#10;folded together so that nothing could be seen but the crown and the&#10;rim, besides the trinkets, the gold chain, and the diamond rings&#10;already spoken of. The shadow was, in fact, very well dressed, and&#10;this made a man of him. &#34;Now I will relate to you what you wish to&#10;know,&#34; said the shadow, placing his foot with the polished leather&#10;boot as firmly as possible on the arm of the new shadow of the&#10;learned man, which lay at his feet like a poodle dog. This was&#10;done, it might be from pride, or perhaps that the new shadow might&#10;cling to him, but the prostrate shadow remained quite quiet and at&#10;rest, in order that it might listen, for it wanted to know how a&#10;shadow could be sent away by its master, and become a man itself.&#10;&#34;Do you know,&#34; said the shadow, &#34;that in the house opposite to you&#10;lived the most glorious creature in the world? It was poetry. I&#10;remained there three weeks, and it was more like three thousand&#10;years, for I read all that has ever been written in poetry or&#10;prose; and I may say, in truth, that I saw and learnt&#10;everything.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Poetry!&#34; exclaimed the learned man. &#34;Yes, she lives as a&#10;hermit in great cities. Poetry! Well, I saw her once for a very&#10;short moment, while sleep weighed down my eyelids. She flashed upon&#10;me from the balcony like the radiant aurora borealis, surrounded&#10;with flowers like flames of fire. Tell me, you were on the balcony&#10;that evening; you went through the door, and what did you&#10;see?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I found myself in an ante-room,&#34; said the shadow. &#34;You&#10;still sat opposite to me, looking into the room. There was no&#10;light, or at least it seemed in partial darkness, for the door of a&#10;whole suite of rooms stood open, and they were brilliantly lighted.&#10;The blaze of light would have killed me, had I approached too near&#10;the maiden myself, but I was cautious, and took time, which is what&#10;every one ought to do.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And what didst thou see?&#34; asked the learned&#10;man.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I saw everything, as you shall hear. But&#8212;it really is not&#10;pride on my part, as a free man and possessing the knowledge that I&#10;do, besides my position, not to speak of my wealth&#8212;I wish you would&#10;say you to me instead of thou.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I beg your pardon,&#34; said the learned man; &#34;it is an old&#10;habit, which it is difficult to break. You are quite right; I will&#10;try to think of it. But now tell me everything that you&#10;saw.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Everything,&#34; said the shadow; &#34;for I saw and know&#10;everything.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What was the appearance of the inner rooms?&#34; asked the&#10;scholar. &#34;Was it there like a cool grove, or like a holy temple?&#10;Were the chambers like a starry sky seen from the top of a high&#10;mountain?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It was all that you describe,&#34; said the shadow; &#34;but I&#10;did not go quite in&#8212;I remained in the twilight of the ante-room&#8212;but&#10;I was in a very good position,&#8212;I could see and hear all that was&#10;going on in the court of poetry.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But what did you see? Did the gods of ancient times pass&#10;through the rooms? Did old heroes fight their battles over again?&#10;Were there lovely children at play, who related their&#10;dreams?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I tell you I have been there, and therefore you may be&#10;sure that I saw everything that was to be seen. If you had gone&#10;there, you would not have remained a human being, whereas I became&#10;one; and at the same moment I became aware of my inner being, my&#10;inborn affinity to the nature of poetry. It is true I did not think&#10;much about it while I was with you, but you will remember that I&#10;was always much larger at sunrise and sunset, and in the moonlight&#10;even more visible than yourself, but I did not then understand my&#10;inner existence. In the ante-room it was revealed to me. I became a&#10;man; I came out in full maturity. But you had left the warm&#10;countries. As a man, I felt ashamed to go about without boots or&#10;clothes, and that exterior finish by which man is known. So I went&#10;my own way; I can tell you, for you will not put it in a book. I&#10;hid myself under the cloak of a cake woman, but she little thought&#10;who she concealed. It was not till evening that I ventured out. I&#10;ran about the streets in the moonlight. I drew myself up to my full&#10;height upon the walls, which tickled my back very pleasantly. I ran&#10;here and there, looked through the highest windows into the rooms,&#10;and over the roofs. I looked in, and saw what nobody else could&#10;see, or indeed ought to see; in fact, it is a bad world, and I&#10;would not care to be a man, but that men are of some importance. I&#10;saw the most miserable things going on between husbands and wives,&#10;parents and children,&#8212;sweet, incomparable children. I have seen&#10;what no human being has the power of knowing, although they would&#10;all be very glad to know&#8212;the evil conduct of their neighbors. Had I&#10;written a newspaper, how eagerly it would have been read! Instead&#10;of which, I wrote directly to the persons themselves, and great&#10;alarm arose in all the town I visited. They had so much fear of me,&#10;and yet how dearly they loved me. The professor made me a&#10;professor. The tailor gave me new clothes; I am well provided for&#10;in that way. The overseer of the mint struck coins for me. The&#10;women declared that I was handsome, and so I became the man you now&#10;see me. And now I must say adieu. Here is my card. I live on the&#10;sunny side of the street, and always stay at home in rainy&#10;weather.&#34; And the shadow departed.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;This is all very remarkable,&#34; said the learned&#10;man.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Years passed, days and years went by, and the shadow came&#10;again. &#34;How are you going on now?&#34; he asked.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ah!&#34; said the learned man; &#34;I am writing about the true,&#10;the beautiful, and the good; but no one cares to hear anything&#10;about it. I am quite in despair, for I take it to heart very&#10;much.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That is what I never do,&#34; said the shadow; &#34;I am growing&#10;quite fat and stout, which every one ought to be. You do not&#10;understand the world; you will make yourself ill about it; you&#10;ought to travel; I am going on a journey in the summer, will you go&#10;with me? I should like a travelling companion; will you travel with&#10;me as my shadow? It would give me great pleasure, and I will pay&#10;all expenses.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Are you going to travel far?&#34; asked the learned&#10;man.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That is a matter of opinion,&#34; replied the shadow. &#34;At all&#10;events, a journey will do you good, and if you will be my shadow,&#10;then all your journey shall be paid.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It appears to me very absurd,&#34; said the learned&#10;man.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But it is the way of the world,&#34; replied the shadow, &#34;and&#10;always will be.&#34; Then he went away.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Everything went wrong with the learned man. Sorrow and&#10;trouble pursued him, and what he said about the good, the&#10;beautiful, and the true, was of as much value to most people as a&#10;nutmeg would be to a cow. At length he fell ill. &#34;You really look&#10;like a shadow,&#34; people said to him, and then a cold shudder would&#10;pass over him, for he had his own thoughts on the&#10;subject.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You really ought to go to some watering-place,&#34; said the&#10;shadow on his next visit. &#34;There is no other chance for you. I will&#10;take you with me, for the sake of old acquaintance. I will pay the&#10;expenses of your journey, and you shall write a description of it&#10;to amuse us by the way. I should like to go to a watering-place; my&#10;beard does not grow as it ought, which is from weakness, and I must&#10;have a beard. Now do be sensible and accept my proposal; we shall&#10;travel as intimate friends.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And at last they started together. The shadow was master&#10;now, and the master became the shadow. They drove together, and&#10;rode and walked in company with each other, side by side, or one in&#10;front and the other behind, according to the position of the sun.&#10;The shadow always knew when to take the place of honor, but the&#10;learned man took no notice of it, for he had a good heart, and was&#10;exceedingly mild and friendly.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;One day the master said to the shadow, &#34;We have grown up&#10;together from our childhood, and now that we have become travelling&#10;companions, shall we not drink to our good fellowship, and say thee&#10;and thou to each other?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What you say is very straightforward and kindly meant,&#34;&#10;said the shadow, who was now really master. &#34;I will be equally kind&#10;and straightforward. You are a learned man, and know how wonderful&#10;human nature is. There are some men who cannot endure the smell of&#10;brown paper; it makes them ill. Others will feel a shuddering&#10;sensation to their very marrow, if a nail is scratched on a pane of&#10;glass. I myself have a similar kind of feeling when I hear any one&#10;say thou to me. I feel crushed by it, as I used to feel in my&#10;former position with you. You will perceive that this is a matter&#10;of feeling, not pride. I cannot allow you to say thou to me; I will&#10;gladly say it to you, and therefore your wish will be half&#10;fulfilled.&#34; Then the shadow addressed his former master as&#10;thou.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It is going rather too far,&#34; said the latter, &#34;that I am&#10;to say you when I speak to him, and he is to say thou to me.&#34;&#10;However, he was obliged to submit.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;They arrived at length at the baths, where there were many&#10;strangers, and among them a beautiful princess, whose real disease&#10;consisted in being too sharp-sighted, which made every one very&#10;uneasy. She saw at once that the new comer was very different to&#10;every one else. &#34;They say he is here to make his beard grow,&#34; she&#10;thought; &#34;but I know the real cause, he is unable to cast a&#10;shadow.&#34; Then she became very curious on the matter, and one day,&#10;while on the promenade, she entered into conversation with the&#10;strange gentleman. Being a princess, she was not obliged to stand&#10;upon much ceremony, so she said to him without hesitation, &#34;Your&#10;illness consists in not being able to cast a shadow.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Your royal highness must be on the high road to recovery&#10;from your illness,&#34; said he. &#34;I know your complaint arose from&#10;being too sharp-sighted, and in this case it has entirely failed. I&#10;happen to have a most unusual shadow. Have you not seen a person&#10;who is always at my side? Persons often give their servants finer&#10;cloth for their liveries than for their own clothes, and so I have&#10;dressed out my shadow like a man; nay, you may observe that I have&#10;even given him a shadow of his own; it is rather expensive, but I&#10;like to have things about me that are peculiar.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;How is this?&#34; thought the princess; &#34;am I really cured?&#10;This must be the best watering-place in existence. Water in our&#10;times has certainly wonderful power. But I will not leave this&#10;place yet, just as it begins to be amusing. This foreign prince&#8212;for&#10;he must be a prince&#8212;pleases me above all things. I only hope his&#10;beard won&#39;t grow, or he will leave at once.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the evening, the princess and the shadow danced&#10;together in the large assembly rooms. She was light, but he was&#10;lighter still; she had never seen such a dancer before. She told&#10;him from what country she had come, and found he knew it and had&#10;been there, but not while she was at home. He had looked into the&#10;windows of her father&#39;s palace, both the upper and the lower&#10;windows; he had seen many things, and could therefore answer the&#10;princess, and make allusions which quite astonished her. She&#10;thought he must be the cleverest man in all the world, and felt the&#10;greatest respect for his knowledge. When she danced with him again&#10;she fell in love with him, which the shadow quickly discovered, for&#10;she had with her eyes looked him through and through. They danced&#10;once more, and she was nearly telling him, but she had some&#10;discretion; she thought of her country, her kingdom, and the number&#10;of people over whom she would one day have to rule. &#34;He is a clever&#10;man,&#34; she thought to herself, &#34;which is a good thing, and he dances&#10;admirably, which is also good. But has he well-grounded knowledge?&#10;that is an important question, and I must try him.&#34; Then she asked&#10;him a most difficult question, she herself could not have answered&#10;it, and the shadow made a most unaccountable grimace.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You cannot answer that,&#34; said the princess.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I learnt something about it in my childhood,&#34; he replied;&#10;&#34;and believe that even my very shadow, standing over there by the&#10;door, could answer it.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Your shadow,&#34; said the princess; &#34;indeed that would be&#10;very remarkable.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I do not say so positively,&#34; observed the shadow; &#34;but I&#10;am inclined to believe that he can do so. He has followed me for so&#10;many years, and has heard so much from me, that I think it is very&#10;likely. But your royal highness must allow me to observe, that he&#10;is very proud of being considered a man, and to put him in a good&#10;humor, so that he may answer correctly, he must be treated as a&#10;man.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I shall be very pleased to do so,&#34; said the princess. So&#10;she walked up to the learned man, who stood in the doorway, and&#10;spoke to him of the sun, and the moon, of the green forests, and of&#10;people near home and far off; and the learned man conversed with&#10;her pleasantly and sensibly.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What a wonderful man he must be, to have such a clever&#10;shadow!&#34; thought she. &#34;If I were to choose him it would be a real&#10;blessing to my country and my subjects, and I will do it.&#34; So the&#10;princess and the shadow were soon engaged to each other, but no one&#10;was to be told a word about it, till she returned to her&#10;kingdom.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No one shall know,&#34; said the shadow; &#34;not even my own&#10;shadow;&#34; and he had very particular reasons for saying&#10;so.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;After a time, the princess returned to the land over which&#10;she reigned, and the shadow accompanied her.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Listen my friend,&#34; said the shadow to the learned man;&#10;&#34;now that I am as fortunate and as powerful as any man can be, I&#10;will do something unusually good for you. You shall live in my&#10;palace, drive with me in the royal carriage, and have a hundred&#10;thousand dollars a year; but you must allow every one to call you a&#10;shadow, and never venture to say that you have been a man. And once&#10;a year, when I sit in my balcony in the sunshine, you must lie at&#10;my feet as becomes a shadow to do; for I must tell you I am going&#10;to marry the princess, and our wedding will take place this&#10;evening.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Now, really, this is too ridiculous,&#34; said the learned&#10;man. &#34;I cannot, and will not, submit to such folly. It would be&#10;cheating the whole country, and the princess also. I will disclose&#10;everything, and say that I am the man, and that you are only a&#10;shadow dressed up in men&#39;s clothes.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No one would believe you,&#34; said the shadow; &#34;be&#10;reasonable, now, or I will call the guards.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I will go straight to the princess,&#34; said the learned&#10;man.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But I shall be there first,&#34; replied the shadow, &#34;and you&#10;will be sent to prison.&#34; And so it turned out, for the guards&#10;readily obeyed him, as they knew he was going to marry the king&#39;s&#10;daughter.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You tremble,&#34; said the princess, when the shadow appeared&#10;before her. &#34;Has anything happened? You must not be ill to-day, for&#10;this evening our wedding will take place.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I have gone through the most terrible affair that could&#10;possibly happen,&#34; said the shadow; &#34;only imagine, my shadow has&#10;gone mad; I suppose such a poor, shallow brain, could not bear&#10;much; he fancies that he has become a real man, and that I am his&#10;shadow.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;How very terrible,&#34; cried the princess; &#34;is he locked&#10;up?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh yes, certainly; for I fear he will never&#10;recover.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Poor shadow!&#34; said the princess; &#34;it is very unfortunate&#10;for him; it would really be a good deed to free him from his frail&#10;existence; and, indeed, when I think how often people take the part&#10;of the lower class against the higher, in these days, it would be&#10;policy to put him out of the way quietly.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It is certainly rather hard upon him, for he was a&#10;faithful servant,&#34; said the shadow; and he pretended to&#10;sigh.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yours is a noble character,&#34; said the princess, and bowed&#10;herself before him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the evening the whole town was illuminated, and cannons&#10;fired &#34;boom,&#34; and the soldiers presented arms. It was indeed a&#10;grand wedding. The princess and the shadow stepped out on the&#10;balcony to show themselves, and to receive one cheer more. But the&#10;learned man heard nothing of all these festivities, for he had&#10;already been executed.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Shepherdess and the Sheep'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;HAVE you ever seen an old wooden cupboard quite black with&#10;age, and ornamented with carved foliage and curious figures? Well,&#10;just such a cupboard stood in a parlor, and had been left to the&#10;family as a legacy by the great-grandmother. It was covered from&#10;top to bottom with carved roses and tulips; the most curious&#10;scrolls were drawn upon it, and out of them peeped little stags&#39;&#10;heads, with antlers. In the middle of the cupboard door was the&#10;carved figure of a man most ridiculous to look at. He grinned at&#10;you, for no one could call it laughing. He had goat&#39;s legs, little&#10;horns on his head, and a long beard; the children in the room&#10;always called him, &#34;Major general-field-sergeant-commander&#10;Billy-goat&#39;s-legs.&#34; It was certainly a very difficult name to&#10;pronounce, and there are very few who ever receive such a title,&#10;but then it seemed wonderful how he came to be carved at all; yet&#10;there he was, always looking at the table under the looking-glass,&#10;where stood a very pretty little shepherdess made of china. Her&#10;shoes were gilt, and her dress had a red rose or an ornament. She&#10;wore a hat, and carried a crook, that were both gilded, and looked&#10;very bright and pretty. Close by her side stood a little&#10;chimney-sweep, as black as coal, and also made of china. He was,&#10;however, quite as clean and neat as any other china figure; he only&#10;represented a black chimney-sweep, and the china workers might just&#10;as well have made him a prince, had they felt inclined to do so. He&#10;stood holding his ladder quite handily, and his face was as fair&#10;and rosy as a girl&#39;s; indeed, that was rather a mistake, it should&#10;have had some black marks on it. He and the shepherdess had been&#10;placed close together, side by side; and, being so placed, they&#10;became engaged to each other, for they were very well suited, being&#10;both made of the same sort of china, and being equally fragile.&#10;Close to them stood another figure, three times as large as they&#10;were, and also made of china. He was an old Chinaman, who could nod&#10;his head, and used to pretend that he was the grandfather of the&#10;shepherdess, although he could not prove it. He however assumed&#10;authority over her, and therefore when&#10;&#34;Major-general-field-sergeant-commander Billy-goat&#39;s-legs&#34; asked&#10;for the little shepherdess to be his wife, he nodded his head to&#10;show that he consented. &#34;You will have a husband,&#34; said the old&#10;Chinaman to her, &#34;who I really believe is made of mahogany. He will&#10;make you a lady of Major-general-field-sergeant-commander&#10;Billy-goat&#39;s-legs. He has the whole cupboard full of silver plate,&#10;which he keeps locked up in secret drawers.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I won&#39;t go into the dark cupboard,&#34; said the little&#10;shepherdess. &#34;I have heard that he has eleven china wives there&#10;already.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Then you shall be the twelfth,&#34; said the old Chinaman.&#10;&#34;To-night as soon as you hear a rattling in the old cupboard, you&#10;shall be married, as true as I am a Chinaman;&#34; and then he nodded&#10;his head and fell asleep.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the little shepherdess cried, and looked at her&#10;sweetheart, the china chimney-sweep. &#34;I must entreat you,&#34; said&#10;she, &#34;to go out with me into the wide world, for we cannot stay&#10;here.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I will do whatever you wish,&#34; said the little&#10;chimney-sweep; &#34;let us go immediately: I think I shall be able to&#10;maintain you with my profession.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;If we were but safely down from the table!&#34; said she; &#34;I&#10;shall not be happy till we are really out in the world.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then he comforted her, and showed her how to place her&#10;little foot on the carved edge and gilt-leaf ornaments of the&#10;table. He brought his little ladder to help her, and so they&#10;contrived to reach the floor. But when they looked at the old&#10;cupboard, they saw it was all in an uproar. The carved stags pushed&#10;out their heads, raised their antlers, and twisted their necks. The&#10;major-general sprung up in the air; and cried out to the old&#10;Chinaman, &#34;They are running away! they are running away!&#34; The two&#10;were rather frightened at this, so they jumped into the drawer of&#10;the window-seat. Here were three or four packs of cards not quite&#10;complete, and a doll&#39;s theatre, which had been built up very&#10;neatly. A comedy was being performed in it, and all the queens of&#10;diamonds, clubs, and hearts,, and spades, sat in the first row&#10;fanning themselves with tulips, and behind them stood all the&#10;knaves, showing that they had heads above and below as playing&#10;cards generally have. The play was about two lovers, who were not&#10;allowed to marry, and the shepherdess wept because it was so like&#10;her own story. &#34;I cannot bear it,&#34; said she, &#34;I must get out of the&#10;drawer;&#34; but when they reached the floor, and cast their eyes on&#10;the table, there was the old Chinaman awake and shaking his whole&#10;body, till all at once down he came on the floor, &#34;plump.&#34; &#34;The old&#10;Chinaman is coming,&#34; cried the little shepherdess in a fright, and&#10;down she fell on one knee.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I have thought of something,&#34; said the chimney-sweep;&#10;&#34;let us get into the great pot-pourri jar which stands in the&#10;corner; there we can lie on rose-leaves and lavender, and throw&#10;salt in his eyes if he comes near us.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No, that will never do,&#34; said she, &#34;because I know that&#10;the Chinaman and the pot-pourri jar were lovers once, and there&#10;always remains behind a feeling of good-will between those who have&#10;been so intimate as that. No, there is nothing left for us but to&#10;go out into the wide world.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Have you really courage enough to go out into the wide&#10;world with me?&#34; said the chimney-sweep; &#34;have you thought how large&#10;it is, and that we can never come back here again?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, I have,&#34; she replied.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;When the chimney-sweep saw that she was quite firm, he&#10;said, &#34;My way is through the stove and up the chimney. Have you&#10;courage to creep with me through the fire-box, and the iron pipe?&#10;When we get to the chimney I shall know how to manage very well. We&#10;shall soon climb too high for any one to reach us, and we shall&#10;come through a hole in the top out into the wide world.&#34; So he led&#10;her to the door of the stove.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It looks very dark,&#34; said she; still she went in with him&#10;through the stove and through the pipe, where it was as dark as&#10;pitch.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Now we are in the chimney,&#34; said he; &#34;and look, there is&#10;a beautiful star shining above it.&#34; It was a real star shining down&#10;upon them as if it would show them the way. So they clambered, and&#10;crept on, and a frightful steep place it was; but the chimney-sweep&#10;helped her and supported her, till they got higher and higher. He&#10;showed her the best places on which to set her little china foot,&#10;so at last they reached the top of the chimney, and sat themselves&#10;down, for they were very tired, as may be supposed. The sky, with&#10;all its stars, was over their heads, and below were the roofs of&#10;the town. They could see for a very long distance out into the wide&#10;world, and the poor little shepherdess leaned her head on her&#10;chimney-sweep&#39;s shoulder, and wept till she washed the gilt off her&#10;sash; the world was so different to what she expected. &#34;This is too&#10;much,&#34; she said; &#34;I cannot bear it, the world is too large. Oh, I&#10;wish I were safe back on the table. again, under the looking glass;&#10;I shall never be happy till I am safe back again. Now I have&#10;followed you out into the wide world, you will take me back, if you&#10;love me.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the chimney-sweep tried to reason with her, and spoke&#10;of the old Chinaman, and of the&#10;Major-general-field-sergeant-commander Billy-goat&#39;s legs; but she&#10;sobbed so bitterly, and kissed her little chimney-sweep till he was&#10;obliged to do all she asked, foolish as it was. And so, with a&#10;great deal of trouble, they climbed down the chimney, and then&#10;crept through the pipe and stove, which were certainly not very&#10;pleasant places. Then they stood in the dark fire-box, and listened&#10;behind the door, to hear what was going on in the room. As it was&#10;all quiet, they peeped out. Alas! there lay the old Chinaman on the&#10;floor; he had fallen down from the table as he attempted to run&#10;after them, and was broken into three pieces; his back had&#10;separated entirely, and his head had rolled into a corner of the&#10;room. The major-general stood in his old place, and appeared lost&#10;in thought.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;This is terrible,&#34; said the little shepherdess. &#34;My poor&#10;old grandfather is broken to pieces, and it is our fault. I shall&#10;never live after this;&#34; and she wrung her little hands.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;He can be riveted,&#34; said the chimney-sweep; &#34;he can be&#10;riveted. Do not be so hasty. If they cement his back, and put a&#10;good rivet in it, he will be as good as new, and be able to say as&#10;many disagreeable things to us as ever.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Do you think so?&#34; said she; and then they climbed up to&#10;the table, and stood in their old places.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;As we have done no good,&#34; said the chimney-sweep, &#34;we&#10;might as well have remained here, instead of taking so much&#10;trouble.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I wish grandfather was riveted,&#34; said the shepherdess.&#10;&#34;Will it cost much, I wonder?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And she had her wish. The family had the Chinaman&#39;s back&#10;mended, and a strong rivet put through his neck; he looked as good&#10;as new, but he could no longer nod his head.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You have become proud since your fall broke you to&#10;pieces,&#34; said Major-general-field-sergeant-commander&#10;Billy-goat&#39;s-legs. &#34;You have no reason to give yourself such airs.&#10;Am I to have her or not?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The chimney-sweep and the little shepherdess looked&#10;piteously at the old Chinaman, for they were afraid he might nod;&#10;but he was not able: besides, it was so tiresome to be always&#10;telling strangers he had a rivet in the back of his&#10;neck.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And so the little china people remained together, and were&#10;glad of the grandfather&#39;s rivet, and continued to love each other&#10;till they were broken to pieces.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Silver Shilling'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;THERE was once a shilling, which came forth from the mint&#10;springing and shouting, &#34;Hurrah! now I am going out into the wide&#10;world.&#34; And truly it did go out into the wide world. The children&#10;held it with warm hands, the miser with a cold and convulsive&#10;grasp, and the old people turned it about, goodness knows how many&#10;times, while the young people soon allowed it to roll away from&#10;them. The shilling was made of silver, it contained very little&#10;copper, and considered itself quite out in the world when it had&#10;been circulated for a year in the country in which it had been&#10;coined. One day, it really did go out into the world, for it&#10;belonged to a gentleman who was about to travel in foreign lands.&#10;This gentleman was not aware that the shilling lay at the bottom of&#10;his purse when he started, till he one day found it between his&#10;fingers. &#34;Why,&#34; cried he, &#34;here is a shilling from home; well, it&#10;must go on its travels with me now!&#34; and the shilling jumped and&#10;rattled for joy, when it was put back again into the&#10;purse.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Here it lay among a number of foreign companions, who were&#10;always coming and going, one taking the place of another, but the&#10;shilling from home was always put back, and had to remain in the&#10;purse, which was certainly a mark of distinction. Many weeks&#10;passed, during which the shilling had travelled a long distance in&#10;the purse, without in the least knowing where he was. He had found&#10;out that the other coins were French and Italian; and one coin said&#10;they were in this town, and another said they were in that, but the&#10;shilling was unable to make out or imagine what they meant. A man&#10;certainly cannot see much of the world if he is tied up in a bag,&#10;and this was really the shilling&#39;s fate. But one day, as he was&#10;lying in the purse, he noticed that it was not quite closed, and so&#10;he slipped near to the opening to have a little peep into society.&#10;He certainly had not the least idea of what would follow, but he&#10;was curious, and curiosity often brings its own punishment. In his&#10;eagerness, he came so near the edge of the purse that he slipped&#10;out into the pocket of the trousers; and when, in the evening, the&#10;purse was taken out, the shilling was left behind in the corner to&#10;which it had fallen. As the clothes were being carried into the&#10;hall, the shilling fell out on the floor, unheard and unnoticed by&#10;any one. The next morning the clothes were taken back to the room,&#10;the gentleman put them on, and started on his journey again; but&#10;the shilling remained behind on the floor. After a time it was&#10;found, and being considered a good coin, was placed with three&#10;other coins. &#34;Ah,&#34; thought the shilling, &#34;this is pleasant; I shall&#10;now see the world, become acquainted with other people, and learn&#10;other customs.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Do you call that a shilling?&#34; said some one the next&#10;moment. &#34;That is not a genuine coin of the country,&#8212;it is false; it&#10;is good for nothing.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Now begins the story as it was afterwards related by the&#10;shilling himself.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;False! good for nothing!&#39; said he. That remark went&#10;through and through me like a dagger. I knew that I had a true&#10;ring, and that mine was a genuine stamp. These people must at all&#10;events be wrong, or they could not mean me. But yes, I was the one&#10;they called &#39;false, and good for nothing.&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;Then I must pay it away in the dark,&#39; said the man who&#10;had received me. So I was to be got rid of in the darkness, and be&#10;again insulted in broad daylight.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;False! good for nothing!&#39; Oh, I must contrive to get&#10;lost, thought I. And I trembled between the fingers of the people&#10;every time they tried to pass me off slyly as a coin of the&#10;country. Ah! unhappy shilling that I was! Of what use were my&#10;silver, my stamp, and my real value here, where all these qualities&#10;were worthless. In the eyes of the world, a man is valued just&#10;according to the opinion formed of him. It must be a shocking thing&#10;to have a guilty conscience, and to be sneaking about on account of&#10;wicked deeds. As for me, innocent as I was, I could not help&#10;shuddering before their eyes whenever they brought me out, for I&#10;knew I should be thrown back again up the table as a false&#10;pretender. At length I was paid away to a poor old woman, who&#10;received me as wages for a hard day&#39;s work. But she could not again&#10;get rid of me; no one would take me. I was to the woman a most&#10;unlucky shilling. &#39;I am positively obliged to pass this shilling to&#10;somebody,&#39; said she; &#39;I cannot, with the best intentions, lay by a&#10;bad shilling. The rich baker shall have it,&#8212;he can bear the loss&#10;better than I can. But, after all, it is not a right thing to&#10;do.&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;Ah!&#39; sighed I to myself, &#39;am I also to be a burden on&#10;the conscience of this poor woman? Am I then in my old days so&#10;completely changed?&#39; The woman offered me to the rich baker, but he&#10;knew the current money too well, and as soon as he received me he&#10;threw me almost in the woman&#39;s face. She could get no bread for me,&#10;and I felt quite grieved to the heart that I should be cause of so&#10;much trouble to another, and be treated as a cast-off coin. I who,&#10;in my young days, felt so joyful in the certainty of my own value,&#10;and knew so well that I bore a genuine stamp. I was as sorrowful&#10;now as a poor shilling can be when nobody will have him. The woman&#10;took me home again with her, and looking at me very earnestly, she&#10;said, &#39;No, I will not try to deceive any one with thee again. I&#10;will bore a hole through thee, that everyone may know that thou art&#10;a false and worthless thing; and yet, why should I do that? Very&#10;likely thou art a lucky shilling. A thought has just struck me that&#10;it is so, and I believe it. Yes, I will make a hole in the&#10;shilling,&#39; said she, &#39;and run a string through it, and then give it&#10;to my neighbor&#39;s little one to hang round her neck, as a lucky&#10;shilling.&#39; So she drilled a hole through me.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It is really not at all pleasant to have a hole bored&#10;through one, but we can submit to a great deal when it is done with&#10;a good intention. A string was drawn through the hole, and I became&#10;a kind of medal. They hung me round the neck of a little child, and&#10;the child laughed at me and kissed me, and I rested for one whole&#10;night on the warm, innocent breast of a child.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;In the morning the child&#39;s mother took me between her&#10;fingers, and had certain thoughts about me, which I very soon found&#10;out. First, she looked for a pair of scissors, and cut the&#10;string.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;Lucky shilling!&#39; said she, &#39;certainly this is what I&#10;mean to try.&#39; Then she laid me in vinegar till I became quite&#10;green, and after that she filled up the hole with cement, rubbed me&#10;a little to brighten me up, and went out in the twilight hour to&#10;the lottery collector, to buy herself a ticket, with a shilling&#10;that should bring luck. How everything seemed to cause me trouble.&#10;The lottery collector pressed me so hard that I thought I should&#10;crack. I had been called false, I had been thrown away,&#8212;that I&#10;knew; and there were many shillings and coins with inscriptions and&#10;stamps of all kinds lying about. I well knew how proud they were,&#10;so I avoided them from very shame. With the collector were several&#10;men who seemed to have a great deal to do, so I fell unnoticed into&#10;a chest, among several other coins.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Whether the lottery ticket gained a prize, I know not;&#10;but this I know, that in a very few days after, I was recognized as&#10;a bad shilling, and laid aside. Everything that happened seemed&#10;always to add to my sorrow. Even if a man has a good character, it&#10;is of no use for him to deny what is said of him, for he is not&#10;considered an impartial judge of himself.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;A year passed, and in this way I had been changed from&#10;hand to hand; always abused, always looked at with displeasure, and&#10;trusted by no one; but I trusted in myself, and had no confidence&#10;in the world. Yes, that was a very dark time.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;At length one day I was passed to a traveller, a&#10;foreigner, the very same who had brought me away from home; and he&#10;was simple and true-hearted enough to take me for current coin. But&#10;would he also attempt to pass me? and should I again hear the&#10;outcry, &#39;False! good-for-nothing!&#39; The traveller examined me&#10;attentively, &#39;I took thee for good coin,&#39; said he; then suddenly a&#10;smile spread all over his face. I have never seen such a smile on&#10;any other face as on his. &#39;Now this is singular,&#39; said he, &#39;it is a&#10;coin from my own country; a good, true, shilling from home. Some&#10;one has bored a hole through it, and people have no doubt called it&#10;false. How curious that it should come into my hands. I will take&#10;it home with me to my own house.&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#39;Joy thrilled through me when I heard this. I had been&#10;once more called a good, honest shilling, and I was to go back to&#10;my own home, where each and all would recognize me, and know that I&#10;was made of good silver, and bore a true, genuine stamp. I should&#10;have been glad in my joy to throw out sparks of fire, but it has&#10;never at any time been my nature to sparkle. Steel can do so, but&#10;not silver. I was wrapped up in fine, white paper, that I might not&#10;mix with the other coins and be lost; and on special occasions,&#10;when people from my own country happened to be present, I was&#10;brought forward and spoken of very kindly. They said I was very&#10;interesting, and it was really quite worth while to notice that&#10;those who are interesting have often not a single word to say for&#10;themselves.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;At length I reached home. All my cares were at an end.&#10;Joy again overwhelmed me; for was I not good silver, and had I not&#10;a genuine stamp? I had no more insults or disappointments to&#10;endure; although, indeed, there was a hole through me, as if I were&#10;false; but suspicions are nothing when a man is really true, and&#10;every one should persevere in acting honestly, for an will be made&#10;right in time. That is my firm belief,&#34; said the&#10;shilling.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Shirt-Collar'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;THERE was once a fine gentleman who possessed among other&#10;things a boot-jack and a hair-brush; but he had also the finest&#10;shirt-collar in the world, and of this collar we are about to hear&#10;a story. The collar had become so old that he began to think about&#10;getting married; and one day he happened to find himself in the&#10;same washing-tub as a garter. &#34;Upon my word,&#34; said the&#10;shirt-collar, &#34;I have never seen anything so slim and delicate, so&#10;neat and soft before. May I venture to ask your name?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I shall not tell you,&#34; replied the garter.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Where do you reside when you are at home?&#34; asked the&#10;shirt-collar. But the garter was naturally shy, and did not know&#10;how to answer such a question.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I presume you are a girdle,&#34; said the shirt-collar, &#34;a&#10;sort of under girdle. I see that you are useful, as well as&#10;ornamental, my little lady.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You must not speak to me,&#34; said the garter; &#34;I do not&#10;think I have given you any encouragement to do so.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, when any one is as beautiful as you are,&#34; said the&#10;shirt-collar, &#34;is not that encouragement enough?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Get away; don&#39;t come so near me,&#34; said the garter, &#34;you&#10;appear to me quite like a man.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I am a fine gentleman certainly,&#34; said the shirt-collar,&#10;&#34;I possess a boot-jack and a hair-brush.&#34; This was not true, for&#10;these things belonged to his master; but he was a&#10;boaster.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Don&#39;t come so near me,&#34; said the garter; &#34;I am not&#10;accustomed to it.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Affectation!&#34; said the shirt-collar.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then they were taken out of the wash-tub, starched, and&#10;hung over a chair in the sunshine, and then laid on the&#10;ironing-board. And now came the glowing iron. &#34;Mistress widow,&#34;&#10;said the shirt-collar, &#34;little mistress widow, I feel quite warm. I&#10;am changing, I am losing all my creases. You are burning a hole in&#10;me. Ugh! I propose to you.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You old rag,&#34; said the flat-iron, driving proudly over&#10;the collar, for she fancied herself a steam-engine, which rolls&#10;over the railway and draws carriages. &#34;You old rag!&#34; said&#10;she.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The edges of the shirt-collar were a little frayed, so the&#10;scissors were brought to cut them smooth. &#34;Oh!&#34; exclaimed the&#10;shirt-collar, &#34;what a first-rate dancer you would make; you can&#10;stretch out your leg so well. I never saw anything so charming; I&#10;am sure no human being could do the same.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I should think not,&#34; replied the scissors.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You ought to be a countess,&#34; said the shirt collar; &#34;but&#10;all I possess consists of a fine gentleman, a boot-jack, and a&#10;comb. I wish I had an estate for your sake.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What! is he going to propose to me?&#34; said the scissors,&#10;and she became so angry that she cut too sharply into the shirt&#10;collar, and it was obliged to be thrown by as useless.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I shall be obliged to propose to the hair-brush,&#34; thought&#10;the shirt collar; so he remarked one day, &#34;It is wonderful what&#10;beautiful hair you have, my little lady. Have you never thought of&#10;being engaged?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You might know I should think of it,&#34; answered the hair&#10;brush; &#34;I am engaged to the boot-jack.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Engaged!&#34; cried the shirt collar, &#34;now there is no one&#10;left to propose to;&#34; and then he pretended to despise all&#10;love-making.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A long time passed, and the shirt collar was taken in a&#10;bag to the paper-mill. Here was a large company of rags, the fine&#10;ones lying by themselves, separated from the coarser, as it ought&#10;to be. They had all many things to relate, especially the shirt&#10;collar, who was a terrible boaster. &#34;I have had an immense number&#10;of love affairs,&#34; said the shirt collar, &#34;no one left me any peace.&#10;It is true I was a very fine gentleman; quite stuck up. I had a&#10;boot-jack and a brush that I never used. You should have seen me&#10;then, when I was turned down. I shall never forget my first love;&#10;she was a girdle, so charming, and fine, and soft, and she threw&#10;herself into a washing tub for my sake. There was a widow too, who&#10;was warmly in love with me, but I left her alone, and she became&#10;quite black. The next was a first-rate dancer; she gave me the&#10;wound from which I still suffer, she was so passionate. Even my own&#10;hair-brush was in love with me, and lost all her hair through&#10;neglected love. Yes, I have had great experience of this kind, but&#10;my greatest grief was for the garter&#8212;the girdle I meant to say&#8212;that&#10;jumped into the wash-tub. I have a great deal on my conscience, and&#10;it is really time I should be turned into white paper.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the shirt collar came to this at last. All the rags&#10;were made into white paper, and the shirt collar became the very&#10;identical piece of paper which we now see, and on which this story&#10;is printed. It happened as a punishment to him, for having boasted&#10;so shockingly of things which were not true. And this is a warning&#10;to us, to be careful how we act, for we may some day find ourselves&#10;in the rag-bag, to be turned into white paper, on which our whole&#10;history may be written, even its most secret actions. And it would&#10;not be pleasant to have to run about the world in the form of a&#10;piece of paper, telling everything we have done, like the boasting&#10;shirt collar.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Snow Man'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;IT is so delightfully cold,&#34; said the Snow Man, &#34;that it&#10;makes my whole body crackle. This is just the kind of wind to blow&#10;life into one. How that great red thing up there is staring at me!&#34;&#10;He meant the sun, who was just setting. &#34;It shall not make me wink.&#10;I shall manage to keep the pieces.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;He had two triangular pieces of tile in his head, instead&#10;of eyes; his mouth was made of an old broken rake, and was, of&#10;course, furnished with teeth. He had been brought into existence&#10;amidst the joyous shouts of boys, the jingling of sleigh-bells, and&#10;the slashing of whips. The sun went down, and the full moon rose,&#10;large, round, and clear, shining in the deep blue.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;There it comes again, from the other side,&#34; said the Snow&#10;Man, who supposed the sun was showing himself once more. &#34;Ah, I&#10;have cured him of staring, though; now he may hang up there, and&#10;shine, that I may see myself. If I only knew how to manage to move&#10;away from this place,&#8212;I should so like to move. If I could, I would&#10;slide along yonder on the ice, as I have seen the boys do; but I&#10;don&#39;t understand how; I don&#39;t even know how to run.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Away, away,&#34; barked the old yard-dog. He was quite&#10;hoarse, and could not pronounce &#34;Bow wow&#34; properly. He had once&#10;been an indoor dog, and lay by the fire, and he had been hoarse&#10;ever since. &#34;The sun will make you run some day. I saw him, last&#10;winter, make your predecessor run, and his predecessor before him.&#10;Away, away, they all have to go.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I don&#39;t understand you, comrade,&#34; said the Snow Man. &#34;Is&#10;that thing up yonder to teach me to run? I saw it running itself a&#10;little while ago, and now it has come creeping up from the other&#10;side.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You know nothing at all,&#34; replied the yard-dog; &#34;but&#10;then, you&#39;ve only lately been patched up. What you see yonder is&#10;the moon, and the one before it was the sun. It will come again&#10;to-morrow, and most likely teach you to run down into the ditch by&#10;the well; for I think the weather is going to change. I can feel&#10;such pricks and stabs in my left leg; I am sure there is going to&#10;be a change.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I don&#39;t understand him,&#34; said the Snow Man to himself;&#10;&#34;but I have a feeling that he is talking of something very&#10;disagreeable. The one who stared so just now, and whom he calls the&#10;sun, is not my friend; I can feel that too.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Away, away,&#34; barked the yard-dog, and then he turned&#10;round three times, and crept into his kennel to sleep.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;There was really a change in the weather. Towards morning,&#10;a thick fog covered the whole country round, and a keen wind arose,&#10;so that the cold seemed to freeze one&#39;s bones; but when the sun&#10;rose, the sight was splendid. Trees and bushes were covered with&#10;hoar frost, and looked like a forest of white coral; while on every&#10;twig glittered frozen dew-drops. The many delicate forms concealed&#10;in summer by luxuriant foliage, were now clearly defined, and&#10;looked like glittering lace-work. From every twig glistened a white&#10;radiance. The birch, waving in the wind, looked full of life, like&#10;trees in summer; and its appearance was wondrously beautiful. And&#10;where the sun shone, how everything glittered and sparkled, as if&#10;diamond dust had been strewn about; while the snowy carpet of the&#10;earth appeared as if covered with diamonds, from which countless&#10;lights gleamed, whiter than even the snow itself.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;This is really beautiful,&#34; said a young girl, who had&#10;come into the garden with a young man; and they both stood still&#10;near the Snow Man, and contemplated the glittering scene. &#34;Summer&#10;cannot show a more beautiful sight,&#34; she exclaimed, while her eyes&#10;sparkled.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And we can&#39;t have such a fellow as this in the summer&#10;time,&#34; replied the young man, pointing to the Snow Man; &#34;he is&#10;capital.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The girl laughed, and nodded at the Snow Man, and then&#10;tripped away over the snow with her friend. The snow creaked and&#10;crackled beneath her feet, as if she had been treading on&#10;starch.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Who are these two?&#34; asked the Snow Man of the yard-dog.&#10;&#34;You have been here longer than I have; do you know&#10;them?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Of course I know them,&#34; replied the yard-dog; &#34;she has&#10;stroked my back many times, and he has given me a bone of meat. I&#10;never bite those two.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But what are they?&#34; asked the Snow Man.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;They are lovers,&#34; he replied; &#34;they will go and live in&#10;the same kennel by-and-by, and gnaw at the same bone. Away,&#10;away!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Are they the same kind of beings as you and I?&#34; asked the&#10;Snow Man.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Well, they belong to the same master,&#34; retorted the&#10;yard-dog. &#34;Certainly people who were only born yesterday know very&#10;little. I can see that in you. I have age and experience. I know&#10;every one here in the house, and I know there was once a time when&#10;I did not lie out here in the cold, fastened to a chain. Away,&#10;away!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The cold is delightful,&#34; said the Snow Man; &#34;but do tell&#10;me tell me; only you must not clank your chain so; for it jars all&#10;through me when you do that.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Away, away!&#34; barked the yard-dog; &#34;I&#39;ll tell you; they&#10;said I was a pretty little fellow once; then I used to lie in a&#10;velvet-covered chair, up at the master&#39;s house, and sit in the&#10;mistress&#39;s lap. They used to kiss my nose, and wipe my paws with an&#10;embroidered handkerchief, and I was called &#39;Ami, dear Ami, sweet&#10;Ami.&#39; But after a while I grew too big for them, and they sent me&#10;away to the housekeeper&#39;s room; so I came to live on the lower&#10;story. You can look into the room from where you stand, and see&#10;where I was master once; for I was indeed master to the&#10;housekeeper. It was certainly a smaller room than those up stairs;&#10;but I was more comfortable; for I was not being continually taken&#10;hold of and pulled about by the children as I had been. I received&#10;quite as good food, or even better. I had my own cushion, and there&#10;was a stove&#8212;it is the finest thing in the world at this season of&#10;the year. I used to go under the stove, and lie down quite beneath&#10;it. Ah, I still dream of that stove. Away, away!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Does a stove look beautiful?&#34; asked the Snow Man, &#34;is it&#10;at all like me?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It is just the reverse of you,&#39; said the dog; &#34;it&#39;s as&#10;black as a crow, and has a long neck and a brass knob; it eats&#10;firewood, so that fire spurts out of its mouth. We should keep on&#10;one side, or under it, to be comfortable. You can see it through&#10;the window, from where you stand.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the Snow Man looked, and saw a bright polished thing&#10;with a brazen knob, and fire gleaming from the lower part of it.&#10;The Snow Man felt quite a strange sensation come over him; it was&#10;very odd, he knew not what it meant, and he could not account for&#10;it. But there are people who are not men of snow, who understand&#10;what it is. &#34;&#39;And why did you leave her?&#34; asked the Snow Man, for&#10;it seemed to him that the stove must be of the female sex. &#34;How&#10;could you give up such a comfortable place?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I was obliged,&#34; replied the yard-dog. &#34;They turned me out&#10;of doors, and chained me up here. I had bitten the youngest of my&#10;master&#39;s sons in the leg, because he kicked away the bone I was&#10;gnawing. &#39;Bone for bone,&#39; I thought; but they were so angry, and&#10;from that time I have been fastened with a chain, and lost my bone.&#10;Don&#39;t you hear how hoarse I am. Away, away! I can&#39;t talk any more&#10;like other dogs. Away, away, that is the end of it all.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But the Snow Man was no longer listening. He was looking&#10;into the housekeeper&#39;s room on the lower storey; where the stove&#10;stood on its four iron legs, looking about the same size as the&#10;Snow Man himself. &#34;What a strange crackling I feel within me,&#34; he&#10;said. &#34;Shall I ever get in there? It is an innocent wish, and&#10;innocent wishes are sure to be fulfilled. I must go in there and&#10;lean against her, even if I have to break the window.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You must never go in there,&#34; said the yard-dog, &#34;for if&#10;you approach the stove, you&#39;ll melt away, away.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I might as well go,&#34; said the Snow Man, &#34;for I think I am&#10;breaking up as it is.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;During the whole day the Snow Man stood looking in through&#10;the window, and in the twilight hour the room became still more&#10;inviting, for from the stove came a gentle glow, not like the sun&#10;or the moon; no, only the bright light which gleams from a stove&#10;when it has been well fed. When the door of the stove was opened,&#10;the flames darted out of its mouth; this is customary with all&#10;stoves. The light of the flames fell directly on the face and&#10;breast of the Snow Man with a ruddy gleam. &#34;I can endure it no&#10;longer,&#34; said he; &#34;how beautiful it looks when it stretches out its&#10;tongue?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The night was long, but did not appear so to the Snow Man,&#10;who stood there enjoying his own reflections, and crackling with&#10;the cold. In the morning, the window-panes of the housekeeper&#39;s&#10;room were covered with ice. They were the most beautiful&#10;ice-flowers any Snow Man could desire, but they concealed the&#10;stove. These window-panes would not thaw, and he could see nothing&#10;of the stove, which he pictured to himself, as if it had been a&#10;lovely human being. The snow crackled and the wind whistled around&#10;him; it was just the kind of frosty weather a Snow Man might&#10;thoroughly enjoy. But he did not enjoy it; how, indeed, could he&#10;enjoy anything when he was &#34;stove sick?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That is terrible disease for a Snow Man,&#34; said the&#10;yard-dog; &#34;I have suffered from it myself, but I got over it. Away,&#10;away,&#34; he barked and then he added, &#34;the weather is going to&#10;change.&#34; And the weather did change; it began to thaw. As the&#10;warmth increased, the Snow Man decreased. He said nothing and made&#10;no complaint, which is a sure sign. One morning he broke, and sunk&#10;down altogether; and, behold, where he had stood, something like a&#10;broomstick remained sticking up in the ground. It was the pole&#10;round which the boys had built him up. &#34;Ah, now I understand why he&#10;had such a great longing for the stove,&#34; said the yard-dog. &#34;Why,&#10;there&#39;s the shovel that is used for cleaning out the stove,&#10;fastened to the pole.&#34; The Snow Man had a stove scraper in his&#10;body; that was what moved him so. &#34;But it&#39;s all over now. Away,&#10;away.&#34; And soon the winter passed. &#34;Away, away,&#34; barked the hoarse&#10;yard-dog. But the girls in the house sang,&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Come from your fragrant home, green thyme;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160; Stretch your soft branches, willow-tree;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;The months are bringing the sweet spring-time,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160; When the lark in the sky sings joyfully.&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Come gentle sun, while the cuckoo sings,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;&#38;#160; And I&#39;ll mock his note in my wanderings.&#34;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And nobody thought any more of the Snow Man.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)

Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Snowdrop'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;IT was winter-time; the air was cold, the wind was sharp,&#10;but within the closed doors it was warm and comfortable, and within&#10;the closed door lay the flower; it lay in the bulb under the&#10;snow-covered earth.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;One day rain fell. The drops penetrated through the snowy&#10;covering down into the earth, and touched the flower-bulb, and&#10;talked of the bright world above. Soon the Sunbeam pierced its way&#10;through the snow to the root, and within the root there was a&#10;stirring.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Come in,&#34; said the flower.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I cannot,&#34; said the Sunbeam. &#34;I am not strong enough to&#10;unlock the door! When the summer comes I shall be&#10;strong!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;When will it be summer?&#34; asked the Flower, and she&#10;repeated this question each time a new sunbeam made its way down to&#10;her. But the summer was yet far distant. The snow still lay upon&#10;the ground, and there was a coat of ice on the water every&#10;night.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What a long time it takes! what a long time it takes!&#34;&#10;said the Flower. &#34;I feel a stirring and striving within me; I must&#10;stretch myself, I must unlock the door, I must get out, and must&#10;nod a good morning to the summer, and what a happy time that will&#10;be!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the Flower stirred and stretched itself within the&#10;thin rind which the water had softened from without, and the snow&#10;and the earth had warmed, and the Sunbeam had knocked at; and it&#10;shot forth under the snow with a greenish-white blossom on a green&#10;stalk, with narrow thick leaves, which seemed to want to protect&#10;it. The snow was cold, but was pierced by the Sunbeam, therefore it&#10;was easy to get through it, and now the Sunbeam came with greater&#10;strength than before.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Welcome, welcome!&#34; sang and sounded every ray, and the&#10;Flower lifted itself up over the snow into the brighter world. The&#10;Sunbeams caressed and kissed it, so that it opened altogether,&#10;white as snow, and ornamented with green stripes. It bent its head&#10;in joy and humility.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Beautiful Flower!&#34; said the Sunbeams, &#34;how graceful and&#10;delicate you are! You are the first, you are the only one! You are&#10;our love! You are the bell that rings out for summer, beautiful&#10;summer, over country and town. All the snow will melt; the cold&#10;winds will be driven away; we shall rule; all will become green,&#10;and then you will have companions, syringas, laburnums, and roses;&#10;but you are the first, so graceful, so delicate!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;That was a great pleasure. It seemed as if the air were&#10;singing and sounding, as if rays of light were piercing through the&#10;leaves and the stalks of the Flower. There it stood, so delicate&#10;and so easily broken, and yet so strong in its young beauty; it&#10;stood there in its white dress with the green stripes, and made a&#10;summer. But there was a long time yet to the summer-time. Clouds&#10;hid the sun, and bleak winds were blowing.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You have come too early,&#34; said Wind and Weather. &#34;We have&#10;still the power, and you shall feel it, and give it up to us. You&#10;should have stayed quietly at home and not have run out to make a&#10;display of yourself. Your time is not come yet!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was a cutting cold! The days which now come brought not&#10;a single sunbeam. It was weather that might break such a little&#10;Flower in two with cold. But the Flower had more strength than she&#10;herself knew of. She was strong in joy and in faith in the summer,&#10;which would be sure to come, which had been announced by her deep&#10;longing and confirmed by the warm sunlight; and so she remained&#10;standing in confidence in the snow in her white garment, bending&#10;her head even while the snow-flakes fell thick and heavy, and the&#10;icy winds swept over her.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You&#39;ll break!&#34; they said, &#34;and fade, and fade! What did&#10;you want out here? Why did you let yourself be tempted? The Sunbeam&#10;only made game of you. Now you have what you deserve, you summer&#10;gauk.&#34;&#38;#160; &#34;Summer gauk!&#34; she repeated in the cold morning&#10;hour.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;O summer gauk!&#34; cried some children rejoicingly; &#34;yonder&#10;stands one&#8212;how beautiful, how beautiful! The first one, the only&#10;one!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;These words did the Flower so much good, they seemed to&#10;her like warm sunbeams. In her joy the Flower did not even feel&#10;when it was broken off. It lay in a child&#39;s hand, and was kissed by&#10;a child&#39;s mouth, and carried into a warm room, and looked on by&#10;gentle eyes, and put into water. How strengthening, how&#10;invigorating! The Flower thought she had suddenly come upon the&#10;summer.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The daughter of the house, a beautiful little girl, was&#10;confirmed, and she had a friend who was confirmed, too. He was&#10;studying for an examination for an appointment. &#34;He shall be my&#10;summer gauk,&#34; she said; and she took the delicate Flower and laid&#10;it in a piece of scented paper, on which verses were written,&#10;beginning with summer gauk and ending with summer gauk. &#34;My friend,&#10;be a winter gauk.&#34; She had twitted him with the summer. Yes, all&#10;this was in the verses, and the paper was folded up like a letter,&#10;and the Flower was folded in the letter, too. It was dark around&#10;her, dark as in those days when she lay hidden in the bulb. The&#10;Flower went forth on her journey, and lay in the post-bag, and was&#10;pressed and crushed, which was not at all pleasant; but that soon&#10;came to an end.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The journey was over; the letter was opened, and read by&#10;the dear friend. How pleased he was! He kissed the letter, and it&#10;was laid, with its enclosure of verses, in a box, in which there&#10;were many beautiful verses, but all of them without flowers; she&#10;was the first, the only one, as the Sunbeams had called her; and it&#10;was a pleasant thing to think of that.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;She had time enough, moreover, to think about it; she&#10;thought of it while the summer passed away, and the long winter&#10;went by, and the summer came again, before she appeared once more.&#10;But now the young man was not pleased at all. He took hold of the&#10;letter very roughly, and threw the verses away, so that the Flower&#10;fell on the ground. Flat and faded she certainly was, but why&#10;should she be thrown on the ground? Still, it was better to be here&#10;than in the fire, where the verses and the paper were being burnt&#10;to ashes. What had happened? What happens so often:&#8212;the Flower had&#10;made a gauk of him, that was a jest; the girl had made a fool of&#10;him, that was no jest, she had, during the summer, chosen another&#10;friend.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Next morning the sun shone in upon the little flattened&#10;Snowdrop, that looked as if it had been painted upon the floor. The&#10;servant girl, who was sweeping out the room, picked it up, and laid&#10;it in one of the books which were upon the table, in the belief&#10;that it must have fallen out while the room was being arranged.&#10;Again the flower lay among verses&#8212;printed verses&#8212;and they are&#10;better than written ones&#8212;at least, more money has been spent upon&#10;them.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And after this years went by. The book stood upon the&#10;book-shelf, and then it was taken up and somebody read out of it.&#10;It was a good book; verses and songs by the old Danish poet,&#10;Ambrosius Stub, which are well worth reading. The man who was now&#10;reading the book turned over a page.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Why, there&#39;s a flower!&#34; he said; &#34;a snowdrop, a summer&#10;gauk, a poet gauk! That flower must have been put in there with a&#10;meaning! Poor Ambrosius Stub! he was a summer fool too, a poet&#10;fool; he came too early, before his time, and therefore he had to&#10;taste the sharp winds, and wander about as a guest from one noble&#10;landed proprietor to another, like a flower in a glass of water, a&#10;flower in rhymed verses! Summer fool, winter fool, fun and&#10;folly&#8212;but the first, the only, the fresh young Danish poet of those&#10;days. Yes, thou shalt remain as a token in the book, thou little&#10;snowdrop: thou hast been put there with a meaning.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And so the Snowdrop was put back into the book, and felt&#10;equally honored and pleased to know that it was a token in the&#10;glorious book of songs, and that he who was the first to sing and&#10;to write had been also a snowdrop, had been a summer gauk, and had&#10;been looked upon in the winter-time as a fool. The Flower&#10;understood this, in her way, as we interpret everything in our&#10;way.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;That is the story of the Snowdrop.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;Something'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I MEAN to be somebody, and do something useful in the&#10;world,&#34; said the eldest of five brothers. &#34;I don&#39;t care how humble&#10;my position is, so that I can only do some good, which will be&#10;something. I intend to be a brickmaker; bricks are always wanted,&#10;and I shall be really doing something.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Your &#39;something&#39; is not enough for me,&#34; said the second&#10;brother; &#34;what you talk of doing is nothing at all, it is&#10;journeyman&#39;s work, or might even be done by a machine. No! I should&#10;prefer to be a builder at once, there is something real in that. A&#10;man gains a position, he becomes a citizen, has his own sign, his&#10;own house of call for his workmen: so I shall be a builder. If all&#10;goes well, in time I shall become a master, and have my own&#10;journeymen, and my wife will be treated as a master&#39;s wife. This is&#10;what I call something.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I call it all nothing,&#34; said the third; &#34;not in reality&#10;any position. There are many in a town far above a master builder&#10;in position. You may be an upright man, but even as a master you&#10;will only be ranked among common men. I know better what to do than&#10;that. I will be an architect, which will place me among those who&#10;possess riches and intellect, and who speculate in art. I shall&#10;certainly have to rise by my own endeavors from a bricklayer&#39;s&#10;laborer, or as a carpenter&#39;s apprentice&#8212;a lad wearing a paper cap,&#10;although I now wear a silk hat. I shall have to fetch beer and&#10;spirits for the journeymen, and they will call me &#39;thou,&#39; which&#10;will be an insult. I shall endure it, however, for I shall look&#10;upon it all as a mere representation, a masquerade, a mummery,&#10;which to-morrow, that is, when I myself as a journeyman, shall have&#10;served my time, will vanish, and I shall go my way, and all that&#10;has passed will be nothing to me. Then I shall enter the academy,&#10;and get instructed in drawing, and be called an architect. I may&#10;even attain to rank, and have something placed before or after my&#10;name, and I shall build as others have done before me. By this&#10;there will be always &#39;something&#39; to make me remembered, and is not&#10;that worth living for?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Not in my opinion,&#34; said the fourth; &#34;I will never follow&#10;the lead of others, and only imitate what they have done. I will be&#10;a genius, and become greater than all of you together. I will&#10;create a new style of building, and introduce a plan for erecting&#10;houses suitable to the climate, with material easily obtained in&#10;the country, and thus suit national feeling and the developments of&#10;the age, besides building a storey for my own genius.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But supposing the climate and the material are not good&#10;for much,&#34; said the fifth brother, &#34;that would be very unfortunate&#10;for you, and have an influence over your experiments. Nationality&#10;may assert itself until it becomes affectation, and the&#10;developments of a century may run wild, as youth often does. I see&#10;clearly that none of you will ever really be anything worth notice,&#10;however you may now fancy it. But do as you like, I shall not&#10;imitate you. I mean to keep clear of all these things, and&#10;criticize what you do. In every action something imperfect may be&#10;discovered, something not right, which I shall make it my business&#10;to find out and expose; that will be something, I fancy.&#34; And he&#10;kept his word, and became a critic.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;People said of this fifth brother, &#34;There is something&#10;very precise about him; he has a good head-piece, but he does&#10;nothing.&#34; And on that very account they thought he must be&#10;something.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Now, you see, this is a little history which will never&#10;end; as long as the world exists, there will always be men like&#10;these five brothers. And what became of them? Were they each&#10;nothing or something? You shall hear; it is quite a&#10;history.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The eldest brother, he who fabricated bricks, soon&#10;discovered that each brick, when finished, brought him in a small&#10;coin, if only a copper one; and many copper pieces, if placed one&#10;upon another, can be changed into a shining shilling; and at&#10;whatever door a person knocks, who has a number of these in his&#10;hands, whether it be the baker&#39;s, the butcher&#39;s, or the tailor&#39;s,&#10;the door flies open, and he can get all he wants. So you see the&#10;value of bricks. Some of the bricks, however, crumbled to pieces,&#10;or were broken, but the elder brother found a use for even&#10;these.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;On the high bank of earth, which formed a dyke on the&#10;sea-coast, a poor woman named Margaret wished to build herself a&#10;house, so all the imperfect bricks were given to her, and a few&#10;whole ones with them; for the eldest brother was a kind-hearted&#10;man, although he never achieved anything higher than making bricks.&#10;The poor woman built herself a little house&#8212;it was small and&#10;narrow, and the window was quite crooked, the door too low, and the&#10;straw roof might have been better thatched. But still it was a&#10;shelter, and from within you could look far over the sea, which&#10;dashed wildly against the sea-wall on which the little house was&#10;built. The salt waves sprinkled their white foam over it, but it&#10;stood firm, and remained long after he who had given the bricks to&#10;build it was dead and buried.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The second brother of course knew better how to build than&#10;poor Margaret, for he served an apprenticeship to learn it. When&#10;his time was up, he packed up his knapsack, and went on his&#10;travels, singing the journeyman&#39;s song,&#8212;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;While young, I can wander without a care,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;And build new houses everywhere;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Fair and bright are my dreams of home,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Always thought of wherever I roam.&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Hurrah for a workman&#39;s life of glee!&#60;br /&#62;&#10;There&#39;s a loved one at home who thinks of me;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Home and friends I can ne&#39;er forget,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;And I mean to be a master yet.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And that is what he did. On his return home, he became a&#10;master builder,&#8212;built one house after another in the town, till&#10;they formed quite a street, which, when finished, became really an&#10;ornament to the town. These houses built a house for him in return,&#10;which was to be his own. But how can houses build a house? If the&#10;houses were asked, they could not answer; but the people would&#10;understand, and say, &#34;Certainly the street built his house for&#10;him.&#34; It was not very large, and the floor was of lime; but when he&#10;danced with his bride on the lime-covered floor, it was to him&#10;white and shining, and from every stone in the wall flowers seemed&#10;to spring forth and decorate the room as with the richest tapestry.&#10;It was really a pretty house, and in it were a happy pair. The flag&#10;of the corporation fluttered before it, and the journeymen and&#10;apprentices shouted &#34;Hurrah.&#34; He had gained his position, he had&#10;made himself something, and at last he died, which was &#34;something&#34;&#10;too.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Now we come to the architect, the third brother, who had&#10;been first a carpenter&#39;s apprentice, had worn a cap, and served as&#10;an errand boy, but afterwards went to the academy, and risen to be&#10;an architect, a high and noble gentleman. Ah yes, the houses of the&#10;new street, which the brother who was a master builder erected, may&#10;have built his house for him, but the street received its name from&#10;the architect, and the handsomest house in the street became his&#10;property. That was something, and he was &#34;something,&#34; for he had a&#10;list of titles before and after his name. His children were called&#10;&#34;wellborn,&#34; and when he died, his widow was treated as a lady of&#10;position, and that was &#34;something.&#34; His name remained always&#10;written at the corner of the street, and lived in every one&#39;s mouth&#10;as its name. Yes, this also was something.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And what about the genius of the family&#8212;the fourth&#10;brother&#8212;who wanted to invent something new and original? He tried&#10;to build a lofty storey himself, but it fell to pieces, and he fell&#10;with it and broke his neck. However, he had a splendid funeral,&#10;with the city flags and music in the procession; flowers were&#10;strewn on the pavement, and three orations were spoken over his&#10;grave, each one longer than the other. He would have liked this&#10;very much during his life, as well as the poems about him in the&#10;papers, for he liked nothing so well as to be talked of. A monument&#10;was also erected over his grave. It was only another storey over&#10;him, but that was &#34;something,&#34; Now he was dead, like the three&#10;other brothers.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The youngest&#8212;the critic&#8212;outlived them all, which was quite&#10;right for him. It gave him the opportunity of having the last word,&#10;which to him was of great importance. People always said he had a&#10;good head-piece. At last his hour came, and he died, and arrived at&#10;the gates of heaven. Souls always enter these gates in pairs; so he&#10;found himself standing and waiting for admission with another; and&#10;who should it be but old dame Margaret, from the house on the dyke!&#10;&#34;It is evidently for the sake of contrast that I and this wretched&#10;soul should arrive here exactly at the same time,&#34; said the critic.&#10;&#34;Pray who are you, my good woman?&#34; said he; &#34;do you want to get in&#10;here too?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the old woman curtsied as well as she could; she&#10;thought it must be St. Peter himself who spoke to her. &#34;I am a poor&#10;old woman,&#34; she said, &#34;without my family. I am old Margaret, that&#10;lived in the house on the dyke.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Well, and what have you done&#8212;what great deed have you&#10;performed down below?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I have done nothing at all in the world that could give&#10;me a claim to have these doors open for me,&#34; she said. &#34;It would be&#10;only through mercy that I can be allowed to slip in through the&#10;gate.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;In what manner did you leave the world?&#34; he asked, just&#10;for the sake of saying something; for it made him feel very weary&#10;to stand there and wait.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;How I left the world?&#34; she replied; &#34;why, I can scarcely&#10;tell you. During the last years of my life I was sick and&#10;miserable, and I was unable to bear creeping out of bed suddenly&#10;into the frost and cold. Last winter was a hard winter, but I have&#10;got over it all now. There were a few mild days, as your honor, no&#10;doubt, knows. The ice lay thickly on the lake, as far one could&#10;see. The people came from the town, and walked upon it, and they&#10;say there were dancing and skating upon it, I believe, and a great&#10;feasting. The sound of beautiful music came into my poor little&#10;room where I lay. Towards evening, when the moon rose beautifully,&#10;though not yet in her full splendor, I glanced from my bed over the&#10;wide sea; and there, just where the sea and sky met, rose a curious&#10;white cloud. I lay looking at the cloud till I observed a little&#10;black spot in the middle of it, which gradually grew larger and&#10;larger, and then I knew what it meant&#8212;I am old and experienced; and&#10;although this token is not often seen, I knew it, and a shuddering&#10;seized me. Twice in my life had I seen this same thing, and I knew&#10;that there would be an awful storm, with a spring tide, which would&#10;overwhelm the poor people who were now out on the ice, drinking,&#10;dancing, and making merry. Young and old, the whole city, were&#10;there; who was to warn them, if no one noticed the sign, or knew&#10;what it meant as I did? I was so alarmed, that I felt more strength&#10;and life than I had done for some time. I got out of bed, and&#10;reached the window; I could not crawl any farther from weakness and&#10;exhaustion; but I managed to open the window. I saw the people&#10;outside running and jumping about on the ice; I saw the beautiful&#10;flags waving in the wind; I heard the boys shouting, &#39;Hurrah!&#39; and&#10;the lads and lasses singing, and everything full of merriment and&#10;joy. But there was the white cloud with the black spot hanging over&#10;them. I cried out as loudly as I could, but no one heard me; I was&#10;too far off from the people. Soon would the storm burst, the ice&#10;break, and all who were on it be irretrievably lost. They could not&#10;hear me, and to go to them was quite out of my power. Oh, if I&#10;could only get them safe on land! Then came the thought, as if from&#10;heaven, that I would rather set fire to my bed, and let the house&#10;be burnt down, than that so many people should perish miserably. I&#10;got a light, and in a few moments the red flames leaped up as a&#10;beacon to them. I escaped fortunately as far as the threshold of&#10;the door; but there I fell down and remained: I could go no&#10;farther. The flames rushed out towards me, flickered on the window,&#10;and rose high above the roof. The people on the ice became aware of&#10;the fire, and ran as fast as possible to help a poor sick woman,&#10;who, as they thought, was being burnt to death. There was not one&#10;who did not run. I heard them coming, and I also at the same time&#10;was conscious of a rush of air and a sound like the roar of heavy&#10;artillery. The spring flood was lifting the ice covering, which&#10;brake into a thousand pieces. But the people had reached the&#10;sea-wall, where the sparks were flying round. I had saved them all;&#10;but I suppose I could not survive the cold and fright; so I came up&#10;here to the gates of paradise. I am told they are open to poor&#10;creatures such as I am, and I have now no house left on earth; but&#10;I do not think that will give me a claim to be admitted&#10;here.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the gates were opened, and an angel led the old woman&#10;in. She had dropped one little straw out of her straw bed, when she&#10;set it on fire to save the lives of so many. It had been changed&#10;into the purest gold&#8212;into gold that constantly grew and expanded&#10;into flowers and fruit of immortal beauty.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;See,&#34; said the angel, pointing to the wonderful straw,&#10;&#34;this is what the poor woman has brought. What dost thou bring? I&#10;know thou hast accomplished nothing, not even made a single brick.&#10;Even if thou couldst return, and at least produce so much, very&#10;likely, when made, the brick would be useless, unless done with a&#10;good will, which is always something. But thou canst not return to&#10;earth, and I can do nothing for thee.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the poor soul, the old mother who had lived in the&#10;house on the dyke, pleaded for him. She said, &#34;His brother made all&#10;the stone and bricks, and sent them to me to build my poor little&#10;dwelling, which was a great deal to do for a poor woman like me.&#10;Could not all these bricks and pieces be as a wall of stone to&#10;prevail for him? It is an act of mercy; he is wanting it now; and&#10;here is the very fountain of mercy.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Then,&#34; said the angel, &#34;thy brother, he who has been&#10;looked upon as the meanest of you all, he whose honest deeds to&#10;thee appeared so humble,&#8212;it is he who has sent you this heavenly&#10;gift. Thou shalt not be turned away. Thou shalt have permission to&#10;stand without the gate and reflect, and repent of thy life on&#10;earth; but thou shalt not be admitted here until thou hast&#10;performed one good deed of repentance, which will indeed for thee&#10;be something.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I could have expressed that better,&#34; thought the critic;&#10;but he did not say it aloud, which for him was SOMETHING, after&#10;all.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;Soup from a Sausage Skewer'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;WE had such an excellent dinner yesterday,&#34; said an old&#10;mouse of the female sex to another who had not been present at the&#10;feast. &#34;I sat number twenty-one below the mouse-king, which was not&#10;a bad place. Shall I tell you what we had? Everything was first&#10;rate. Mouldy bread, tallow candle, and sausage. And then, when we&#10;had finished that course, the same came on all over again; it was&#10;as good as two feasts. We were very sociable, and there was as much&#10;joking and fun as if we had been all of one family circle. Nothing&#10;was left but the sausage skewers, and this formed a subject of&#10;conversation, till at last it turned to the proverb, &#39;Soup from&#10;sausage skins;&#39; or, as the people in the neighboring country call&#10;it, &#39;Soup from a sausage skewer.&#39; Every one had heard the proverb,&#10;but no one had ever tasted the soup, much less prepared it. A&#10;capital toast was drunk to the inventor of the soup, and some one&#10;said he ought to be made a relieving officer to the poor. Was not&#10;that witty? Then the old mouse-king rose and promised that the&#10;young lady-mouse who should learn how best to prepare this&#10;much-admired and savory soup should be his queen, and a year and a&#10;day should be allowed for the purpose.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That was not at all a bad proposal,&#34; said the other&#10;mouse; &#34;but how is the soup made?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ah, that is more than I can tell you. All the young lady&#10;mice were asking the same question. They wished very much to be&#10;queen, but they did not want to take the trouble of going out into&#10;the world to learn how to make soup, which was absolutely necessary&#10;to be done first. But it is not every one who would care to leave&#10;her family, or her happy corner by the fire-side at home, even to&#10;be made queen. It is not always easy to find bacon and cheese-rind&#10;in foreign lands every day, and it is not pleasant to have to&#10;endure hunger, and be perhaps, after all, eaten up alive by the&#10;cat.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Most probably some such thoughts as these discouraged the&#10;majority from going out into the world to collect the required&#10;information. Only four mice gave notice that they were ready to set&#10;out on the journey. They were young and lively, but poor. Each of&#10;them wished to visit one of the four divisions of the world, so&#10;that it might be seen which was the most favored by fortune. Every&#10;one took a sausage skewer as a traveller&#39;s staff, and to remind&#10;them of the object of their journey. They left home early in May,&#10;and none of them returned till the first of May in the following&#10;year, and then only three of them. Nothing was seen or heard of the&#10;fourth, although the day of decision was close at hand. &#34;Ah, yes,&#10;there is always some trouble mixed up with the greatest pleasure,&#34;&#10;said the mouse-king; but he gave orders that all the mice within a&#10;circle of many miles should be invited at once. They were to&#10;assemble in the kitchen, and the three travelled mice were to stand&#10;in a row before them, while a sausage skewer, covered with crape,&#10;was to be stuck up instead of the missing mouse. No one dared to&#10;express an opinion until the king spoke, and desired one of them to&#10;go on with her story. And now we shall hear what she&#10;said.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Storks'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;ON the last house in a little village the storks had built&#10;a nest, and the mother stork sat in it with her four young ones,&#10;who stretched out their necks and pointed their black beaks, which&#10;had not yet turned red like those of the parent birds. A little way&#10;off, on the edge of the roof, stood the father stork, quite upright&#10;and stiff; not liking to be quite idle, he drew up one leg, and&#10;stood on the other, so still that it seemed almost as if he were&#10;carved in wood. &#34;It must look very grand,&#34; thought he, &#34;for my wife&#10;to have a sentry guarding her nest. They do not know that I am her&#10;husband; they will think I have been commanded to stand here, which&#10;is quite aristocratic;&#34; and so he continued standing on one&#10;leg.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the street below were a number of children at play, and&#10;when they caught sight of the storks, one of the boldest amongst&#10;the boys began to sing a song about them, and very soon he was&#10;joined by the rest. These are the words of the song, but each only&#10;sang what he could remember of them in his own&#10;way.&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Stork, stork, fly away,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Stand not on one leg, I pray,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;See your wife is in her nest,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;With her little ones at rest.&#60;br /&#62;&#10;They will hang one,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;And fry another;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;They will shoot a third,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;And roast his brother.&#34;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Just hear what those boys are singing,&#34; said the young&#10;storks; &#34;they say we shall be hanged and roasted.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Never mind what they say; you need not listen,&#34; said the&#10;mother. &#34;They can do no harm.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But the boys went on singing and pointing at the storks,&#10;and mocking at them, excepting one of the boys whose name was&#10;Peter; he said it was a shame to make fun of animals, and would not&#10;join with them at all. The mother stork comforted her young ones,&#10;and told them not to mind. &#34;See,&#34; she said, &#34;How quiet your father&#10;stands, although he is only on one leg.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But we are very much frightened,&#34; said the young storks,&#10;and they drew back their heads into the nests.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The next day when the children were playing together, and&#10;saw the storks, they sang the song again&#8212;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;They will hang one,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;And roast another.&#34;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Shall we be hanged and roasted?&#34; asked the young&#10;storks.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No, certainly not,&#34; said the mother. &#34;I will teach you to&#10;fly, and when you have learnt, we will fly into the meadows, and&#10;pay a visit to the frogs, who will bow themselves to us in the&#10;water, and cry &#39;Croak, croak,&#39; and then we shall eat them up; that&#10;will be fun.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And what next?&#34; asked the young storks.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Then,&#34; replied the mother, &#34;all the storks in the country&#10;will assemble together, and go through their autumn manoeuvres, so&#10;that it is very important for every one to know how to fly&#10;properly. If they do not, the general will thrust them through with&#10;his beak, and kill them. Therefore you must take pains and learn,&#10;so as to be ready when the drilling begins.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Then we may be killed after all, as the boys say; and&#10;hark! they are singing again.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Listen to me, and not to them,&#34; said the mother stork.&#10;&#34;After the great review is over, we shall fly away to warm&#10;countries far from hence, where there are mountains and forests. To&#10;Egypt, where we shall see three-cornered houses built of stone,&#10;with pointed tops that reach nearly to the clouds. They are called&#10;Pyramids, and are older than a stork could imagine; and in that&#10;country, there is a river that overflows its banks, and then goes&#10;back, leaving nothing but mire; there we can walk about, and eat&#10;frogs in abundance.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, o&#8212;h!&#34; cried the young storks.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, it is a delightful place; there is nothing to do all&#10;day long but eat, and while we are so well off out there, in this&#10;country there will not be a single green leaf on the trees, and the&#10;weather will be so cold that the clouds will freeze, and fall on&#10;the earth in little white rags.&#34; The stork meant snow, but she&#10;could not explain it in any other way.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Will the naughty boys freeze and fall in pieces?&#34; asked&#10;the young storks.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No, they will not freeze and fall into pieces,&#34; said the&#10;mother, &#34;but they will be very cold, and be obliged to sit all day&#10;in a dark, gloomy room, while we shall be flying about in foreign&#10;lands, where there are blooming flowers and warm&#10;sunshine.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Time passed on, and the young storks grew so large that&#10;they could stand upright in the nest and look about them. The&#10;father brought them, every day, beautiful frogs, little snakes, and&#10;all kinds of stork-dainties that he could find. And then, how funny&#10;it was to see the tricks he would perform to amuse them. He would&#10;lay his head quite round over his tail, and clatter with his beak,&#10;as if it had been a rattle; and then he would tell them stories all&#10;about the marshes and fens.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Come,&#34; said the mother one day, &#34;Now you must learn to&#10;fly.&#34; And all the four young ones were obliged to come out on the&#10;top of the roof. Oh, how they tottered at first, and were obliged&#10;to balance themselves with their wings, or they would have fallen&#10;to the ground below.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Look at me,&#34; said the mother, &#34;you must hold your heads&#10;in this way, and place your feet so. Once, twice, once, twice&#8212;that&#10;is it. Now you will be able to take care of yourselves in the&#10;world.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then she flew a little distance from them, and the young&#10;ones made a spring to follow her; but down they fell plump, for&#10;their bodies were still too heavy.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I don&#39;t want to fly,&#34; said one of the young storks,&#10;creeping back into the nest. &#34;I don&#39;t care about going to warm&#10;countries.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Would you like to stay here and freeze when the winter&#10;comes?&#34; said the mother, &#34;or till the boys comes to hang you, or to&#10;roast you?&#8212;Well then, I&#39;ll call them.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh no, no,&#34; said the young stork, jumping out on the roof&#10;with the others; and now they were all attentive, and by the third&#10;day could fly a little. Then they began to fancy they could soar,&#10;so they tried to do so, resting on their wings, but they soon found&#10;themselves falling, and had to flap their wings as quickly as&#10;possible. The boys came again in the street singing their&#10;song:&#8212;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Stork, stork, fly away.&#34;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Shall we fly down, and pick their eyes out?&#34; asked the&#10;young storks.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No; leave them alone,&#34; said the mother. &#34;Listen to me;&#10;that is much more important. Now then. One-two-three. Now to the&#10;right. One-two-three. Now to the left, round the chimney. There&#10;now, that was very good. That last flap of the wings was so easy&#10;and graceful, that I shall give you permission to fly with me&#10;to-morrow to the marshes. There will be a number of very superior&#10;storks there with their families, and I expect you to show them&#10;that my children are the best brought up of any who may be present.&#10;You must strut about proudly&#8212;it will look well and make you&#10;respected.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But may we not punish those naughty boys?&#34; asked the&#10;young storks.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No; let them scream away as much as they like. You can&#10;fly from them now up high amid the clouds, and will be in the land&#10;of the pyramids when they are freezing, and have not a green leaf&#10;on the trees or an apple to eat.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;We will revenge ourselves,&#34; whispered the young storks to&#10;each other, as they again joined the exercising.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Of all the boys in the street who sang the mocking song&#10;about the storks, not one was so determined to go on with it as he&#10;who first began it. Yet he was a little fellow not more than six&#10;years old. To the young storks he appeared at least a hundred, for&#10;he was so much bigger than their father and mother. To be sure,&#10;storks cannot be expected to know how old children and grown-up&#10;people are. So they determined to have their revenge on this boy,&#10;because he began the song first and would keep on with it. The&#10;young storks were very angry, and grew worse as they grew older; so&#10;at last their mother was obliged to promise that they should be&#10;revenged, but not until the day of their departure.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;We must see first, how you acquit yourselves at the grand&#10;review,&#34; said she. &#34;If you get on badly there, the general will&#10;thrust his beak through you, and you will be killed, as the boys&#10;said, though not exactly in the same manner. So we must wait and&#10;see.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You shall see,&#34; said the young birds, and then they took&#10;such pains and practised so well every day, that at last it was&#10;quite a pleasure to see them fly so lightly and prettily. As soon&#10;as the autumn arrived, all the storks began to assemble together&#10;before taking their departure for warm countries during the winter.&#10;Then the review commenced. They flew over forests and villages to&#10;show what they could do, for they had a long journey before them.&#10;The young storks performed their part so well that they received a&#10;mark of honor, with frogs and snakes as a present. These presents&#10;were the best part of the affair, for they could eat the frogs and&#10;snakes, which they very quickly did.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Now let us have our revenge,&#34; they cried.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, certainly,&#34; cried the mother stork. &#34;I have thought&#10;upon the best way to be revenged. I know the pond in which all the&#10;little children lie, waiting till the storks come to take them to&#10;their parents. The prettiest little babies lie there dreaming more&#10;sweetly than they will ever dream in the time to come. All parents&#10;are glad to have a little child, and children are so pleased with a&#10;little brother or sister. Now we will fly to the pond and fetch a&#10;little baby for each of the children who did not sing that naughty&#10;song to make game of the storks.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But the naughty boy, who began the song first, what shall&#10;we do to him?&#34; cried the young storks.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;There lies in the pond a little dead baby who has dreamed&#10;itself to death,&#34; said the mother. &#34;We will take it to the naughty&#10;boy, and he will cry because we have brought him a little dead&#10;brother. But you have not forgotten the good boy who said it was a&#10;shame to laugh at animals: we will take him a little brother and&#10;sister too, because he was good. He is called Peter, and you shall&#10;all be called Peter in future.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;So they all did what their mother had arranged, and from&#10;that day, even till now, all the storks have been called&#10;Peter.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Storm Shakes the Shield'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;IN the old days, when grandpapa was quite a little boy,&#10;and ran about in little red breeches and a red coat, and a feather&#10;in his cap&#8212;for that&#39;s the costume the little boys wore in his time&#10;when they were dressed in their best&#8212;many things were very&#10;different from what they are now. There was often a good deal of&#10;show in the streets&#8212;show that we don&#39;t see nowadays, because it has&#10;been abolished as too old-fashioned. Still, it is very interesting&#10;to hear grandfather tell about it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It must really have been a gorgeous sight to behold, in&#10;those days, when the shoemaker brought over the shield, when the&#10;court-house was changed. The silken flag waved to and fro, on the&#10;shield itself a double eagle was displayed, and a big boot; the&#10;youngest lads carried the &#34;welcome,&#34; and the chest of the workmen&#39;s&#10;guild, and their shirt-sleeves were adorned with red and white&#10;ribbons; the elder ones carried drawn swords, each with a lemon&#10;stuck on its point. There was a full band of music, and the most&#10;splendid of all the instruments was the &#34;bird,&#34; as grandfather&#10;called the big stick with the crescent on the top, and all manner&#10;of dingle-dangles hanging to it&#8212;a perfect Turkish clatter of music.&#10;The stick was lifted high in the air, and swung up and down till it&#10;jingled again, and quite dazzled one&#39;s eyes when the sun shone on&#10;all its glory of gold, and silver, and brass.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In front of the procession ran the Harlequin, dressed in&#10;clothes made of all kinds of colored patches artfully sewn&#10;together, with a black face, and bells on his head like a sledge&#10;horse. He beat the people with his bat, which made a great&#10;clattering without hurting them, and the people would crowd&#10;together and fall back, only to advance again the next moment.&#10;Little boys and girls fell over their own toes into the gutter, old&#10;women dispensed digs with their elbows, and looked sour, and took&#10;snuff. One laughed, another chatted; the people thronged the&#10;windows and door-steps, and even all the roofs. The sun shone; and&#10;although they had a little rain too, that was good for the farmer;&#10;and when they got wetted thoroughly, they only thought what a&#10;blessing it was for the country.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And what stories grandpapa could tell! As a little boy he&#10;had seen all these fine doings in their greatest pomp. The oldest&#10;of the policemen used to make a speech from the platform on which&#10;the shield was hung up, and the speech was in verse, as if it had&#10;been made by a poet, as, indeed it had; for three people had&#10;concocted it together, and they had first drunk a good bowl of&#10;punch, so that the speech might turn out well.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the people gave a cheer for the speech, but they&#10;shouted much louder for the Harlequin, when he appeared in front of&#10;the platform, and made a grimace at them.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The fools played the fool most admirably, and drank mead&#10;out of spirit-glasses, which they then flung among the crowd, by&#10;whom they were caught up. Grandfather was the possessor of one of&#10;these glasses, which had been given him by a working mason, who had&#10;managed to catch it. Such a scene was really very pleasant; and the&#10;shield on the new court-house was hung with flowers and green&#10;wreaths.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;One never forgets a feast like that, however old one may&#10;grow,&#34; said grandfather. Nor did he forget it, though he saw many&#10;other grand spectacles in his time, and could tell about them too;&#10;but it was most pleasant of all to hear him tell about the shield&#10;that was brought in the town from the old to the new&#10;court-house.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Once, when he was a little boy, grandpapa had gone with&#10;his parents to see this festivity. He had never yet been in the&#10;metropolis of the country. There were so many people in the&#10;streets, that he thought that the shield was being carried. There&#10;were many shields to be seen; a hundred rooms might have been&#10;filled with pictures, if they had been hung up inside and outside.&#10;At the tailor&#39;s were pictures of all kinds of clothing, to show&#10;that he could stitch up people from the coarsest to the finest; at&#10;the tobacco manufacturer&#39;s were pictures of the most charming&#10;little boys, smoking cigars, just as they do in reality; there were&#10;signs with painted butter, and herring, clerical collars, and&#10;coffins, and inscriptions and announcements into the bargain. A&#10;person could walk up and down for a whole day through the streets,&#10;and tire himself out with looking at the pictures; and then he&#10;would know all about what people lived in the houses, for they had&#10;hung out their shields or signs; and, as grandfather said, it was a&#10;very instructive thing, in a great town, to know at once who the&#10;inhabitants were.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And this is what happened with these shields, when&#10;grandpapa came to the town. He told it me himself, and he hadn&#39;t &#34;a&#10;rogue on his back,&#34; as mother used to tell me he had when he wanted&#10;to make me believe something outrageous, for now he looked quite&#10;trustworthy.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The first night after he came to the town had been&#10;signalized by the most terrible gale ever recorded in the&#10;newspapers&#8212;a gale such as none of the inhabitants had ever before&#10;experienced. The air was dark with flying tiles; old wood-work&#10;crashed and fell; and a wheelbarrow ran up the streets all alone,&#10;only to get out of the way. There was a groaning in the air, and a&#10;howling and a shrieking, and altogether it was a terrible storm.&#10;The water in the canal rose over the banks, for it did not know&#10;where to run. The storm swept over the town, carrying plenty of&#10;chimneys with it, and more than one proud weathercock on a church&#10;tower had to bow, and has never got over it from that&#10;time.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;There was a kind of sentry-house, where dwelt the&#10;venerable old superintendent of the fire brigade, who always&#10;arrived with the last engine. The storm would not leave this little&#10;sentry-house alone, but must needs tear it from its fastenings, and&#10;roll it down the street; and, wonderfully enough, it stopped&#10;opposite to the door of the dirty journeyman plasterer, who had&#10;saved three lives at the last fire, but the sentry-house thought&#10;nothing of that.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The barber&#39;s shield, the great brazen dish, was carried&#10;away, and hurled straight into the embrasure of the councillor of&#10;justice; and the whole neighborhood said this looked almost like&#10;malice, inasmuch as they, and nearly all the friends of the&#10;councillor&#39;s wife, used to call that lady &#34;the Razor&#34; for she was&#10;so sharp that she knew more about other people&#39;s business than they&#10;knew about it themselves.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A shield with a dried salt fish painted on it flew exactly&#10;in front of the door of a house where dwelt a man who wrote a&#10;newspaper. That was a very poor joke perpetrated by the gale, which&#10;seemed to have forgotten that a man who writes in a paper is not&#10;the kind of person to understand any liberty taken with him; for he&#10;is a king in his own newspaper, and likewise in his own&#10;opinion.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The weathercock flew to the opposite house, where he&#10;perched, looking the picture of malice&#8212;so the neighbors&#10;said.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The cooper&#39;s tub stuck itself up under the head of&#10;&#34;ladies&#39; costumes.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The eating-house keeper&#39;s bill of fare, which had hung at&#10;his door in a heavy frame, was posted by the storm over the&#10;entrance to the theatre, where nobody went. &#34;It was a ridiculous&#10;list&#8212;horse-radish, soup, and stuffed cabbage.&#34; And now people came&#10;in plenty.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The fox&#39;s skin, the honorable sign of the furrier, was&#10;found fastened to the bell-pull of a young man who always went to&#10;early lecture, and looked like a furled umbrella. He said he was&#10;striving after truth, and was considered by his aunt &#34;a model and&#10;an example.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The inscription &#34;Institution for Superior Education&#34; was&#10;found near the billiard club, which place of resort was further&#10;adorned with the words, &#34;Children brought up by hand.&#34; Now, this&#10;was not at all witty; but, you see, the storm had done it, and no&#10;one has any control over that.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was a terrible night, and in the morning&#8212;only&#10;think!&#8212;nearly all the shields had changed places. In some places&#10;the inscriptions were so malicious, that grandfather would not&#10;speak of them at all; but I saw that he was chuckling secretly, and&#10;there may have been some inaccuracy in his description, after&#10;all.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The poor people in the town, and still more the strangers,&#10;were continually making mistakes in the people they wanted to see;&#10;nor was this to be avoided, when they went according to the shields&#10;that were hung up. Thus, for instance, some who wanted to go to a&#10;very grave assembly of elderly men, where important affairs were to&#10;be discussed, found themselves in a noisy boys&#39; school, where all&#10;the company were leaping over the chairs and tables.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;There were also people who made a mistake between the&#10;church and the theatre, and that was terrible indeed!&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Such a storm we have never witnessed in our day; for that&#10;only happened in grandpapa&#39;s time, when he was quite a little boy.&#10;Perhaps we shall never experience a storm of the kind, but our&#10;grandchildren may; and we can only hope and pray that all may stay&#10;at home while the storm is moving the shields.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;A Story from the Sand-Hills'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;THIS story is from the sand-dunes or sand-hills of&#10;Jutland, but it does not begin there in the North, but far away in&#10;the South, in Spain. The wide sea is the highroad from nation to&#10;nation; journey in thought; then, to sunny Spain. It is warm and&#10;beautiful there; the fiery pomegranate flowers peep from among dark&#10;laurels; a cool refreshing breeze from the mountains blows over the&#10;orange gardens, over the Moorish halls with their golden cupolas&#10;and coloured walls. Children go through the streets in procession&#10;with candles and waving banners, and the sky, lofty and clear with&#10;its glittering stars, rises above them. Sounds of singing and&#10;castanets can be heard, and youths and maidens dance upon the&#10;flowering acacia trees, while even the beggar sits upon a block of&#10;marble, refreshing himself with a juicy melon, and dreamily&#10;enjoying life. It all seems like a beautiful dream.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Here dwelt a newly married couple who completely gave&#10;themselves up to the charm of life; indeed they possessed every&#10;good thing they could desire&#8212;health and happiness, riches and&#10;honour.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;We are as happy as human beings can be,&#34; said the young&#10;couple from the depths of their hearts. They had indeed only one&#10;step higher to mount on the ladder of happiness&#8212;they hoped that God&#10;would give them a child, a son like them in form and spirit. The&#10;happy little one was to be welcomed with rejoicing, to be cared for&#10;with love and tenderness, and enjoy every advantage of wealth and&#10;luxury that a rich and influential family can give. So the days&#10;went by like a joyous festival.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Life is a gracious gift from God, almost too great a gift&#10;for us to appreciate!&#34; said the young wife. &#34;Yet they say that&#10;fulness of joy for ever and ever can only be found in the future&#10;life. I cannot realise it!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The thought arises, perhaps, from the arrogance of men,&#34;&#10;said the husband. &#34;It seems a great pride to believe that we shall&#10;live for ever, that we shall be as gods! Were not these the words&#10;of the serpent, the father of lies?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Surely you do not doubt the existence of a future life?&#34;&#10;exclaimed the young wife. It seemed as if one of the first shadows&#10;passed over her sunny thoughts.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Faith realises it, and the priests tell us so,&#34; replied&#10;her husband; &#34;but amid all my happiness I feel that it is arrogant&#10;to demand a continuation of it&#8212;another life after this. Has not so&#10;much been given us in this world that we ought to be, we must be,&#10;contented with it?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, it has been given to us,&#34; said the young wife, &#34;but&#10;this life is nothing more than one long scene of trial and hardship&#10;to many thousands. How many have been cast into this world only to&#10;endure poverty, shame, illness, and misfortune? If there were no&#10;future life, everything here would be too unequally divided, and&#10;God would not be the personification of justice.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The beggar there,&#34; said her husband, &#34;has joys of his own&#10;which seem to him great, and cause him as much pleasure as a king&#10;would find in the magnificence of his palace. And then do you not&#10;think that the beast of burden, which suffers blows and hunger, and&#10;works itself to death, suffers just as much from its miserable&#10;fate? The dumb creature might demand a future life also, and&#10;declare the law unjust that excludes it from the advantages of the&#10;higher creation.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Christ said: &#39;In my father&#39;s house are many mansions,&#39;&#34;&#10;she answered. &#34;Heaven is as boundless as the love of our Creator;&#10;the dumb animal is also His creature, and I firmly believe that no&#10;life will be lost, but each will receive as much happiness as he&#10;can enjoy, which will be sufficient for him.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;This world is sufficient for me,&#34; said the husband,&#10;throwing his arm round his beautiful, sweet-tempered wife. He sat&#10;by her side on the open balcony, smoking a cigarette in the cool&#10;air, which was loaded with the sweet scent of carnations and orange&#10;blossoms. Sounds of music and the clatter of castanets came from&#10;the road beneath, the stars shone above then, and two eyes full of&#10;affection&#8212;those of his wife&#8212;looked upon him with the expression of&#10;undying love. &#34;Such a moment,&#34; he said, &#34;makes it worth while to be&#10;born, to die, and to be annihilated!&#34; He smiled&#8212;the young wife&#10;raised her hand in gentle reproof, and the shadow passed away from&#10;her mind, and they were happy&#8212;quite happy.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Everything seemed to work together for their good. They&#10;advanced in honour, in prosperity, and in happiness. A change came&#10;certainly, but it was only a change of place and not of&#10;circumstances.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The young man was sent by his Sovereign as ambassador to&#10;the Russian Court. This was an office of high dignity, but his&#10;birth and his acquirements entitled him to the honour. He possessed&#10;a large fortune, and his wife had brought him wealth equal to his&#10;own, for she was the daughter of a rich and respected merchant. One&#10;of this merchant&#39;s largest and finest ships was to be sent that&#10;year to Stockholm, and it was arranged that the dear young couple,&#10;the daughter and the son-in-law, should travel in it to St.&#10;Petersburg. All the arrangements on board were princely and silk&#10;and luxury on every side.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In an old war song, called &#34;The King of England&#39;s Son,&#34; it&#10;says:&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Farewell, he said, and sailed away.&#60;br /&#62;&#10;And many recollect that day.&#60;br /&#62;&#10;The ropes were of silk, the anchor of gold,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;And everywhere riches and wealth untold.&#34;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;These words would aptly describe the vessel from Spain,&#10;for here was the same luxury, and the same parting thought&#10;naturally arose:&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;God grant that we once more may meet&#60;br /&#62;&#10;In sweet unclouded peace and joy.&#34;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;There was a favourable wind blowing as they left the&#10;Spanish coast, and it would be but a short journey, for they hoped&#10;to reach their destination in a few weeks; but when they came out&#10;upon the wide ocean the wind dropped, the sea became smooth and&#10;shining, and the stars shone brightly. Many festive evenings were&#10;spent on board. At last the travellers began to wish for wind, for&#10;a favourable breeze; but their wish was useless&#8212;not a breath of air&#10;stirred, or if it did arise it was contrary. Weeks passed by in&#10;this way, two whole months, and then at length a fair wind blew&#10;from the south-west. The ship sailed on the high seas between&#10;Scotland and Jutland; then the wind increased, just as it did in&#10;the old song of &#34;The King of England&#39;s Son.&#34;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;Mid storm and wind, and pelting hail,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Their efforts were of no avail.&#60;br /&#62;&#10;The golden anchor forth they threw;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Towards Denmark the west wind blew.&#34;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;This all happened a long time ago; King Christian VII, who&#10;sat on the Danish throne, was still a young man. Much has happened&#10;since then, much has altered or been changed. Sea and moorland have&#10;been turned into green meadows, stretches of heather have become&#10;arable land, and in the shelter of the peasant&#39;s cottages,&#10;apple-trees and rose-bushes grow, though they certainly require&#10;much care, as the sharp west wind blows upon them. In West Jutland&#10;one may go back in thought to old times, farther back than the days&#10;when Christian VII ruled. The purple heather still extends for&#10;miles, with its barrows and aerial spectacles, intersected with&#10;sandy uneven roads, just as it did then; towards the west, where&#10;broad streams run into the bays, are marshes and meadows encircled&#10;by lofty, sandy hills, which, like a chain of Alps, raise their&#10;pointed summits near the sea; they are only broken by high ridges&#10;of clay, from which the sea, year by year, bites out great&#10;mouthfuls, so that the overhanging banks fall down as if by the&#10;shock of an earthquake. Thus it is there today and thus it was long&#10;ago, when the happy pair were sailing in the beautiful&#10;ship.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was a Sunday, towards the end of September; the sun was&#10;shining, and the chiming of the church bells in the Bay of Nissum&#10;was carried along by the breeze like a chain of sounds. The&#10;churches there are almost entirely built of hewn blocks of stone,&#10;each like a piece of rock. The North Sea might foam over them and&#10;they would not be disturbed. Nearly all of them are without&#10;steeples, and the bells are hung outside between two beams. The&#10;service was over, and the congregation passed out into the&#10;churchyard, where not a tree or bush was to be seen; no flowers&#10;were planted there, and they had not placed a single wreath upon&#10;any of the graves. It is just the same now. Rough mounds show where&#10;the dead have been buried, and rank grass, tossed by the wind,&#10;grows thickly over the whole churchyard; here and there a grave has&#10;a sort of monument, a block of half-decayed wood, rudely cut in the&#10;shape of a coffin; the blocks are brought from the forest of West&#10;Jutland, but the forest is the sea itself, and the inhabitants find&#10;beams, and planks, and fragments which the waves have cast upon the&#10;beach. One of these blocks had been placed by loving hands on a&#10;child&#39;s grave, and one of the women who had come out of the church&#10;walked up to it; she stood there, her eyes resting on the&#10;weather-beaten memorial, and a few moments afterwards her husband&#10;joined her. They were both silent, but he took her hand, and they&#10;walked together across the purple heath, over moor and meadow&#10;towards the sandhills. For a long time they went on without&#10;speaking.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It was a good sermon to-day,&#34; the man said at last. &#34;If&#10;we had not God to trust in, we should have nothing.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes,&#34; replied the woman, &#34;He sends joy and sorrow, and He&#10;has a right to send them. To-morrow our little son would have been&#10;five years old if we had been permitted to keep him.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It is no use fretting, wife,&#34; said the man. &#34;The boy is&#10;well provided for. He is where we hope and pray to go&#10;to.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;They said nothing more, but went out towards their houses&#10;among the sand-hills. All at once, in front of one of the houses&#10;where the sea grass did not keep the sand down with its twining&#10;roots, what seemed to be a column of smoke rose up. A gust of wind&#10;rushed between the hills, hurling the particles of sand high into&#10;the air; another gust, and the strings of fish hung up to dry&#10;flapped and beat violently against the walls of the cottage; then&#10;everything was quiet once more, and the sun shone with renewed&#10;heat.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The man and his wife went into the cottage. They had soon&#10;taken off their Sunday clothes and come out again, hurrying over&#10;the dunes which stood there like great waves of sand suddenly&#10;arrested in their course, while the sandweeds and dune grass with&#10;its bluish stalks spread a changing colour over them. A few&#10;neighbours also came out, and helped each other to draw the boats&#10;higher up on the beach. The wind now blew more keenly, it was&#10;chilly and cold, and when they went back over the sand-hills, sand&#10;and little sharp stones blew into their faces. The waves rose high,&#10;crested with white foam, and the wind cut off their crests,&#10;scattering the foam far and wide.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Evening came; there was a swelling roar in the air, a&#10;wailing or moaning like the voices of despairing spirits, that&#10;sounded above the thunder of the waves. The fisherman&#39;s little&#10;cottage was on the very margin, and the sand rattled against the&#10;window panes; every now and then a violent gust of wind shook the&#10;house to its foundation. It was dark, but about midnight the moon&#10;would rise. Later on the air became clearer, but the storm swept&#10;over the perturbed sea with undiminished fury; the fisher folks had&#10;long since gone to bed, but in such weather there was no chance of&#10;closing an eye. Presently there was a tapping at the window; the&#10;door was opened, and a voice said:&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;There&#39;s a large ship stranded on the farthest&#10;reef.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In a moment the fisher people sprung from their beds and&#10;hastily dressed themselves. The moon had risen, and it was light&#10;enough to make the surrounding objects visible to those who could&#10;open their eyes in the blinding clouds of sand; the violence of the&#10;wind was terrible, and it was only possible to pass among the&#10;sand-hills if one crept forward between the gusts; the salt spray&#10;flew up from the sea like down, and the ocean foamed like a roaring&#10;cataract towards the beach. Only a practised eye could discern the&#10;vessel out in the offing; she was a fine brig, and the waves now&#10;lifted her over the reef, three or four cables&#39; length out of the&#10;usual channel. She drove towards the shore, struck on the second&#10;reef, and remained fixed.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was impossible to render assistance; the sea rushed in&#10;upon the vessel, making a clean breach over her. Those on shore&#10;thought they heard cries for help from those on board, and could&#10;plainly distinguish the busy but useless efforts made by the&#10;stranded sailors. Now a wave came rolling onward. It fell with&#10;enormous force on the bowsprit, tearing it from the vessel, and the&#10;stern was lifted high above the water. Two people were seen to&#10;embrace and plunge together into the sea, and the next moment one&#10;of the largest waves that rolled towards the sand-hills threw a&#10;body on the beach. It was a woman; the sailors said that she was&#10;quite dead, but the women thought they saw signs of life in her, so&#10;the stranger was carried across the sand-hills to the fisherman&#39;s&#10;cottage. How beautiful and fair she was! She must be a great lady,&#10;they said.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;They laid her upon the humble bed; there was not a yard of&#10;linen on it, only a woollen coverlet to keep the occupant&#10;warm.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Life returned to her, but she was delirious, and knew&#10;nothing of what had happened or where she was; and it was better&#10;so, for everything she loved and valued lay buried in the sea. The&#10;same thing happened to her ship as to the one spoken of in the song&#10;about &#34;The King of England&#39;s Son.&#34;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Alas! how terrible to see&#60;br /&#62;&#10;The gallant bark sink rapidly.&#34;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Fragments of the wreck and pieces of wood were washed&#10;ashore; they were all that remained of the vessel. The wind still&#10;blew violently on the coast.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;For a few moments the strange lady seemed to rest; but she&#10;awoke in pain, and uttered cries of anguish and fear. She opened&#10;her wonderfully beautiful eyes, and spoke a few words, but nobody&#10;understood her.&#8212;And lo! as a reward for the sorrow and suffering&#10;she had undergone, she held in her arms a new-born babe. The child&#10;that was to have rested upon a magnificent couch, draped with&#10;silken curtains, in a luxurious home; it was to have been welcomed&#10;with joy to a life rich in all the good things of this world; and&#10;now Heaven had ordained that it should be born in this humble&#10;retreat, that it should not even receive a kiss from its mother,&#10;for when the fisherman&#39;s wife laid the child upon the mother&#39;s&#10;bosom, it rested on a heart that beat no more&#8212;she was&#10;dead.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The child that was to have been reared amid wealth and&#10;luxury was cast into the world, washed by the sea among the&#10;sand-hills to share the fate and hardships of the poor.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Here we are reminded again of the song about &#34;The King of&#10;England&#39;s Son,&#34; for in it mention is made of the custom prevalent&#10;at the time, when knights and squires plundered those who had been&#10;saved from shipwreck. The ship had stranded some distance south of&#10;Nissum Bay, and the cruel, inhuman days, when, as we have just&#10;said, the inhabitants of Jutland treated the shipwrecked people so&#10;crudely were past, long ago. Affectionate sympathy and&#10;self-sacrifice for the unfortunate existed then, just as it does in&#10;our own time in many a bright example. The dying mother and the&#10;unfortunate child would have found kindness and help wherever they&#10;had been cast by the winds, but nowhere would it have been more&#10;sincere than in the cottage of the poor fisherman&#39;s wife, who had&#10;stood, only the day before, beside her child&#39;s grave, who would&#10;have been five years old that day if God had spared it to&#10;her.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;No one knew who the dead stranger was, they could not even&#10;form a conjecture; the fragments of wreckage gave no clue to the&#10;matter.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;No tidings reached Spain of the fate of the daughter and&#10;son-in-law. They did not arrive at their destination, and violent&#10;storms had raged during the past weeks. At last the verdict was&#10;given: &#34;Foundered at sea&#8212;all lost.&#34; But in the fisherman&#39;s cottage&#10;among the sand-hills near Hunsby, there lived a little scion of the&#10;rich Spanish family.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Where Heaven sends food for two, a third can manage to&#10;find a meal, and in the depth of the sea there is many a dish of&#10;fish for the hungry.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;They called the boy Jurgen.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It must certainly be a Jewish child, its skin is so&#10;dark,&#34; the people said.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It might be an Italian or a Spaniard,&#34; remarked the&#10;clergyman.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But to the fisherman&#39;s wife these nations seemed all the&#10;same, and she consoled herself with the thought that the child was&#10;baptized as a Christian.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The boy throve; the noble blood in his veins was warm, and&#10;he became strong on his homely fare. He grew apace in the humble&#10;cottage, and the Danish dialect spoken by the West Jutes became his&#10;language. The pomegranate seed from Spain became a hardy plant on&#10;the coast of West Jutland. Thus may circumstances alter the course&#10;of a man&#39;s life! To this home he clung with deep-rooted affection;&#10;he was to experience cold and hunger, and the misfortunes and&#10;hardships that surround the poor; but he also tasted of their&#10;joys.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Childhood has bright days for every one, and the memory of&#10;them shines through the whole after-life. The boy had many sources&#10;of pleasure and enjoyment; the coast for miles and miles was full&#10;of playthings, for it was a mosaic of pebbles, some red as coral or&#10;yellow as amber, and others again white and rounded like birds&#39;&#10;eggs and smoothed and prepared by the sea. Even the bleached&#10;fishes&#39; skeletons, the water plants dried by the wind, and seaweed,&#10;white and shining long linen-like bands waving between the&#10;stones&#8212;all these seemed made to give pleasure and occupation for&#10;the boy&#39;s thoughts, and he had an intelligent mind; many great&#10;talents lay dormant in him. How readily he remembered stories and&#10;songs that he heard, and how dexterous he was with his fingers!&#10;With stones and mussel-shells he could put together pictures and&#10;ships with which one could decorate the room; and he could make&#10;wonderful things from a stick, his foster-mother said, although he&#10;was still so young and little. He had a sweet voice, and every&#10;melody seemed to flow naturally from his lips. And in his heart&#10;were hidden chords, which might have sounded far out into the world&#10;if he had been placed anywhere else than in the fisherman&#39;s hut by&#10;the North Sea.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;One day another ship was wrecked on the coast, and among&#10;other things a chest filled with valuable flower bulbs was washed&#10;ashore. Some were put into saucepans and cooked, for they were&#10;thought to be fit to eat, and others lay and shrivelled in the&#10;sand&#8212;they did not accomplish their purpose, or unfold their&#10;magnificent colours. Would Jurgen fare better? The flower bulbs had&#10;soon played their part, but he had years of apprenticeship before&#10;him. Neither he nor his friends noticed in what a monotonous,&#10;uniform way one day followed another, for there was always plenty&#10;to do and see. The ocean itself was a great lesson-book, and it&#10;unfolded a new leaf each day of calm or storm&#8212;the crested wave or&#10;the smooth surface.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The visits to the church were festive occasions, but among&#10;the fisherman&#39;s house one was especially looked forward to; this&#10;was, in fact, the visit of the brother of Jurgen&#39;s foster-mother,&#10;the eel-breeder from Fjaltring, near Bovbjerg. He came twice a year&#10;in a cart, painted red with blue and white tulips upon it, and full&#10;of eels; it was covered and locked like a box, two dun oxen drew&#10;it, and Jurgen was allowed to guide them.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The eel-breeder was a witty fellow, a merry guest, and&#10;brought a measure of brandy with him. They all received a small&#10;glassful or a cupful if there were not enough glasses; even Jurgen&#10;had about a thimbleful, that he might digest the fat eel, as the&#10;eel-breeder said; he always told one story over and over again, and&#10;if his hearers laughed he would immediately repeat it to them.&#10;Jurgen while still a boy, and also when he was older, used phrases&#10;from the eel-breeder&#39;s story on various occasions, so it will be as&#10;well for us to listen to it. It runs thus:&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The eels went into the bay, and the young ones begged&#10;leave to go a little farther out. &#39;Don&#39;t go too far,&#39; said their&#10;mother; &#39;the ugly eel-spearer might come and snap you all up.&#39; But&#10;they went too far, and of eight daughters only three came back to&#10;the mother, and these wept and said, &#39;We only went a little way&#10;out, and the ugly eel-spearer came immediately and stabbed five of&#10;our sisters to death.&#39; &#39;They&#39;ll come back again,&#39; said the mother&#10;eel. &#39;Oh, no,&#39; exclaimed the daughters, &#39;for he skinned them, cut&#10;them in two, and fried them.&#39; &#39;Oh, they&#39;ll come back again,&#39; the&#10;mother eel persisted. &#39;No,&#39; replied the daughters, &#39;for he ate them&#10;up.&#39; &#39;They&#39;ll come back again,&#39; repeated the mother eel. &#39;But he&#10;drank brandy after them,&#39; said the daughters. &#39;Ah, then they&#39;ll&#10;never come back,&#39; said the mother, and she burst out crying, &#39;it&#39;s&#10;the brandy that buries the eels.&#39;&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And therefore,&#34; said the eel-breeder in conclusion, &#34;it&#10;is always the proper thing to drink brandy after eating&#10;eels.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;This story was the tinsel thread, the most humorous&#10;recollection of Jurgen&#39;s life. He also wanted to go a little way&#10;farther out and up the bay&#8212;that is to say, out into the world in a&#10;ship&#8212;but his mother said, like the eel-breeder, &#34;There are so many&#10;bad people&#8212;eel spearers!&#34; He wished to go a little way past the&#10;sand-hills, out into the dunes, and at last he did: four happy&#10;days, the brightest of his childhood, fell to his lot, and the&#10;whole beauty and splendour of Jutland, all the happiness and&#10;sunshine of his home, were concentrated in these. He went to a&#10;festival, but it was a burial feast.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A rich relation of the fisherman&#39;s family had died; the&#10;farm was situated far eastward in the country and a little towards&#10;the north. Jurgen&#39;s foster parents went there, and he also went&#10;with them from the dunes, over heath and moor, where the Skjaerumaa&#10;takes its course through green meadows and contains many eels;&#10;mother eels live there with their daughters, who are caught and&#10;eaten up by wicked people. But do not men sometimes act quite as&#10;cruelly towards their own fellow-men? Was not the knight Sir Bugge&#10;murdered by wicked people? And though he was well spoken of, did he&#10;not also wish to kill the architect who built the castle for him,&#10;with its thick walls and tower, at the point where the Skjaerumaa&#10;falls into the bay? Jurgen and his parents now stood there; the&#10;wall and the ramparts still remained, and red crumbling fragments&#10;lay scattered around. Here it was that Sir Bugge, after the&#10;architect had left him, said to one of his men, &#34;Go after him and&#10;say, &#39;Master, the tower shakes.&#39; If he turns round, kill him and&#10;take away the money I paid him, but if he does not turn round let&#10;him go in peace.&#34; The man did as he was told; the architect did not&#10;turn round, but called back &#34;The tower does not shake in the least,&#10;but one day a man will come from the west in a blue cloak&#8212;he will&#10;cause it to shake!&#34; And so indeed it happened a hundred years&#10;later, for the North Sea broke in and cast down the tower; but&#10;Predbjorn Gyldenstjerne, the man who then possessed the castle,&#10;built a new castle higher up at the end of the meadow, and that one&#10;is standing to this day, and is called Norre-Vosborg.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Jurgen and his foster parents went past this castle. They&#10;had told him its story during the long winter evenings, and now he&#10;saw the stately edifice, with its double moat, and trees and&#10;bushes; the wall, covered with ferns, rose within the moat, but the&#10;lofty lime-trees were the most beautiful of all; they grew up to&#10;the highest windows, and the air was full of their sweet fragrance.&#10;In a north-west corner of the garden stood a great bush full of&#10;blossom, like winter snow amid the summer&#39;s green; it was a juniper&#10;bush, the first that Jurgen had ever seen in bloom. He never forgot&#10;it, nor the lime-trees; the child&#39;s soul treasured up these&#10;memories of beauty and fragrance to gladden the old man.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;From Norre-Vosborg, where the juniper blossomed, the&#10;journey became more pleasant, for they met some other people who&#10;were also going to the funeral and were riding in waggons. Our&#10;travellers had to sit all together on a little box at the back of&#10;the waggon, but even this, they thought, was better than walking.&#10;So they continued their journey across the rugged heath. The oxen&#10;which drew the waggon stopped every now and then, where a patch of&#10;fresh grass appeared amid the heather. The sun shone with&#10;considerable heat, and it was wonderful to behold how in the far&#10;distance something like smoke seemed to be rising; yet this smoke&#10;was clearer than the air; it was transparent, and looked like rays&#10;of light rolling and dancing afar over the heath.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That is Lokeman driving his sheep,&#34; said some&#10;one.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And this was enough to excite Jurgen&#39;s imagination. He&#10;felt as if they were now about to enter fairyland, though&#10;everything was still real. How quiet it was! The heath stretched&#10;far and wide around them like a beautiful carpet. The heather was&#10;in blossom, and the juniper-bushes and fresh oak saplings rose like&#10;bouquets from the earth. An inviting place for a frolic, if it had&#10;not been for the number of poisonous adders of which the travellers&#10;spoke; they also mentioned that the place had formerly been&#10;infested with wolves, and that the district was still called&#10;Wolfsborg for this reason. The old man who was driving the oxen&#10;told them that in the lifetime of his father the horses had many a&#10;hard battle with the wild beasts that were now exterminated. One&#10;morning, when he himself had gone out to bring in the horses, he&#10;found one of them standing with its forefeet on a wolf it had&#10;killed, but the savage animal had torn and lacerated the brave&#10;horse&#39;s legs.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The journey over the heath and the deep sand was only too&#10;quickly at an end. They stopped before the house of mourning, where&#10;they found plenty of guests within and without. Waggon after waggon&#10;stood side by side, while the horses and oxen had been turned out&#10;to graze on the scanty pasture. Great sand-hills like those at home&#10;by the North Sea rose behind the house and extended far and wide.&#10;How had they come here, so many miles inland? They were as large&#10;and high as those on the coast, and the wind had carried them&#10;there; there was also a legend attached to them.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Psalms were sung, and a few of the old people shed tears;&#10;with this exception, the guests were cheerful enough, it seemed to&#10;Jurgen, and there was plenty to eat and drink. There were eels of&#10;the fattest, requiring brandy to bury them, as the eel-breeder&#10;said; and certainly they did not forget to carry out his maxim&#10;here.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Jurgen went in and out the house; and on the third day he&#10;felt as much at home as he did in the fisherman&#39;s cottage among the&#10;sand-hills, where he had passed his early days. Here on the heath&#10;were riches unknown to him until now; for flowers, blackberries,&#10;and bilberries were to be found in profusion, so large and sweet&#10;that when they were crushed beneath the tread of passers-by the&#10;heather was stained with their red juice. Here was a barrow and&#10;yonder another. Then columns of smoke rose into the still air; it&#10;was a heath fire, they told him&#8212;how brightly it blazed in the dark&#10;evening!&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The fourth day came, and the funeral festivities were at&#10;an end; they were to go back from the land-dunes to the&#10;sand-dunes.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ours are better,&#34; said the old fisherman, Jurgen&#39;s&#10;foster-father; &#34;these have no strength.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And they spoke of the way in which the sand-dunes had come&#10;inland, and it seemed very easy to understand. This is how they&#10;explained it:&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A dead body had been found on the coast, and the peasants&#10;buried it in the churchyard. From that time the sand began to fly&#10;about and the sea broke in with violence. A wise man in the&#10;district advised them to open the grave and see if the buried man&#10;was not lying sucking his thumb, for if so he must be a sailor, and&#10;the sea would not rest until it had got him back. The grave was&#10;opened, and he really was found with his thumb in his mouth. So&#10;they laid him upon a cart, and harnessed two oxen to it; and the&#10;oxen ran off with the sailor over heath and moor to the ocean, as&#10;if they had been stung by an adder. Then the sand ceased to fly&#10;inland, but the hills that had been piled up still&#10;remained.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;All this Jurgen listened to and treasured up in his memory&#10;of the happiest days of his childhood&#8212;the days of the burial&#10;feast.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;How delightful it was to see fresh places and to mix with&#10;strangers! And he was to go still farther, for he was not yet&#10;fourteen years old when he went out in a ship to see the world. He&#10;encountered bad weather, heavy seas, unkindness, and hard men&#8212;such&#10;were his experiences, for he became ship-boy. Cold nights, bad&#10;living, and blows had to be endured; then he felt his noble Spanish&#10;blood boil within him, and bitter, angry, words rose to his lips,&#10;but he gulped them down; it was better, although he felt as the eel&#10;must feel when it is skinned, cut up, and put into the&#10;frying-pan.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I shall get over it,&#34; said a voice within him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;He saw the Spanish coast, the native land of his parents.&#10;He even saw the town where they had lived in joy and prosperity,&#10;but he knew nothing of his home or his relations, and his relations&#10;knew just as little about him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The poor ship boy was not permitted to land, but on the&#10;last day of their stay he managed to get ashore. There were several&#10;purchases to be made, and he was sent to carry them on&#10;board.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Jurgen stood there in his shabby clothes which looked as&#10;if they had been washed in the ditch and dried in the chimney; he,&#10;who had always dwelt among the sand-hills, now saw a great city for&#10;the first time. How lofty the houses seemed, and what a number of&#10;people there were in the streets! some pushing this way, some&#10;that&#8212;a perfect maelstrom of citizens and peasants, monks and&#10;soldiers&#8212;the jingling of bells on the trappings of asses and mules,&#10;the chiming of church bells, calling, shouting, hammering and&#10;knocking&#8212;all going on at once. Every trade was located in the&#10;basement of the houses or in the side thoroughfares; and the sun&#10;shone with such heat, and the air was so close, that one seemed to&#10;be in an oven full of beetles, cockchafers, bees and flies, all&#10;humming and buzzing together. Jurgen scarcely knew where he was or&#10;which way he went. Then he saw just in front of him the great&#10;doorway of a cathedral; the lights were gleaming in the dark&#10;aisles, and the fragrance of incense was wafted towards him. Even&#10;the poorest beggar ventured up the steps into the sanctuary. Jurgen&#10;followed the sailor he was with into the church, and stood in the&#10;sacred edifice. Coloured pictures gleamed from their golden&#10;background, and on the altar stood the figure of the Virgin with&#10;the child Jesus, surrounded by lights and flowers; priests in&#10;festive robes were chanting, and choir boys in dazzling attire&#10;swung silver censers. What splendour and magnificence he saw there!&#10;It streamed in upon his soul and overpowered him: the church and&#10;the faith of his parents surrounded him, and touched a chord in his&#10;heart that caused his eyes to overflow with tears.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;They went from the church to the market-place. Here a&#10;quantity of provisions were given him to carry. The way to the&#10;harbour was long; and weary and overcome with various emotions, he&#10;rested for a few moments before a splendid house, with marble&#10;pillars, statues, and broad steps. Here he rested his burden&#10;against the wall. Then a porter in livery came out, lifted up a&#10;silver-headed cane, and drove him away&#8212;him, the grandson of that&#10;house. But no one knew that, and he just as little as any one. Then&#10;he went on board again, and once more encountered rough words and&#10;blows, much work and little sleep&#8212;such was his experience of life.&#10;They say it is good to suffer in one&#39;s young days, if age brings&#10;something to make up for it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;His period of service on board the ship came to an end,&#10;and the vessel lay once more at Ringkjobing in Jutland. He came&#10;ashore, and went home to the sand-dunes near Hunsby; but his&#10;foster-mother had died during his absence.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A hard winter followed this summer. Snow-storms swept over&#10;land and sea, and there was difficulty in getting from one place to&#10;another. How unequally things are distributed in this world! Here&#10;there was bitter cold and snow-storms, while in Spain there was&#10;burning sunshine and oppressive heat. Yet, when a clear frosty day&#10;came, and Jurgen saw the swans flying in numbers from the sea&#10;towards the land, across to Norre-Vosborg, it seemed to him that&#10;people could breathe more freely here; the summer also in this part&#10;of the world was splendid. In imagination he saw the heath blossom&#10;and become purple with rich juicy berries, and the elder-bushes and&#10;lime-trees at Norre Vosborg in flower. He made up his mind to go&#10;there again.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Spring came, and the fishing began. Jurgen was now an&#10;active helper in this, for he had grown during the last year, and&#10;was quick at work. He was full of life, and knew how to swim, to&#10;tread water, and to turn over and tumble in the strong tide. They&#10;often warned him to beware of the sharks, which seize the best&#10;swimmer, draw him down, and devour him; but such was not to be&#10;Jurgen&#39;s fate.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;At a neighbour&#39;s house in the dunes there was a boy named&#10;Martin, with whom Jurgen was on very friendly terms, and they both&#10;took service in the same ship to Norway, and also went together to&#10;Holland. They never had a quarrel, but a person can be easily&#10;excited to quarrel when he is naturally hot tempered, for he often&#10;shows it in many ways; and this is just what Jurgen did one day&#10;when they fell out about the merest trifle. They were sitting&#10;behind the cabin door, eating from a delft plate, which they had&#10;placed between them. Jurgen held his pocket-knife in his hand and&#10;raised it towards Martin, and at the same time became ashy pale,&#10;and his eyes had an ugly look. Martin only said, &#34;Ah! ah! you are&#10;one of that sort, are you? Fond of using the knife!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The words were scarcely spoken, when Jurgen&#39;s hand sank&#10;down. He did not answer a syllable, but went on eating, and&#10;afterwards returned to his work. When they were resting again he&#10;walked up to Martin and said:&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Hit me in the face! I deserve it. But sometimes I feel as&#10;if I had a pot in me that boils over.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;There, let the thing rest,&#34; replied Martin.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And after that they were almost better friends than ever;&#10;when afterwards they returned to the dunes and began telling their&#10;adventures, this was told among the rest. Martin said that Jurgen&#10;was certainly passionate, but a good fellow after all.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;They were both young and healthy, well-grown and strong;&#10;but Jurgen was the cleverer of the two.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In Norway the peasants go into the mountains and take the&#10;cattle there to find pasture. On the west coast of Jutland huts&#10;have been erected among the sand-hills; they are built of pieces of&#10;wreck, and thatched with turf and heather; there are sleeping&#10;places round the walls, and here the fishermen live and sleep&#10;during the early spring. Every fisherman has a female helper, or&#10;manager as she is called, who baits his hooks, prepares warm beer&#10;for him when he comes ashore, and gets the dinner cooked and ready&#10;for him by the time he comes back to the hut tired and hungry.&#10;Besides this the managers bring up the fish from the boats, cut&#10;them open, prepare them, and have generally a great deal to&#10;do.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Jurgen, his father, and several other fishermen and their&#10;managers inhabited the same hut; Martin lived in the next&#10;one.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;One of the girls, whose name was Else, had known Jurgen&#10;from childhood; they were glad to see each other, and were of the&#10;same opinion on many points, but in appearance they were entirely&#10;opposite; for he was dark, and she was pale, and fair, and had&#10;flaxen hair, and eyes as blue as the sea in sunshine.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;As they were walking together one day, Jurgen held her&#10;hand very firmly in his, and she said to him: &#34;Jurgen, I have&#10;something I want to say to you; let me be your manager, for you are&#10;like a brother to me; but Martin, whose housekeeper I am&#8212;he is my&#10;lover&#8212;but you need not tell this to the others.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It seemed to Jurgen as if the loose sand was giving way&#10;under his feet. He did not speak a word, but nodded his head, and&#10;that meant &#34;yes.&#34; It was all that was necessary; but he suddenly&#10;felt in his heart that he hated Martin, and the more he thought the&#10;more he felt convinced that Martin had stolen away from him the&#10;only being he ever loved, and that this was Else: he had never&#10;thought of Else in this way before, but now it all became plain to&#10;him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;When the sea is rather rough, and the fishermen are coming&#10;home in their great boats, it is wonderful to see how they cross&#10;the reefs. One of them stands upright in the bow of the boat, and&#10;the others watch him sitting with the oars in their hands. Outside&#10;the reef it looks as if the boat was not approaching land but going&#10;back to sea; then the man who is standing up gives them the signal&#10;that the great wave is coming which is to float them across the&#10;reef. The boat is lifted high into the air, so that the keel is&#10;seen from the shore; the next moment nothing can be seen, mast,&#10;keel, and people are all hidden&#8212;it seems as though the sea had&#10;devoured them; but in a few moments they emerge like a great sea&#10;animal climbing up the waves, and the oars move as if the creature&#10;had legs. The second and third reef are passed in the same manner;&#10;then the fishermen jump into the water and push the boat towards&#10;the shore&#8212;every wave helps them&#8212;and at length they have it drawn&#10;up, beyond the reach of the breakers.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A wrong order given in front of the reef&#8212;the slightest&#10;hesitation&#8212;and the boat would be lost,&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Then it would be all over with me and Martin&#10;too!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;This thought passed through Jurgen&#39;s mind one day while&#10;they were out at sea, where his foster-father had been taken&#10;suddenly ill. The fever had seized him. They were only a few oars&#39;&#10;strokes from the reef, and Jurgen sprang from his seat and stood up&#10;in the bow.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Father-let me come!&#34; he said, and he glanced at Martin&#10;and across the waves; every oar bent with the exertions of the&#10;rowers as the great wave came towards them, and he saw his father&#39;s&#10;pale face, and dared not obey the evil impulse that had shot&#10;through his brain. The boat came safely across the reef to land;&#10;but the evil thought remained in his heart, and roused up every&#10;little fibre of bitterness which he remembered between himself and&#10;Martin since they had known each other. But he could not weave the&#10;fibres together, nor did he endeavour to do so. He felt that Martin&#10;had robbed him, and this was enough to make him hate his former&#10;friend. Several of the fishermen saw this, but Martin did not&#8212;he&#10;remained as obliging and talkative as ever, in fact he talked&#10;rather too much.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Jurgen&#39;s foster-father took to his bed, and it became his&#10;death-bed, for he died a week afterwards; and now Jurgen was heir&#10;to the little house behind the sand-hills. It was small, certainly,&#10;but still it was something, and Martin had nothing of the&#10;kind.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You will not go to sea again, Jurgen, I suppose,&#34;&#10;observed one of the old fishermen. &#34;You will always stay with us&#10;now.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But this was not Jurgen&#39;s intention; he wanted to see&#10;something of the world. The eel-breeder of Fjaltring had an uncle&#10;at Old Skjagen, who was a fisherman, but also a prosperous merchant&#10;with ships upon the sea; he was said to be a good old man, and it&#10;would not be a bad thing to enter his service. Old Skjagen lies in&#10;the extreme north of Jutland, as far away from the Hunsby dunes as&#10;one can travel in that country; and this is just what pleased&#10;Jurgen, for he did not want to remain till the wedding of Martin&#10;and Else, which would take place in a week or two.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The old fisherman said it was foolish to go away, for now&#10;that Jurgen had a home Else would very likely be inclined to take&#10;him instead of Martin.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Jurgen gave such a vague answer that it was not easy to&#10;make out what he meant&#8212;the old man brought Else to him, and she&#10;said:&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You have a home now; you ought to think of&#10;that.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And Jurgen thought of many things.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The sea has heavy waves, but there are heavier waves in&#10;the human heart. Many thoughts, strong and weak, rushed through&#10;Jurgen&#39;s brain, and he said to Else:&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;If Martin had a house like mine, which of us would you&#10;rather have?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But Martin has no house and cannot get one.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Suppose he had one?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Well, then I would certainly take Martin, for that is&#10;what my heart tells me; but one cannot live upon love.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Jurgen turned these things over in his mind all night.&#10;Something was working within him, he hardly knew what it was, but&#10;it was even stronger than his love for Else; and so he went to&#10;Martin&#39;s, and what he said and did there was well considered. He&#10;let the house to Martin on most liberal terms, saying that he&#10;wished to go to sea again, because he loved it. And Else kissed him&#10;when she heard of it, for she loved Martin best.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Jurgen proposed to start early in the morning, and on the&#10;evening before his departure, when it was already getting rather&#10;late, he felt a wish to visit Martin once more. He started, and&#10;among the dunes met the old fisherman, who was angry at his leaving&#10;the place. The old man made jokes about Martin, and declared there&#10;must be some magic about that fellow, of whom the girls were so&#10;fond.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Jurgen did not pay any attention to his remarks, but said&#10;good-bye to the old man and went on towards the house where Martin&#10;dwelt. He heard loud talking inside; Martin was not alone, and this&#10;made Jurgen waver in his determination, for he did not wish to see&#10;Else again. On second thoughts, he decided that it was better not&#10;to hear any more thanks from Martin, and so he turned&#10;back.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;On the following morning, before the sun rose, he fastened&#10;his knapsack on his back, took his wooden provision box in his&#10;hand, and went away among the sand-hills towards the coast path.&#10;This way was more pleasant than the heavy sand road, and besides it&#10;was shorter; and he intended to go first to Fjaltring, near&#10;Bovbjerg, where the eel-breeder lived, to whom he had promised a&#10;visit.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The sea lay before him, clear and blue, and the mussel&#10;shells and pebbles, the playthings of his childhood, crunched over&#10;his feet. While he thus walked on his nose suddenly began to bleed;&#10;it was a trifling occurrence, but trifles sometimes are of great&#10;importance. A few large drops of blood fell upon one of his&#10;sleeves. He wiped them off and stopped the bleeding, and it seemed&#10;to him as if this had cleared and lightened his brain. The sea-cale&#10;bloomed here and there in the sand as he passed. He broke off a&#10;spray and stuck it in his hat; he determined to be merry and&#10;light-hearted, for he was going out into the wide world&#8212;&#34;a little&#10;way out, beyond the bay,&#34; as the young eels had said. &#34;Beware of&#10;bad people who will catch you, and skin you, and put you in the&#10;frying-pan!&#34; he repeated in his mind, and smiled, for he thought he&#10;should find his way through the world&#8212;good courage is a strong&#10;weapon!&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The sun was high in the heavens when he approached the&#10;narrow entrance to Nissum Bay. He looked back and saw a couple of&#10;horsemen galloping a long distance behind him, and there were other&#10;people with them. But this did not concern him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The ferry-boat was on the opposite side of the bay. Jurgen&#10;called to the ferry-man, and the latter came over with his boat.&#10;Jurgen stepped in; but before he had got half-way across, the men&#10;whom he had seen riding so hastily, came up, hailed the ferry-man,&#10;and commanded him to return in the name of the law. Jurgen did not&#10;understand the reason of this, but he thought it would be best to&#10;turn back, and therefore he himself took an oar and returned. As&#10;soon as the boat touched the shore, the men sprang on board, and&#10;before he was aware of it, they had bound his hands with a&#10;rope.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;This wicked deed will cost you your life,&#34; they said. &#34;It&#10;is a good thing we have caught you.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;He was accused of nothing less than murder. Martin had&#10;been found dead, with his throat cut. One of the fishermen, late on&#10;the previous evening, had met Jurgen going towards Martin&#39;s house;&#10;this was not the first time Jurgen had raised his knife against&#10;Martin, so they felt sure that he was the murderer. The prison was&#10;in a town at a great distance, and the wind was contrary for going&#10;there by sea; but it would not take half an hour to get across the&#10;bay, and another quarter of an hour would bring them to&#10;Norre-Vosborg, the great castle with ramparts and moat. One of&#10;Jurgen&#39;s captors was a fisherman, a brother of the keeper of the&#10;castle, and he said it might be managed that Jurgen should be&#10;placed for the present in the dungeon at Vosborg, where Long Martha&#10;the gipsy had been shut up till her execution. They paid no&#10;attention to Jurgen&#39;s defence; the few drops of blood on his&#10;shirt-sleeve bore heavy witness against him. But he was conscious&#10;of his innocence, and as there was no chance of clearing himself at&#10;present he submitted to his fate.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The party landed just at the place where Sir Bugge&#39;s&#10;castle had stood, and where Jurgen had walked with his&#10;foster-parents after the burial feast, during. the four happiest&#10;days of his childhood. He was led by the well-known path, over the&#10;meadow to Vosborg; once more the elders were in bloom and the lofty&#10;lime-trees gave forth sweet fragrance, and it seemed as if it were&#10;but yesterday that he had last seen the spot. In each of the two&#10;wings of the castle there was a staircase which led to a place&#10;below the entrance, from whence there is access to a low, vaulted&#10;cellar. In this dungeon Long Martha had been imprisoned, and from&#10;here she was led away to the scaffold. She had eaten the hearts of&#10;five children, and had imagined that if she could obtain two more&#10;she would be able to fly and make herself invisible. In the middle&#10;of the roof of the cellar there was a little narrow air-hole, but&#10;no window. The flowering lime trees could not breathe refreshing&#10;fragrance into that abode, where everything was dark and mouldy.&#10;There was only a rough bench in the cell; but a good conscience is&#10;a soft pillow, and therefore Jurgen could sleep well.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The thick oaken door was locked, and secured on the&#10;outside by an iron bar; but the goblin of superstition can creep&#10;through a keyhole into a baron&#39;s castle just as easily as it can&#10;into a fisherman&#39;s cottage, and why should he not creep in here,&#10;where Jurgen sat thinking of Long Martha and her wicked deeds? Her&#10;last thoughts on the night before her execution had filled this&#10;place, and the magic that tradition asserted to have been practised&#10;here, in Sir Svanwedel&#39;s time, came into Jurgen&#39;s mind, and made&#10;him shudder; but a sunbeam, a refreshing thought from without,&#10;penetrated his heart even here&#8212;it was the remembrance of the&#10;flowering elder and the sweet smelling lime-trees.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;He was not left there long. They took him away to the town&#10;of Ringkjobing, where he was imprisoned with equal&#10;severity.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Those times were not like ours. The common people were&#10;treated harshly; and it was just after the days when farms were&#10;converted into knights&#39; estates, when coachmen and servants were&#10;often made magistrates, and had power to sentence a poor man, for a&#10;small offence, to lose his property and to corporeal punishment.&#10;Judges of this kind were still to be found; and in Jutland, so far&#10;from the capital, and from the enlightened, well-meaning, head of&#10;the Government, the law was still very loosely administered&#10;sometimes&#8212;the smallest grievance Jurgen could expect was that his&#10;case should be delayed.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;His dwelling was cold and comfortless; and how long would&#10;he be obliged to bear all this? It seemed his fate to suffer&#10;misfortune and sorrow innocently. He now had plenty of time to&#10;reflect on the difference of fortune on earth, and to wonder why&#10;this fate had been allotted to him; yet he felt sure that all would&#10;be made clear in the next life, the existence that awaits us when&#10;this life is over. His faith had grown strong in the poor&#10;fisherman&#39;s cottage; the light which had never shone into his&#10;father&#39;s mind, in all the richness and sunshine of Spain, was sent&#10;to him to be his comfort in poverty and distress, a sign of that&#10;mercy of God which never fails.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The spring storms began to blow. The rolling and moaning&#10;of the North Sea could be heard for miles inland when the wind was&#10;blowing, and then it sounded like the rushing of a thousand waggons&#10;over a hard road with a mine underneath. Jurgen heard these sounds&#10;in his prison, and it was a relief to him. No music could have&#10;touched his heart as did these sounds of the sea&#8212;the rolling sea,&#10;the boundless sea, on which a man can be borne across the world&#10;before the wind, carrying his own house with him wherever he goes,&#10;just as the snail carries its home even into a strange&#10;country.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;He listened eagerly to its deep murmur and then the&#10;thought arose&#8212;&#34;Free! free! How happy to be free, even barefooted&#10;and in ragged clothes!&#34; Sometimes, when such thoughts crossed his&#10;mind, the fiery nature rose within him, and he beat the wall with&#10;his clenched fists.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Weeks, months, a whole year had gone by, when Niels the&#10;thief, called also a horse-dealer, was arrested; and now better&#10;times came, and it was seen that Jurgen had been wrongly&#10;accused.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;On the afternoon before Jurgen&#39;s departure from home, and&#10;before the murder, Niels the thief, had met Martin at a beer-house&#10;in the neighbourhood of Ringkjobing. A few glasses were drank, not&#10;enough to cloud the brain, but enough to loosen Martin&#39;s tongue. He&#10;began to boast and to say that he had obtained a house and intended&#10;to marry, and when Niels asked him where he was going to get the&#10;money, he slapped his pocket proudly and said:&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The money is here, where it ought to be.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;This boast cost him his life; for when he went home Niels&#10;followed him, and cut his throat, intending to rob the murdered man&#10;of the gold, which did not exist.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;All this was circumstantially explained; but it is enough&#10;for us to know that Jurgen was set free. But what compensation did&#10;he get for having been imprisoned a whole year, and shut out from&#10;all communication with his fellow creatures? They told him he was&#10;fortunate in being proved innocent, and that he might go. The&#10;burgomaster gave him two dollars for travelling expenses, and many&#10;citizens offered him provisions and beer&#8212;there were still good&#10;people; they were not all hard and pitiless. But the best thing of&#10;all was that the merchant Bronne, of Skjagen, into whose service&#10;Jurgen had proposed entering the year before, was just at that time&#10;on business in the town of Ringkjobing. Bronne heard the whole&#10;story; he was kind-hearted, and understood what Jurgen must have&#10;felt and suffered. Therefore he made up his mind to make it up to&#10;the poor lad, and convince him that there were still kind folks in&#10;the world.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;So Jurgen went forth from prison as if to paradise, to&#10;find freedom, affection, and trust. He was to travel this path now,&#10;for no goblet of life is all bitterness; no good man would pour out&#10;such a draught for his fellow-man, and how should He do it, Who is&#10;love personified?&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Let everything be buried and forgotten,&#34; said Bronne, the&#10;merchant. &#34;Let us draw a thick line through last year: we will even&#10;burn the almanack. In two days we will start for dear, friendly,&#10;peaceful Skjagen. People call it an out-of-the-way corner; but it&#10;is a good warm chimney-corner, and its windows open toward every&#10;part of the world.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;What a journey that was: It was like taking fresh breath&#10;out of the cold dungeon air into the warm sunshine. The heather&#10;bloomed in pride and beauty, and the shepherd-boy sat on a barrow&#10;and blew his pipe, which he had carved for himself out of a sheep&#10;bone. Fata Morgana, the beautiful aerial phenomenon of the&#10;wilderness, appeared with hanging gardens and waving forests, and&#10;the wonderful cloud called &#34;Lokeman driving his sheep&#34; also was&#10;seen.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Up towards Skjagen they went, through the land of the&#10;Wendels, whence the men with long beards (the Longobardi or&#10;Lombards) had emigrated in the reign of King Snio, when all the&#10;children and old people were to have been killed, till the noble&#10;Dame Gambaruk proposed that the young people should emigrate.&#10;Jurgen knew all this, he had some little knowledge; and although he&#10;did not know the land of the Lombards beyond the lofty Alps, he had&#10;an idea that it must be there, for in his boyhood he had been in&#10;the south, in Spain. He thought of the plenteousness of the&#10;southern fruit, of the red pomegranate flowers, of the humming,&#10;buzzing, and toiling in the great beehive of a city he had seen;&#10;but home is the best place after all, and Jurgen&#39;s home was&#10;Denmark.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;At last they arrived at &#34;Vendilskaga,&#34; as Skjagen is&#10;called in old Norwegian and Icelandic writings. At that time Old&#10;Skjagen, with the eastern and western town, extended for miles,&#10;with sand hills and arable land as far as the lighthouse near&#10;&#34;Grenen.&#34; Then, as now, the houses were strewn among the&#10;wind-raised sand-hills&#8212;a wilderness in which the wind sports with&#10;the sand, and where the voice of the sea-gull and wild swan strikes&#10;harshly on the ear.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the south-west, a mile from &#34;Grenen,&#34; lies Old Skjagen;&#10;merchant Bronne dwelt here, and this was also to be Jurgen&#39;s home&#10;for the future. The dwelling-house was tarred, and all the small&#10;out-buildings had been put together from pieces of wreck. There was&#10;no fence, for indeed there was nothing to fence in except the long&#10;rows of fishes which were hung upon lines, one above the other, to&#10;dry in the wind. The entire coast was strewn with spoiled herrings,&#10;for there were so many of these fish that a net was scarcely thrown&#10;into the sea before it was filled. They were caught by carloads,&#10;and many of them were either thrown back into the sea or left to&#10;lie on the beach.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The old man&#39;s wife and daughter and his servants also came&#10;to meet him with great rejoicing. There was a great squeezing of&#10;hands, and talking and questioning. And the daughter, what a sweet&#10;face and bright eyes she had!&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The inside of the house was comfortable and roomy.&#10;Fritters, that a king would have looked upon as a dainty dish, were&#10;placed on the table, and there was wine from the Skjagen&#10;vineyard&#8212;that is, the sea; for there the grapes come ashore ready&#10;pressed and prepared in barrels and in bottles.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;When the mother and daughter heard who Jurgen was, and how&#10;innocently he had suffered, they looked at him in a still more&#10;friendly way; and pretty Clara&#39;s eyes had a look of especial&#10;interest as she listened to his story. Jurgen found a happy home in&#10;Old Skjagen. It did his heart good, for it had been sorely tried.&#10;He had drunk the bitter goblet of love which softens or hardens the&#10;heart, according to circumstances. Jurgen&#39;s heart was still soft&#8212;it&#10;was young, and therefore it was a good thing that Miss Clara was&#10;going in three weeks&#39; time to Christiansand in Norway, in her&#10;father&#39;s ship, to visit an aunt and to stay there the whole&#10;winter.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;On the Sunday before she went away they all went to&#10;church, to the Holy Communion. The church was large and handsome,&#10;and had been built centuries before by Scotchmen and Dutchmen; it&#10;stood some little way out of the town. It was rather ruinous&#10;certainly, and the road to it was heavy, through deep sand, but the&#10;people gladly surmounted these difficulties to get to the house of&#10;God, to sing psalms and to hear the sermon. The sand had heaped&#10;itself up round the walls of the church, but the graves were kept&#10;free from it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was the largest church north of the Limfjorden. The&#10;Virgin Mary, with a golden crown on her head and the child Jesus in&#10;her arms, stood lifelike on the altar; the holy Apostles had been&#10;carved in the choir, and on the walls there were portraits of the&#10;old burgomasters and councillors of Skjagen; the pulpit was of&#10;carved work. The sun shone brightly into the church, and its&#10;radiance fell on the polished brass chandelier and on the little&#10;ship that hung from the vaulted roof.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Jurgen felt overcome by a holy, childlike feeling, like&#10;that which possessed him, when, as a boy, he stood in the splendid&#10;Spanish cathedral. But here the feeling was different, for he felt&#10;conscious of being one of the congregation.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;After the sermon followed Holy Communion. He partook of&#10;the bread and wine, and it so happened that he knelt by the side of&#10;Miss Clara; but his thoughts were so fixed upon heaven and the Holy&#10;Sacrament that he did not notice his neighbour until he rose from&#10;his knees, and then he saw tears rolling down her&#10;cheeks.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;She left Skjagen and went to Norway two days later. He&#10;remained behind, and made himself useful on the farm and at the&#10;fishery. He went out fishing, and in those days fish were more&#10;plentiful and larger than they are now. The shoals of the mackerel&#10;glittered in the dark nights, and indicated where they were&#10;swimming; the gurnards snarled, and the crabs gave forth pitiful&#10;yells when they were chased, for fish are not so mute as people&#10;say.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Every Sunday Jurgen went to church; and when his eyes&#10;rested on the picture of the Virgin Mary over the altar as he sat&#10;there, they often glided away to the spot where they had knelt side&#10;by side.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Autumn came, and brought rain and snow with it; the water&#10;rose up right into the town of Skjagen, the sand could not suck it&#10;all in, one had to wade through it or go by boat. The storms threw&#10;vessel after vessel on the fatal reefs; there were snow-storm and&#10;sand-storms; the sand flew up to the houses, blocking the&#10;entrances, so that people had to creep up through the chimneys;&#10;that was nothing at all remarkable here. It was pleasant and&#10;cheerful indoors, where peat fuel and fragments of wood from the&#10;wrecks blazed and crackled upon the hearth. Merchant Bronne read&#10;aloud, from an old chronicle, about Prince Hamlet of Denmark, who&#10;had come over from England, landed near Bovbjerg, and fought a&#10;battle; close by Ramme was his grave, only a few miles from the&#10;place where the eel-breeder lived; hundreds of barrow rose there&#10;from the heath, forming as it were an enormous churchyard. Merchant&#10;Bronne had himself been at Hamlet&#39;s grave; they spoke about old&#10;times, and about their neighbours, the English and the Scotch, and&#10;Jurgen sang the air of &#34;The King of England&#39;s Son,&#34; and of his&#10;splendid ship and its outfit.&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;In the hour of peril when most men fear,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;He clasped the bride that he held so dear,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;And proved himself the son of a King;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Of his courage and valour let us sing.&#34;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;This verse Jurgen sang with so much feeling that his eyes&#10;beamed, and they were black and sparkling since his&#10;infancy.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;There was wealth, comfort, and happiness even among the&#10;domestic animals, for they were all well cared for, and well kept.&#10;The kitchen looked bright with its copper and tin utensils, and&#10;white plates, and from the rafters hung hams, beef, and winter&#10;stores in plenty. This can still be seen in many rich farms on the&#10;west coast of Jutland: plenty to eat and drink, clean, prettily&#10;decorated rooms, active minds, cheerful tempers, and hospitality&#10;can be found there, as in an Arab&#39;s tent.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Jurgen had never spent such a happy time since the famous&#10;burial feast, and yet Miss Clara was absent, except in the thoughts&#10;and memory of all.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In April a ship was to start for Norway, and Jurgen was to&#10;sail in it. He was full of life and spirits, and looked so sturdy&#10;and well that Dame Bronne said it did her good to see&#10;him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And it does one good to look at you also, old wife,&#34; said&#10;the merchant. &#34;Jurgen has brought fresh life into our winter&#10;evenings, and into you too, mother. You look younger than ever this&#10;year, and seem well and cheerful. But then you were once the&#10;prettiest girl in Viborg, and that is saying a great deal, for I&#10;have always found the Viborg girls the prettiest of&#10;any.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Jurgen said nothing, but he thought of a certain maiden of&#10;Skjagen, whom he was soon to visit. The ship set sail for&#10;Christiansand in Norway, and as the wind was favourable it soon&#10;arrived there.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;One morning merchant Bronne went out to the lighthouse,&#10;which stands a little way out of Old Skjagen, not far from&#10;&#34;Grenen.&#34; The light was out, and the sun was already high in the&#10;heavens, when he mounted the tower. The sand-banks extend a whole&#10;mile from the shore, beneath the water, outside these banks; many&#10;ships could be seen that day, and with the aid of his telescope the&#10;old man thought he descried his own ship, the Karen Bronne. Yes!&#10;certainly, there she was, sailing homewards with Clara and Jurgen&#10;on board.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Clara sat on deck, and saw the sand-hills gradually&#10;appearing in the distance; the church and lighthouse looked like a&#10;heron and a swan rising from the blue waters. If the wind held good&#10;they might reach home in about an hour. So near they were to home&#10;and all its joys&#8212;so near to death and all its terrors! A plank in&#10;the ship gave way, and the water rushed in; the crew flew to the&#10;pumps, and did their best to stop the leak. A signal of distress&#10;was hoisted, but they were still fully a mile from the shore. Some&#10;fishing boats were in sight, but they were too far off to be of any&#10;use. The wind blew towards the land, the tide was in their favour,&#10;but it was all useless; the ship could not be saved.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Jurgen threw his right arm round Clara, and pressed her to&#10;him. With what a look she gazed up into his face, as with a prayer&#10;to God for help he breasted the waves, which rushed over the&#10;sinking ship! She uttered a cry, but she felt safe and certain that&#10;he would not leave her to sink. And in this hour of terror and&#10;danger Jurgen felt as the king&#39;s son did, as told in the old&#10;song:&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;In the hour of peril when most men fear,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;He clasped the bride that he held so dear.&#34;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;How glad he felt that he was a good swimmer! He worked his&#10;way onward with his feet and one arm, while he held the young girl&#10;up firmly with the other. He rested on the waves, he trod the&#10;water&#8212;in fact, did everything he could think of, in order not to&#10;fatigue himself, and to reserve strength enough to reach land. He&#10;heard Clara sigh, and felt her shudder convulsively, and he pressed&#10;her more closely to him. Now and then a wave rolled over them, the&#10;current lifted them; the water, although deep, was so clear that&#10;for a moment he imagined he saw the shoals of mackerel glittering,&#10;or Leviathan himself ready to swallow them. Now the clouds cast a&#10;shadow over the water, then again came the playing sunbeams; flocks&#10;of loudly screaming birds passed over him, and the plump and lazy&#10;wild ducks which allow themselves to be drifted by the waves rose&#10;up terrified at the sight of the swimmer. He began to feel his&#10;strength decreasing, but he was only a few cable lengths&#39; distance&#10;from the shore, and help was coming, for a boat was approaching&#10;him. At this moment he distinctly saw a white staring figure under&#10;the water&#8212;a wave lifted him up, and he came nearer to the figure&#8212;he&#10;felt a violent shock, and everything became dark around&#10;him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;On the sand reef lay the wreck of a ship, which was&#10;covered with water at high tide; the white figure head rested&#10;against the anchor, the sharp iron edge of which rose just above&#10;the surface. Jurgen had come in contact with this; the tide had&#10;driven him against it with great force. He sank down stunned with&#10;the blow, but the next wave lifted him and the young girl up again.&#10;Some fishermen, coming with a boat, seized them and dragged them&#10;into it. The blood streamed down over Jurgen&#39;s face; he seemed&#10;dead, but still held the young girl so tightly that they were&#10;obliged to take her from him by force. She was pale and lifeless;&#10;they laid her in the boat, and rowed as quickly as possible to the&#10;shore. They tried every means to restore Clara to life, but it was&#10;all of no avail. Jurgen had been swimming for some distance with a&#10;corpse in his arms, and had exhausted his strength for one who was&#10;dead.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Jurgen still breathed, so the fishermen carried him to the&#10;nearest house upon the sand-hills, where a smith and general dealer&#10;lived who knew something of surgery, and bound up Jurgen&#39;s wounds&#10;in a temporary way until a surgeon could be obtained from the&#10;nearest town the next day. The injured man&#39;s brain was affected,&#10;and in his delirium he uttered wild cries; but on the third day he&#10;lay quiet and weak upon his bed; his life seemed to hang by a&#10;thread, and the physician said it would be better for him if this&#10;thread broke. &#34;Let us pray that God may take him,&#34; he said, &#34;for he&#10;will never be the same man again.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But life did not depart from him&#8212;the thread would not&#10;break, but the thread of memory was severed; the thread of his mind&#10;had been cut through, and what was still more grievous, a body&#10;remained&#8212;a living healthy body that wandered about like a troubled&#10;spirit.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Jurgen remained in merchant Bronne&#39;s house. &#34;He was hurt&#10;while endeavouring to save our child,&#34; said the old man, &#34;and now&#10;he is our son.&#34; People called Jurgen insane, but that was not&#10;exactly the correct term. He was like an instrument in which the&#10;strings are loose and will give no sound; only occasionally they&#10;regained their power for a few minutes, and then they sounded as&#10;they used to do. He would sing snatches of songs or old melodies,&#10;pictures of the past would rise before him, and then disappear in&#10;the mist, as it were, but as a general rule he sat staring into&#10;vacancy, without a thought. We may conjecture that he did not&#10;suffer, but his dark eyes lost their brightness, and looked like&#10;clouded glass.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Poor mad Jurgen,&#34; said the people. And this was the end&#10;of a life whose infancy was to have been surrounded with wealth and&#10;splendour had his parents lived! All his great mental abilities had&#10;been lost, nothing but hardship, sorrow, and disappointment had&#10;been his fate. He was like a rare plant, torn from its native soil,&#10;and tossed upon the beach to wither there. And was this one of&#10;God&#39;s creatures, fashioned in His own likeness, to have no better&#10;fate? Was he to be only the plaything of fortune? No! the&#10;all-loving Creator would certainly repay him in the life to come&#10;for what he had suffered and lost here. &#34;The Lord is good to all;&#10;and His mercy is over all His works.&#34; The pious old wife of the&#10;merchant repeated these words from the Psalms of David in patience&#10;and hope, and the prayer of her heart was that Jurgen might soon be&#10;called away to enter into eternal life.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the churchyard where the walls were surrounded with&#10;sand Clara lay buried. Jurgen did not seem to know this; it did not&#10;enter his mind, which could only retain fragments of the past.&#10;Every Sunday he went to church with the old people, and sat there&#10;silently, staring vacantly before him. One day, when the Psalms&#10;were being sung, he sighed deeply, and his eyes became bright; they&#10;were fixed upon a place near the altar where he had knelt with his&#10;friend who was dead. He murmured her name, and became deadly pale,&#10;and tears rolled down his cheeks. They led him out of church; he&#10;told those standing round him that he was well, and had never been&#10;ill; he, who had been so grievously afflicted, the outcast, thrown&#10;upon the world, could not remember his sufferings. The Lord our&#10;Creator is wise and full of loving kindness&#8212;who can doubt&#10;it?&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In Spain, where balmy breezes blow over the Moorish&#10;cupolas and gently stir the orange and myrtle groves, where singing&#10;and the sound of the castanets are always heard, the richest&#10;merchant in the place, a childless old man, sat in a luxurious&#10;house, while children marched in procession through the streets&#10;with waving flags and lighted tapers. If he had been able to press&#10;his children to his heart, his daughter, or her child, that had,&#10;perhaps never seen the light of day, far less the kingdom of&#10;heaven, how much of his wealth would he not have given! &#34;Poor&#10;child!&#34; Yes, poor child&#8212;a child still, yet more than thirty years&#10;old, for Jurgen had arrived at this age in Old Skjagen.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The shifting sands had covered the graves in the&#10;courtyard, quite up to the church walls, but still, the dead must&#10;be buried among their relatives and the dear ones who had gone&#10;before them. Merchant Bronne and his wife now rested with their&#10;children under the white sand.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was in the spring&#8212;the season of storms. The sand from&#10;the dunes was whirled up in clouds; the sea was rough, and flocks&#10;of birds flew like clouds in the storm, screaming across the&#10;sand-hills. Shipwreck followed upon shipwreck on the reefs between&#10;Old Skagen and the Hunsby dunes.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;One evening Jurgen sat in his room alone: all at once his&#10;mind seemed to become clearer, and a restless feeling came over&#10;him, such as had often, in his younger days, driven him out to&#10;wander over the sand-hills or on the heath. &#34;Home, home!&#34; he cried.&#10;No one heard him. He went out and walked towards the dunes. Sand&#10;and stones blew into his face, and whirled round him; he went in&#10;the direction of the church. The sand was banked up the walls, half&#10;covering the windows, but it had been cleared away in front of the&#10;door, and the entrance was free and easy to open, so Jurgen went&#10;into the church.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The storm raged over the town of Skjagen; there had not&#10;been such a terrible tempest within the memory of the inhabitants,&#10;nor such a rough sea. But Jurgen was in the temple of God, and&#10;while the darkness of night reigned outside, a light arose in his&#10;soul that was never to depart from it; the heavy weight that&#10;pressed on his brain burst asunder. He fancied he heard the organ,&#10;but it was only the storm and the moaning of the sea. He sat down&#10;on one of the seats, and lo! the candies were lighted one by one,&#10;and there was brightness and grandeur such as he had only seen in&#10;the Spanish cathedral. The portraits of the old citizens became&#10;alive, stepped down from the walls against which they had hung for&#10;centuries, and took seats near the church door. The gates flew&#10;open, and all the dead people from the churchyard came in, and&#10;filled the church, while beautiful music sounded. Then the melody&#10;of the psalm burst forth, like the sound of the waters, and Jurgen&#10;saw that his foster parents from the Hunsby dunes were there, also&#10;old merchant Bronne with his wife and their daughter Clara, who&#10;gave him her hand. They both went up to the altar where they had&#10;knelt before, and the priest joined their hands and united them for&#10;life. Then music was heard again; it was wonderfully sweet, like a&#10;child&#39;s voice, full of joy and expectation, swelling to the&#10;powerful tones of a full organ, sometimes soft and sweet, then like&#10;the sounds of a tempest, delightful and elevating to hear, yet&#10;strong enough to burst the stone tombs of the dead. Then the little&#10;ship that hung from the roof of the choir was let down and looked&#10;wonderfully large and beautiful with its silken sails and&#10;rigging:&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The ropes were of silk, the anchor of gold,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;And everywhere riches and pomp untold,&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;as the old song says.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The young couple went on board, accompanied by the whole&#10;congregation, for there was room and enjoyment for them all. Then&#10;the walls and arches of the church were covered with flowering&#10;junipers and lime trees breathing forth fragrance; the branches&#10;waved, creating a pleasant coolness; they bent and parted, and the&#10;ship sailed between them through the air and over the sea. Every&#10;candle in the church became a star, and the wind sang a hymn in&#10;which they all joined. &#34;Through love to glory, no life is lost, the&#10;future is full of blessings and happiness. Hallelujah!&#34; These were&#10;the last words Jurgen uttered in this world, for the thread that&#10;bound his immortal soul was severed, and nothing but the dead body&#10;lay in the dark church, while the storm raged outside, covering it&#10;with loose sand.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The next day was Sunday, and the congregation and their&#10;pastor went to the church. The road had always been heavy, but now&#10;it was almost unfit for use, and when they at last arrived at the&#10;church, a great heap of sand lay piled up in front of them. The&#10;whole church was completely buried in sand. The clergyman offered a&#10;short prayer, and said that God had closed the door of His house&#10;here, and that the congregation must go and build a new one for Him&#10;somewhere else. So they sung a hymn in the open air, and went home&#10;again.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Jurgen could not be found anywhere in the town of Skjagen,&#10;nor on the dunes, though they searched for him everywhere. They&#10;came to the conclusion that one of the great waves, which had&#10;rolled far up on the beach, had carried him away; but his body lay&#10;buried in a great sepulchre&#8212;the church itself. The Lord had thrown&#10;down a covering for his grave during the storm, and the heavy mound&#10;of sand lies upon it to this day. The drifting sand had covered the&#10;vaulted roof of the church, the arched cloisters, and the stone&#10;aisles. The white thorn and the dog rose now blossom above the&#10;place where the church lies buried, but the spire, like an enormous&#10;monument over a grave, can be seen for miles round. No king has a&#10;more splendid memorial. Nothing disturbs the peaceful sleep of the&#10;dead. I was the first to hear this story, for the storm sung it to&#10;me among the sand-hills.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)

We look at the numerous ships, and at the Swedish coast on&#10;the opposite side of the sound, rising far above the surface of the&#10;waters which mirror the glow of the evening sky. Behind us the wood&#10;is sharply defined; mighty trees surround us, and the yellow leaves&#10;flutter down from the branches. Below, at the foot of the wall,&#10;stands a gloomy looking building enclosed in palisades. The space&#10;between is dark and narrow, but still more dismal must it be behind&#10;the iron gratings in the wall which cover the narrow loopholes or&#10;windows, for in these dungeons the most depraved of the criminals&#10;are confined. A ray of the setting sun shoots into the bare cells&#10;of one of the captives, for God&#39;s sun shines upon the evil and the&#10;good. The hardened criminal casts an impatient look at the bright&#10;ray. Then a little bird flies towards the grating, for birds&#10;twitter to the just as well as to the unjust. He only cries,&#10;&#34;Tweet, tweet,&#34; and then perches himself near the grating, flutters&#10;his wings, pecks a feather from one of them, puffs himself out, and&#10;sets his feathers on end round his breast and throat. The bad,&#10;chained man looks at him, and a more gentle expression comes into&#10;his hard face. In his breast there rises a thought which he himself&#10;cannot rightly analyze, but the thought has some connection with&#10;the sunbeam, with the bird, and with the scent of violets, which&#10;grow luxuriantly in spring at the foot of the wall. Then there&#10;comes the sound of the hunter&#39;s horn, merry and full. The little&#10;bird starts, and flies away, the sunbeam gradually vanishes, and&#10;again there is darkness in the room and in the heart of that bad&#10;man. Still the sun has shone into that heart, and the twittering of&#10;the bird has touched it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Sound on, ye glorious strains of the hunter&#39;s horn;&#10;continue your stirring tones, for the evening is mild, and the&#10;surface of the sea, heaving slowly and calmly, is smooth as a&#10;mirror.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)

This&#10;flight of swans men called the Lombards.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Another flock, with shining plumage and honest eyes,&#10;soared southward to Byzantium; the swans established themselves&#10;there close by the Emperor&#39;s throne, and spread their wings over&#10;him as shields to protect him. They received the name of&#10;Varangians.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;On the coast of France there sounded a cry of fear, for&#10;the blood-stained swans that came from the North with fire under&#10;their wings; and the people prayed, &#34;Heaven deliver us from the&#10;wild Northmen.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;On the fresh sward of England stood the Danish swan by the&#10;open seashore, with the crown of three kingdoms on his head; and he&#10;stretched out his golden sceptre over the land. The heathens on the&#10;Pomerian coast bent the knee, and the Danish swans came with the&#10;banner of the Cross and with the drawn sword.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That was in the very old times,&#34; you say.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In later days two mighty swans have been seen to fly from&#10;the nest. A light shone far through the air, far over the lands of&#10;the earth; the swan, with the strong beating of his wings,&#10;scattered the twilight mists, and the starry sky was seen, and it&#10;was as if it came nearer to the earth. That was the swan Tycho&#10;Brahe.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, then,&#34; you say; &#34;but in our own days?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;We have seen swan after swan soar by in glorious flight.&#10;One let his pinions glide over the strings of the golden harp, and&#10;it resounded through the North. Norway&#39;s mountains seemed to rise&#10;higher in the sunlight of former days; there was a rustling among&#10;the pine trees and the birches; the gods of the North, the heroes,&#10;and the noble women, showed themselves in the dark forest&#10;depths.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;We have seen a swan beat with his wings upon the marble&#10;crag, so that it burst, and the forms of beauty imprisoned in the&#10;stone stepped out to the sunny day, and men in the lands round&#10;about lifted up their heads to behold these mighty&#10;forms.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;We have seen a third swan spinning the thread of thought&#10;that is fastened from country to country round the world, so that&#10;the word may fly with lightning speed from land to land.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And our Lord loves the old swan&#39;s nest between the Baltic&#10;and the North Sea. And when the mighty birds come soaring through&#10;the air to destroy it, even the callow young stand round in a&#10;circle on the margin of the nest, and though their breasts may be&#10;struck so that their blood flows, they bear it, and strike with&#10;their wings and their claws.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Centuries will pass by, swans will fly forth from the&#10;nest, men will see them and hear them in the world, before it shall&#10;be said in spirit and in truth, &#34;This is the last swan&#8212;the last&#10;song from the swan&#39;s nest.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Swineherd'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;ONCE upon a time lived a poor prince; his kingdom was very&#10;small, but it was large enough to enable him to marry, and marry he&#10;would. It was rather bold of him that he went and asked the&#10;emperor&#39;s daughter: &#34;Will you marry me?&#34; but he ventured to do so,&#10;for his name was known far and wide, and there were hundreds of&#10;princesses who would have gladly accepted him, but would she do so?&#10;Now we shall see.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;On the grave of the prince&#39;s father grew a rose-tree, the&#10;most beautiful of its kind. It bloomed only once in five years, and&#10;then it had only one single rose upon it, but what a rose! It had&#10;such a sweet scent that one instantly forgot all sorrow and grief&#10;when one smelt it. He had also a nightingale, which could sing as&#10;if every sweet melody was in its throat. This rose and the&#10;nightingale he wished to give to the princess; and therefore both&#10;were put into big silver cases and sent to her.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The emperor ordered them to be carried into the great hall&#10;where the princess was just playing &#34;Visitors are coming&#34; with her&#10;ladies-in-waiting; when she saw the large cases with the presents&#10;therein, she clapped her hands for joy.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I wish it were a little pussy cat,&#34; she said. But then&#10;the rose-tree with the beautiful rose was unpacked.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, how nicely it is made,&#34; exclaimed the&#10;ladies.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It is more than nice,&#34; said the emperor, &#34;it is&#10;charming.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The princess touched it and nearly began to&#10;cry.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;For shame, pa,&#34; she said, &#34;it is not artificial, it is&#10;natural!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;For shame, it is natural&#34; repeated all her&#10;ladies.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Let us first see what the other case contains before we&#10;are angry,&#34; said the emperor; then the nightingale was taken out,&#10;and it sang so beautifully that no one could possibly say anything&#10;unkind about it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Superbe, charmant,&#34; said the ladies of the court, for&#10;they all prattled French, one worse than the other.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;How much the bird reminds me of the musical box of the&#10;late lamented empress,&#34; said an old courtier, &#34;it has exactly the&#10;same tone, the same execution.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You are right,&#34; said the emperor, and began to cry like a&#10;little child.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I hope it is not natural,&#34; said the princess.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, certainly it is natural,&#34; replied those who had&#10;brought the presents.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Then let it fly,&#34; said the princess, and refused to see&#10;the prince.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But the prince was not discouraged. He painted his face,&#10;put on common clothes, pulled his cap over his forehead, and came&#10;back.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Good day, emperor,&#34; he said, &#34;could you not give me some&#10;employment at the court?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;There are so many,&#34; replied the emperor, &#34;who apply for&#10;places, that for the present I have no vacancy, but I will remember&#10;you. But wait a moment; it just comes into my mind, I require&#10;somebody to look after my pigs, for I have a great&#10;many.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Thus the prince was appointed imperial swineherd, and as&#10;such he lived in a wretchedly small room near the pigsty; there he&#10;worked all day long, and when it was night he had made a pretty&#10;little pot. There were little bells round the rim, and when the&#10;water began to boil in it, the bells began to play the old&#10;tune:&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;A jolly old sow once lived in a sty,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Three little piggies had she,&#34; &#38;amp;c.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But what was more wonderful was that, when one put a&#10;finger into the steam rising from the pot, one could at once smell&#10;what meals they were preparing on every fire in the whole town.&#10;That was indeed much more remarkable than the rose. When the&#10;princess with her ladies passed by and heard the tune, she stopped&#10;and looked quite pleased, for she also could play it&#8212;in fact, it&#10;was the only tune she could play, and she played it with one&#10;finger.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That is the tune I know,&#34; she exclaimed. &#34;He must be a&#10;well-educated swineherd. Go and ask him how much the instrument&#10;is.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;One of the ladies had to go and ask; but she put on&#10;pattens.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What will you take for your pot?&#34; asked the&#10;lady.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I will have ten kisses from the princess,&#34; said the&#10;swineherd.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;God forbid,&#34; said the lady.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Well, I cannot sell it for less,&#34; replied the&#10;swineherd.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What did he say?&#34; said the princess.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;I really cannot tell you,&#34; replied the lady.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You can whisper it into my ear.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It is very naughty,&#34; said the princess, and walked&#10;off.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But when she had gone a little distance, the bells rang&#10;again so sweetly:&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;A jolly old sow once lived in a sty,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Three little piggies had she,&#34; &#38;amp;c.&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ask him,&#34; said the princess, &#34;if he will be satisfied&#10;with ten kisses from one of my ladies.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No, thank you,&#34; said the swineherd: &#34;ten kisses from the&#10;princess, or I keep my pot.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That is tiresome,&#34; said the princess. &#34;But you must stand&#10;before me, so that nobody can see it.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The ladies placed themselves in front of her and spread&#10;out their dresses, and she gave the swineherd ten kisses and&#10;received the pot.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;That was a pleasure! Day and night the water in the pot&#10;was boiling; there was not a single fire in the whole town of which&#10;they did not know what was preparing on it, the chamberlain&#39;s as&#10;well as the shoemaker&#39;s. The ladies danced and clapped their hands&#10;for joy.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;We know who will eat soup and pancakes; we know who will&#10;eat porridge and cutlets; oh, how interesting!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Very interesting, indeed,&#34; said the mistress of the&#10;household. &#34;But you must not betray me, for I am the emperor&#39;s&#10;daughter.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Of course not,&#34; they all said.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The swineherd&#8212;that is to say, the prince&#8212;but they did not&#10;know otherwise than that he was a real swineherd&#8212;did not waste a&#10;single day without doing something; he made a rattle, which, when&#10;turned quickly round, played all the waltzes, galops, and polkas&#10;known since the creation of the world.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But that is superbe,&#34; said the princess passing by. &#34;I&#10;have never heard a more beautiful composition. Go down and ask him&#10;what the instrument costs; but I shall not kiss him&#10;again.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;He will have a hundred kisses from the princess,&#34; said&#10;the lady, who had gone down to ask him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I believe he is mad,&#34; said the princess, and walked off,&#10;but soon she stopped. &#34;One must encourage art,&#34; she said. &#34;I am the&#10;emperor&#39;s daughter! Tell him I will give him ten kisses, as I did&#10;the other day; the remainder one of my ladies can give&#10;him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But we do not like to kiss him&#34; said the&#10;ladies.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That is nonsense,&#34; said the princess; &#34;if I can kiss him,&#10;you can also do it. Remember that I give you food and employment.&#34;&#10;And the lady had to go down once more.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;A hundred kisses from the princess,&#34; said the swineherd,&#10;&#34;or everybody keeps his own.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Place yourselves before me,&#34; said the princess then. They&#10;did as they were bidden, and the princess kissed him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I wonder what that crowd near the pigsty means!&#34; said the&#10;emperor, who had just come out on his balcony. He rubbed his eyes&#10;and put his spectacles on.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The ladies of the court are up to some mischief, I think.&#10;I shall have to go down and see.&#34; He pulled up his shoes, for they&#10;were down at the heels, and he was very quick about it. When he had&#10;come down into the courtyard he walked quite softly, and the ladies&#10;were so busily engaged in counting the kisses, that all should be&#10;fair, that they did not notice the emperor. He raised himself on&#10;tiptoe.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What does this mean?&#34; he said, when he saw that his&#10;daughter was kissing the swineherd, and then hit their heads with&#10;his shoe just as the swineherd received the sixty-eighth&#10;kiss.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Go out of my sight,&#34; said the emperor, for he was very&#10;angry; and both the princess and the swineherd were banished from&#10;the empire. There she stood and cried, the swineherd scolded her,&#10;and the rain came down in torrents.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Alas, unfortunate creature that I am!&#34; said the princess,&#10;&#34;I wish I had accepted the prince. Oh, how wretched I&#10;am!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The swineherd went behind a tree, wiped his face, threw&#10;off his poor attire and stepped forth in his princely garments; he&#10;looked so beautiful that the princess could not help bowing to&#10;him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I have now learnt to despise you,&#34; he said. &#34;You refused&#10;an honest prince; you did not appreciate the rose and the&#10;nightingale; but you did not mind kissing a swineherd for his toys;&#10;you have no one but yourself to blame!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And then he returned into his kingdom and left her behind.&#10;She could now sing at her leisure:&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;A jolly old sow once lived in a sty,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Three little piggies has she,&#34; &#38;amp;c.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Toad'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;THE well was deep, and therefore the rope had to be a long&#10;one; it was heavy work turning the handle when any one had to raise&#10;a bucketful of water over the edge of the well. Though the water&#10;was clear, the sun never looked down far enough into the well to&#10;mirror itself in the waters; but as far as its beams could reach,&#10;green things grew forth between the stones in the sides of the&#10;well.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Down below dwelt a family of the Toad race. They had, in&#10;fact, come head-over-heels down the well, in the person of the old&#10;Mother-Toad, who was still alive. The green Frogs, who had been&#10;established there a long time, and swam about in the water, called&#10;them &#34;well-guests.&#34; But the new-comers seemed determined to stay&#10;where they were, for they found it very agreeable living &#34;in a dry&#10;place,&#34; as they called the wet stones.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Mother-Frog had once been a traveller. She happened to&#10;be in the water-bucket when it was drawn up, but the light became&#10;too strong for her, and she got a pain in her eyes. Fortunately she&#10;scrambled out of the bucket; but she fell into the water with a&#10;terrible flop, and had to lie sick for three days with pains in her&#10;back. She certainly had not much to tell of the things up above,&#10;but she knew this, and all the Frogs knew it, that the well was not&#10;all the world. The Mother-Toad might have told this and that, if&#10;she had chosen, but she never answered when they asked her&#10;anything, and so they left off asking.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;She&#39;s thick, and fat and ugly,&#34; said the young green&#10;Frogs; &#34;and her children will be just as ugly as she&#10;is.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That may be,&#34; retorted the mother-Toad, &#34;but one of them&#10;has a jewel in his head, or else I have the jewel.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The young frogs listened and stared; and as these words&#10;did not please them, they made grimaces and dived down under the&#10;water. But the little Toads kicked up their hind legs from mere&#10;pride, for each of them thought that he must have the jewel; and&#10;then they sat and held their heads quite still. But at length they&#10;asked what it was that made them so proud, and what kind of a thing&#10;a jewel might be.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, it is such a splendid and precious thing, that I&#10;cannot describe it,&#34; said the Mother-Toad. &#34;It&#39;s something which&#10;one carries about for one&#39;s own pleasure, and that makes other&#10;people angry. But don&#39;t ask me any questions, for I shan&#39;t answer&#10;you.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Well, I haven&#39;t got the jewel,&#34; said the smallest of the&#10;Toads; she was as ugly as a toad can be. &#34;Why should I have such a&#10;precious thing? And if it makes others angry, it can&#39;t give me any&#10;pleasure. No, I only wish I could get to the edge of the well, and&#10;look out; it must be beautiful up there.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You&#39;d better stay where you are,&#34; said the old&#10;Mother-Toad, &#34;for you know everything here, and you can tell what&#10;you have. Take care of the bucket, for it will crush you to death;&#10;and even if you get into it safely, you may fall out. And it&#39;s not&#10;every one who falls so cleverly as I did, and gets away with whole&#10;legs and whole bones.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Quack!&#34; said the little Toad; and that&#39;s just as if one&#10;of us were to say, &#34;Aha!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;She had an immense desire to get to the edge of the well,&#10;and to look over; she felt such a longing for the green, up there;&#10;and the next morning, when it chanced that the bucket was being&#10;drawn up, filled with water, and stopped for a moment just in front&#10;of the stone on which the Toad sat, the little creature&#39;s heart&#10;moved within it, and our Toad jumped into the filled bucket, which&#10;presently was drawn to the top, and emptied out.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ugh, you beast!&#34; said the farm laborer who emptied the&#10;bucket, when he saw the toad. &#34;You&#39;re the ugliest thing I&#39;ve seen&#10;for one while.&#34; And he made a kick with his wooden shoe at the&#10;toad, which just escaped being crushed by managing to scramble into&#10;the nettles which grew high by the well&#39;s brink. Here she saw stem&#10;by stem, but she looked up also; the sun shone through the leaves,&#10;which were quite transparent; and she felt as a person would feel&#10;who steps suddenly into a great forest, where the sun looks in&#10;between the branches and leaves.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It&#39;s much nicer here than down in the well! I should like&#10;to stay here my whole life long!&#34; said the little Toad. So she lay&#10;there for an hour, yes, for two hours. &#34;I wonder what is to be&#10;found up here? As I have come so far, I must try to go still&#10;farther.&#34; And so she crawled on as fast as she could crawl, and got&#10;out upon the highway, where the sun shone upon her, and the dust&#10;powdered her all over as she marched across the way.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I&#39;ve got to a dry place. now, and no mistake,&#34; said the&#10;Toad. &#34;It&#39;s almost too much of a good thing here; it tickles one&#10;so.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;She came to the ditch; and forget-me-nots were growing&#10;there, and meadow-sweet; and a very little way off was a hedge of&#10;whitethorn, and elder bushes grew there, too, and bindweed with&#10;white flowers. Gay colors were to be seen here, and a butterfly,&#10;too, was flitting by. The Toad thought it was a flower which had&#10;broken loose that it might look about better in the world, which&#10;was quite a natural thing to do.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;If one could only make such a journey as that!&#34; said the&#10;Toad. &#34;Croak! how capital that would be.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Eight days and eight nights she stayed by the well, and&#10;experienced no want of provisions. On the ninth day she thought,&#10;&#34;Forward! onward!&#34; But what could she find more charming and&#10;beautiful? Perhaps a little toad or a few green frogs. During the&#10;last night there had been a sound borne on the breeze, as if there&#10;were cousins in the neighborhood.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It&#39;s a glorious thing to live! glorious to get out of the&#10;well, and to lie among the stinging-nettles, and to crawl along the&#10;dusty road. But onward, onward! that we may find frogs or a little&#10;toad. We can&#39;t do without that; nature alone is not enough for&#10;one.&#34; And so she went forward on her journey.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;She came out into the open field, to a great pond, round&#10;about which grew reeds; and she walked into it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It will be too damp for you here,&#34; said the Frogs; &#34;but&#10;you are very welcome! Are you a he or a she? But it doesn&#39;t matter;&#10;you are equally welcome.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And she was invited to the concert in the evening&#8212;the&#10;family concert; great enthusiasm and thin voices; we know the sort&#10;of thing. No refreshments were given, only there was plenty to&#10;drink, for the whole pond was free.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Now I shall resume my journey,&#34; said the little Toad; for&#10;she always felt a longing for something better.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;She saw the stars shining, so large and so bright, and she&#10;saw the moon gleaming; and then she saw the sun rise, and mount&#10;higher and higher.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Perhaps after all, I am still in a well, only in a larger&#10;well. I must get higher yet; I feel a great restlessness and&#10;longing.&#34; And when the moon became round and full, the poor&#10;creature thought, &#34;I wonder if that is the bucket which will be let&#10;down, and into which I must step to get higher up? Or is the sun&#10;the great bucket? How great it is! how bright it is! It can take up&#10;all. I must look out, that I may not miss the opportunity. Oh, how&#10;it seems to shine in my head! I don&#39;t think the jewel can shine&#10;brighter. But I haven&#39;t the jewel; not that I cry about that&#8212;no, I&#10;must go higher up, into splendor and joy! I feel so confident, and&#10;yet I am afraid. It&#39;s a difficult step to take, and yet it must be&#10;taken. Onward, therefore, straight onward!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;She took a few steps, such as a crawling animal may take,&#10;and soon found herself on a road beside which people dwelt; but&#10;there were flower gardens as well as kitchen gardens. And she sat&#10;down to rest by a kitchen garden.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What a number of different creatures there are that I&#10;never knew! and how beautiful and great the world is! But one must&#10;look round in it, and not stay in one spot.&#34; And then she hopped&#10;into the kitchen garden. &#34;How green it is here! how beautiful it is&#10;here!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I know that,&#34; said the Caterpillar, on the leaf, &#34;my leaf&#10;is the largest here. It hides half the world from me, but I don&#39;t&#10;care for the world.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Cluck, cluck!&#34; And some fowls came. They tripped about in&#10;the cabbage garden. The Fowl who marched at the head of them had a&#10;long sight, and she spied the Caterpillar on the green leaf, and&#10;pecked at it, so that the Caterpillar fell on the ground, where it&#10;twisted and writhed.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Fowl looked at it first with one eye and then with the&#10;other, for she did not know what the end of this writhing would&#10;be.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It doesn&#39;t do that with a good will,&#34; thought the Fowl,&#10;and lifted up her head to peck at the Caterpillar.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Toad was so horrified at this, that she came crawling&#10;straight up towards the Fowl.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Aha, it has allies,&#34; quoth the Fowl. &#34;Just look at the&#10;crawling thing!&#34; And then the Fowl turned away. &#34;I don&#39;t care for&#10;the little green morsel; it would only tickle my throat.&#34; The other&#10;fowls took the same view of it, and they all turned away&#10;together.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I writhed myself free,&#34; said the Caterpillar. &#34;What a&#10;good thing it is when one has presence of mind! But the hardest&#10;thing remains to be done, and that is to get on my leaf again.&#10;Where is it?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the little Toad came up and expressed her sympathy.&#10;She was glad that in her ugliness she had frightened the&#10;fowls.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What do you mean by that?&#34; cried the Caterpillar. &#34;I&#10;wriggled myself free from the Fowl. You are very disagreeable to&#10;look at. Cannot I be left in peace on my own property? Now I smell&#10;cabbage; now I am near my leaf. Nothing is so beautiful as&#10;property. But I must go higher up.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, higher up,&#34; said the little Toad; &#34;higher-up! She&#10;feels just as I do; but she&#39;s not in a good humor to-day. That&#39;s&#10;because of the fright. We all want to go higher up.&#34; And she looked&#10;up as high as ever she could.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The stork sat in his nest on the roof of the farm-house.&#10;He clapped with his beak, and the Mother-stork clapped with&#10;hers.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;How high up they live!&#34; thought the Toad. &#34;If one could&#10;only get as high as that!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the farm-house lived two young students; the one was a&#10;poet and the other a scientific searcher into the secrets of&#10;nature. The one sang and wrote joyously of everything that God had&#10;created, and how it was mirrored in his heart. He sang it out&#10;clearly, sweetly, richly, in well-sounding verses; while the other&#10;investigated created matter itself, and even cut it open where need&#10;was. He looked upon God&#39;s creation as a great sum in&#10;arithmetic&#8212;subtracted, multiplied, and tried to know it within and&#10;without, and to talk with understanding concerning it; and that was&#10;a very sensible thing; and he spoke joyously and cleverly of it.&#10;They were good, joyful men, those two,&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;There sits a good specimen of a toad,&#34; said the&#10;naturalist. &#34;I must have that fellow in a bottle of&#10;spirits.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You have two of them already,&#34; replied the poet. &#34;Let the&#10;thing sit there and enjoy its life.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But it&#39;s so wonderfully ugly,&#34; persisted the&#10;first.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, if we could find the jewel in its head,&#34; said the&#10;poet, &#34;I too should be for cutting it open.&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;A jewel!&#34; cried the naturalist. &#34;You seem to know a great&#10;deal about natural history.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But is there not something beautiful in the popular&#10;belief that just as the toad is the ugliest of animals, it should&#10;often carry the most precious jewel in its head? Is it not just the&#10;same thing with men? What a jewel that was that Aesop had, and&#10;still more, Socrates!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Toad did not hear any more, nor did she understand&#10;half of what she had heard. The two friends walked on, and thus she&#10;escaped the fate of being bottled up in spirits.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Those two also were speaking of the jewel,&#34; said the Toad&#10;to herself. &#34;What a good thing that I have not got it! I might have&#10;been in a very disagreeable position.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Now there was a clapping on the roof of the farm-house.&#10;Father-Stork was making a speech to his family, and his family was&#10;glancing down at the two young men in the kitchen&#10;garden.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Man is the most conceited creature!&#34; said the Stork.&#10;&#34;Listen how their jaws are wagging; and for all that they can&#39;t&#10;clap properly. They boast of their gifts of eloquence and their&#10;language! Yes, a fine language truly! Why, it changes in every&#10;day&#39;s journey we make. One of them doesn&#39;t understand another. Now,&#10;we can speak our language over the whole earth&#8212;up in the North and&#10;in Egypt. And then men are not able to fly, moreover. They rush&#10;along by means of an invention they call &#39;railway;&#39; but they often&#10;break their necks over it. It makes my beak turn cold when I think&#10;of it. The world could get on without men. We could do without them&#10;very well, so long as we only keep frogs and&#10;earth-worms.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That was a powerful speech,&#34; thought the little Toad.&#10;&#34;What a great man that is yonder! and how high he sits! Higher than&#10;ever I saw any one sit yet; and how he can swim!&#34; she cried, as the&#10;Stork soared away through the air with outspread&#10;pinions.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the Mother-Stork began talking in the nest, and told&#10;about Egypt and the waters of the Nile, and the incomparable mud&#10;that was to be found in that strange land; and all this sounded new&#10;and very charming to the little Toad.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I must go to Egypt!&#34; said she. &#34;If the Stork or one of&#10;his young ones would only take me! I would oblige him in return.&#10;Yes, I shall get to Egypt, for I feel so happy! All the longing and&#10;all the pleasure that I feel is much better than having a jewel in&#10;one&#39;s head.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And it was just she who had the jewel. That jewel was the&#10;continual striving and desire to go upward&#8212;ever upward. It gleamed&#10;in her head, gleamed in joy, beamed brightly in her&#10;longing.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then, suddenly, up came the Stork. He had seen the Toad in&#10;the grass, and stooped down and seized the little creature anything&#10;but gently. The Stork&#39;s beak pinched her, and the wind whistled; it&#10;was not exactly agreeable, but she was going upward&#8212;upward towards&#10;Egypt&#8212;and she knew it; and that was why her eyes gleamed, and a&#10;spark seemed to fly out of them.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Quunk!&#8212;ah!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The body was dead&#8212;the Toad was killed! But the spark that&#10;had shot forth from her eyes; what became of that?&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The sunbeam took it up; the sunbeam carried the jewel from&#10;the head of the toad. Whither?&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Ask not the naturalist; rather ask the poet. He will tell&#10;it thee under the guise of a fairy tale; and the Caterpillar on the&#10;cabbage, and the Stork family belong to the story. Think! the&#10;Caterpillar is changed, and turns into a beautiful butterfly; the&#10;Stork family flies over mountains and seas, to the distant Africa,&#10;and yet finds the shortest way home to the same country&#8212;to the same&#10;roof. Nay, that is almost too improbable; and yet it is true. You&#10;may ask the naturalist, he will confess it is so; and you know it&#10;yourself, for you have seen it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But the jewel in the head of the toad?&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Seek it in the sun; see it there if you can.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The brightness is too dazzling there. We have not yet such&#10;eyes as can see into the glories which God has created, but we&#10;shall receive them by-and-by; and that will be the most beautiful&#10;story of all, and we shall all have our share in it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Story of the Wind'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;NEAR the shores of the great Belt, which is one of the&#10;straits that connect the Cattegat with the Baltic, stands an old&#10;mansion with thick red walls. I know every stone of it,&#34; says the&#10;Wind. &#34;I saw it when it was part of the castle of Marck Stig on the&#10;promontory. But the castle was obliged to be pulled down, and the&#10;stone was used again for the walls of a new mansion on another&#10;spot&#8212;the baronial residence of Borreby, which still stands near the&#10;coast. I knew them well, those noble lords and ladies, the&#10;successive generations that dwelt there; and now I&#39;m going to tell&#10;you of Waldemar Daa and his daughters. How proud was his bearing,&#10;for he was of royal blood, and could boast of more noble deeds than&#10;merely hunting the stag and emptying the wine-cup. His rule was&#10;despotic: &#39;It shall be,&#39; he was accustomed to say. His wife, in&#10;garments embroidered with gold, stepped proudly over the polished&#10;marble floors. The tapestries were gorgeous, and the furniture of&#10;costly and artistic taste. She had brought gold and plate with her&#10;into the house. The cellars were full of wine. Black, fiery horses,&#10;neighed in the stables. There was a look of wealth about the house&#10;of Borreby at that time. They had three children, daughters, fair&#10;and delicate maidens&#8212;Ida, Joanna, and Anna Dorothea; I have never&#10;forgotten their names. They were a rich, noble family, born in&#10;affluence and nurtured in luxury.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Whir-r-r, whir-r-r!&#34; roared the Wind, and went on, &#34;I did&#10;not see in this house, as in other great houses, the high-born lady&#10;sitting among her women, turning the spinning-wheel. She could&#10;sweep the sounding chords of the guitar, and sing to the music, not&#10;always Danish melodies, but the songs of a strange land. It was&#10;&#39;Live and let live,&#39; here. Stranger guests came from far and near,&#10;music sounded, goblets clashed, and I,&#34; said the Wind, &#34;was not&#10;able to drown the noise. Ostentation, pride, splendor, and display&#10;ruled, but not the fear of the Lord.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It was on the evening of the first day of May,&#34; the Wind&#10;continued, &#34;I came from the west, and had seen the ships&#10;overpowered with the waves, when all on board persisted or were&#10;cast shipwrecked on the coast of Jutland. I had hurried across the&#10;heath and over Jutland&#39;s wood-girt eastern coast, and over the&#10;island of Funen, and then I drove across the great belt, sighing&#10;and moaning. At length I lay down to rest on the shores of Zeeland,&#10;near to the great house of Borreby, where the splendid forest of&#10;oaks still flourished. The young men of the neighborhood were&#10;collecting branches and brushwood under the oak-trees. The largest&#10;and dryest they could find they carried into the village, and piled&#10;them up in a heap and set them on fire. Then the men and maidens&#10;danced, and sung in a circle round the blazing pile. I lay quite&#10;quiet,&#34; said the Wind, &#34;but I silently touched a branch which had&#10;been brought by one of the handsomest of the young men, and the&#10;wood blazed up brightly, blazed brighter than all the rest. Then he&#10;was chosen as the chief, and received the name of the Shepherd; and&#10;might choose his lamb from among the maidens. There was greater&#10;mirth and rejoicing than I had ever heard in the halls of the rich&#10;baronial house. Then the noble lady drove by towards the baron&#39;s&#10;mansion with her three daughters, in a gilded carriage drawn by six&#10;horses. The daughters were young and beautiful&#8212;three charming&#10;blossoms&#8212;a rose, a lily, and a white hyacinth. The mother was a&#10;proud tulip, and never acknowledged the salutations of any of the&#10;men or maidens who paused in their sport to do her honor. The&#10;gracious lady seemed like a flower that was rather stiff in the&#10;stalk. Rose, lily, and hyacinth&#8212;yes, I saw them all three. Whose&#10;little lambs will they one day become? thought I; their shepherd&#10;will be a gallant knight, perhaps a prince. The carriage rolled on,&#10;and the peasants resumed their dancing. They drove about the summer&#10;through all the villages near. But one night, when I rose again,&#10;the high-born lady lay down to rise again no more; that thing came&#10;to her which comes to us all, in which there is nothing new.&#10;Waldemar Daa remained for a time silent and thoughtful. &#39;The&#10;loftiest tree may be bowed without being broken,&#39; said a voice&#10;within him. His daughters wept; all the people in the mansion wiped&#10;their eyes, but Lady Daa had driven away, and I drove away too,&#34;&#10;said the Wind. &#34;Whir-r-r, whir-r-r-!&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I returned again; I often returned and passed over the&#10;island of Funen and the shores of the Belt. Then I rested by&#10;Borreby, near the glorious wood, where the heron made his nest, the&#10;haunt of the wood-pigeons, the blue-birds, and the black stork. It&#10;was yet spring, some were sitting on their eggs, others had already&#10;hatched their young broods; but how they fluttered about and cried&#10;out when the axe sounded through the forest, blow upon blow! The&#10;trees of the forest were doomed. Waldemar Daa wanted to build a&#10;noble ship, a man-of-war, a three-decker, which the king would be&#10;sure to buy; and these, the trees of the wood, the landmark of the&#10;seamen, the refuge of the birds, must be felled. The hawk started&#10;up and flew away, for its nest was destroyed; the heron and all the&#10;birds of the forest became homeless, and flew about in fear and&#10;anger. I could well understand how they felt. Crows and ravens&#10;croaked, as if in scorn, while the trees were cracking and falling&#10;around them. Far in the interior of the wood, where a noisy swarm&#10;of laborers were working, stood Waldemar Daa and his three&#10;daughters, and all were laughing at the wild cries of the birds,&#10;excepting one, the youngest, Anna Dorothea, who felt grieved to the&#10;heart; and when they made preparations to fell a tree that was&#10;almost dead, and on whose naked branches the black stork had built&#10;her nest, she saw the poor little things stretching out their&#10;necks, and she begged for mercy for them, with the tears in her&#10;eyes. So the tree with the black stork&#39;s nest was left standing;&#10;the tree itself, however, was not worth much to speak of. Then&#10;there was a great deal of hewing and sawing, and at last the&#10;three-decker was built. The builder was a man of low origin, but&#10;possessing great pride; his eyes and forehead spoke of large&#10;intellect, and Waldemar Daa was fond of listening to him, and so&#10;was Waldemar&#39;s daughter Ida, the eldest, now about fifteen years&#10;old; and while he was building the ship for the father, he was&#10;building for himself a castle in the air, in which he and Ida were&#10;to live when they were married. This might have happened, indeed,&#10;if there had been a real castle, with stone walls, ramparts, and a&#10;moat. But in spite of his clever head, the builder was still but a&#10;poor, inferior bird; and how can a sparrow expect to be admitted&#10;into the society of peacocks?&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I passed on in my course,&#34; said the Wind, &#34;and he passed&#10;away also. He was not allowed to remain, and little Ida got over&#10;it, because she was obliged to do so. Proud, black horses, worth&#10;looking at, were neighing in the stable. And they were locked up;&#10;for the admiral, who had been sent by the king to inspect the new&#10;ship, and make arrangements for its purchase, was loud in&#10;admiration of these beautiful horses. I heard it all,&#34; said the&#10;Wind, &#34;for I accompanied the gentlemen through the open door of the&#10;stable, and strewed stalks of straw, like bars of gold, at their&#10;feet. Waldemar Daa wanted gold, and the admiral wished for the&#10;proud black horses; therefore he praised them so much. But the hint&#10;was not taken, and consequently the ship was not bought. It&#10;remained on the shore covered with boards,&#8212;a Noah&#39;s ark that never&#10;got to the water&#8212;Whir-r-r-r&#8212;and that was a pity.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;In the winter, when the fields were covered with snow,&#10;and the water filled with large blocks of ice which I had blown up&#10;to the coast,&#34; continued the Wind, &#34;great flocks of crows and&#10;ravens, dark and black as they usually are, came and alighted on&#10;the lonely, deserted ship. Then they croaked in harsh accents of&#10;the forest that now existed no more, of the many pretty birds&#39;&#10;nests destroyed and the little ones left without a home; and all&#10;for the sake of that great bit of lumber, that proud ship, that&#10;never sailed forth. I made the snowflakes whirl till the snow lay&#10;like a great lake round the ship, and drifted over it. I let it&#10;hear my voice, that it might know what the storm has to say.&#10;Certainly I did my part towards teaching it seamanship.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That winter passed away, and another winter and summer&#10;both passed, as they are still passing away, even as I pass away.&#10;The snow drifts onwards, the apple-blossoms are scattered, the&#10;leaves fall,&#8212;everything passes away, and men are passing away too.&#10;But the great man&#39;s daughters are still young, and little Ida is a&#10;rose as fair to look upon as on the day when the shipbuilder first&#10;saw her. I often tumbled her long, brown hair, while she stood in&#10;the garden by the apple-tree, musing, and not heeding how I strewed&#10;the blossoms on her hair, and dishevelled it; or sometimes, while&#10;she stood gazing at the red sun and the golden sky through the&#10;opening branches of the dark, thick foliage of the garden trees.&#10;Her sister Joanna was bright and slender as a lily; she had a tall&#10;and lofty carriage and figure, though, like her mother, rather&#10;stiff in back. She was very fond of walking through the great hall,&#10;where hung the portraits of her ancestors. The women were&#10;represented in dresses of velvet and silk, with tiny little hats,&#10;embroidered with pearls, on their braided hair. They were all&#10;handsome women. The gentlemen appeared clad in steel, or in rich&#10;cloaks lined with squirrel&#39;s fur; they wore little ruffs, and&#10;swords at their sides. Where would Joanna&#39;s place be on that wall&#10;some day? and how would he look,&#8212;her noble lord and husband? This&#10;is what she thought of, and often spoke of in a low voice to&#10;herself. I heard it as I swept into the long hall, and turned round&#10;to come out again. Anna Dorothea, the pale hyacinth, a child of&#10;fourteen, was quiet and thoughtful; her large, deep, blue eyes had&#10;a dreamy look, but a childlike smile still played round her mouth.&#10;I was not able to blow it away, neither did I wish to do so. We&#10;have met in the garden, in the hollow lane, in the field and&#10;meadow, where she gathered herbs and flowers which she knew would&#10;be useful to her father in preparing the drugs and mixtures he was&#10;always concocting. Waldemar Daa was arrogant and proud, but he was&#10;also a learned man, and knew a great deal. It was no secret, and&#10;many opinions were expressed on what he did. In his fireplace there&#10;was a fire, even in summer time. He would lock himself in his room,&#10;and for days the fire would be kept burning; but he did not talk&#10;much of what he was doing. The secret powers of nature are&#10;generally discovered in solitude, and did he not soon expect to&#10;find out the art of making the greatest of all good things&#8212;the art&#10;of making gold? So he fondly hoped; therefore the chimney smoked&#10;and the fire crackled so constantly. Yes, I was there too,&#34; said&#10;the Wind. &#34;&#39;Leave it alone,&#39; I sang down the chimney; &#39;leave it&#10;alone, it will all end in smoke, air, coals, and ashes, and you&#10;will burn your fingers.&#39; But Waldemar Daa did not leave it alone,&#10;and all he possessed vanished like smoke blown by me. The splendid&#10;black horses, where are they? What became of the cows in the field,&#10;the old gold and silver vessels in cupboards and chests, and even&#10;the house and home itself? It was easy to melt all these away in&#10;the gold-making crucible, and yet obtain no gold. And so it was.&#10;Empty are the barns and store-rooms, the cellars and cupboards; the&#10;servants decreased in number, and the mice multiplied. First one&#10;window became broken, and then another, so that I could get in at&#10;other places besides the door. &#39;Where the chimney smokes, the meal&#10;is being cooked,&#39; says the proverb; but here a chimney smoked that&#10;devoured all the meals for the sake of gold. I blew round the&#10;courtyard,&#34; said the Wind, &#34;like a watchman blowing his home, but&#10;no watchman was there. I twirled the weather-cock round on the&#10;summit of the tower, and it creaked like the snoring of a warder,&#10;but no warder was there; nothing but mice and rats. Poverty laid&#10;the table-cloth; poverty sat in the wardrobe and in the larder. The&#10;door fell off its hinges, cracks and fissures made their appearance&#10;everywhere; so that I could go in and out at pleasure, and that is&#10;how I know all about it. Amid smoke and ashes, sorrow, and&#10;sleepless nights, the hair and beard of the master of the house&#10;turned gray, and deep furrows showed themselves around his temples;&#10;his skin turned pale and yellow, while his eyes still looked&#10;eagerly for gold, the longed-for gold, and the result of his labor&#10;was debt instead of gain. I blew the smoke and ashes into his face&#10;and beard; I moaned through the broken window-panes, and the&#10;yawning clefts in the walls; I blew into the chests and drawers&#10;belonging to his daughters, wherein lay the clothes that had become&#10;faded and threadbare, from being worn over and over again. Such a&#10;song had not been sung, at the children&#39;s cradle as I sung now. The&#10;lordly life had changed to a life of penury. I was the only one who&#10;rejoiced aloud in that castle,&#34; said the Wind. &#34;At last I snowed&#10;them up, and they say snow keeps people warm. It was good for them,&#10;for they had no wood, and the forest, from which they might have&#10;obtained it, had been cut down. The frost was very bitter, and I&#10;rushed through loop-holes and passages, over gables and roofs with&#10;keen and cutting swiftness. The three high-born daughters were&#10;lying in bed because of the cold, and their father crouching&#10;beneath his leather coverlet. Nothing to eat, nothing to burn, no&#10;fire on the hearth! Here was a life for high-born people! &#39;Give it&#10;up, give it up!&#39; But my Lord Daa would not do that. &#39;After winter,&#10;spring will come,&#39; he said, &#39;after want, good times. We must not&#10;lose patience, we must learn to wait. Now my horses and lands are&#10;all mortgaged, it is indeed high time; but gold will come at&#10;last&#8212;at Easter.&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I heard him as he thus spoke; he was looking at a&#10;spider&#39;s web, and he continued, &#39;Thou cunning little weaver, thou&#10;dost teach me perseverance. Let any one tear thy web, and thou wilt&#10;begin again and repair it. Let it be entirely destroyed, thou wilt&#10;resolutely begin to make another till it is completed. So ought we&#10;to do, if we wish to succeed at last.&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It was the morning of Easter-day. The bells sounded from&#10;the neighboring church, and the sun seemed to rejoice in the sky.&#10;The master of the castle had watched through the night, in feverish&#10;excitement, and had been melting and cooling, distilling and&#10;mixing. I heard him sighing like a soul in despair; I heard him&#10;praying, and I noticed how he held his breath. The lamp burnt out,&#10;but he did not observe it. I blew up the fire in the coals on the&#10;hearth, and it threw a red glow on his ghastly white face, lighting&#10;it up with a glare, while his sunken eyes looked out wildly from&#10;their cavernous depths, and appeared to grow larger and more&#10;prominent, as if they would burst from their sockets. &#39;Look at the&#10;alchymic glass,&#39; he cried; &#39;something glows in the crucible, pure&#10;and heavy.&#39; He lifted it with a trembling hand, and exclaimed in a&#10;voice of agitation, &#39;Gold! gold!&#39; He was quite giddy, I could have&#10;blown him down,&#34; said the Wind; &#34;but I only fanned the glowing&#10;coals, and accompanied him through the door to the room where his&#10;daughter sat shivering. His coat was powdered with ashes, and there&#10;were ashes in his beard and in his tangled hair. He stood erect,&#10;and held high in the air the brittle glass that contained his&#10;costly treasure. &#39;Found! found! Gold! gold!&#39; he shouted, again&#10;holding the glass aloft, that it might flash in the sunshine; but&#10;his hand trembled, and the alchymic glass fell from it, clattering&#10;to the ground, and brake in a thousand pieces. The last bubble of&#10;his happiness had burst, with a whiz and a whir, and I rushed away&#10;from the gold-maker&#39;s house.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Late in the autumn, when the days were short, and the&#10;mist sprinkled cold drops on the berries and the leafless branches,&#10;I came back in fresh spirits, rushed through the air, swept the sky&#10;clear, and snapped off the dry twigs, which is certainly no great&#10;labor to do, yet it must be done. There was another kind of&#10;sweeping taking place at Waldemar Daa&#39;s, in the castle of Borreby.&#10;His enemy, Owe Ramel, of Basnas, was there, with the mortgage of&#10;the house and everything it contained, in his pocket. I rattled the&#10;broken windows, beat against the old rotten doors, and whistled&#10;through cracks and crevices, so that Mr. Owe Ramel did not much&#10;like to remain there. Ida and Anna Dorothea wept bitterly, Joanna&#10;stood, pale and proud, biting her lips till the blood came; but&#10;what could that avail? Owe Ramel offered Waldemar Daa permission to&#10;remain in the house till the end of his life. No one thanked him&#10;for the offer, and I saw the ruined old gentleman lift his head,&#10;and throw it back more proudly than ever. Then I rushed against the&#10;house and the old lime-trees with such force, that one of the&#10;thickest branches, a decayed one, was broken off, and the branch&#10;fell at the entrance, and remained there. It might have been used&#10;as a broom, if any one had wanted to sweep the place out, and a&#10;grand sweeping-out there really was; I thought it would be so. It&#10;was hard for any one to preserve composure on such a day; but these&#10;people had strong wills, as unbending as their hard fortune. There&#10;was nothing they could call their own, excepting the clothes they&#10;wore. Yes, there was one thing more, an alchymist&#39;s glass, a new&#10;one, which had been lately bought, and filled with what could be&#10;gathered from the ground of the treasure which had promised so much&#10;but failed in keeping its promise. Waldemar Daa hid the glass in&#10;his bosom, and, taking his stick in his hand, the once rich&#10;gentleman passed with his daughters out of the house of Borreby. I&#10;blew coldly upon his flustered cheeks, I stroked his gray beard and&#10;his long white hair, and I sang as well as I was able, &#39;Whir-r-r,&#10;whir-r-r. Gone away! Gone away!&#39; Ida walked on one side of the old&#10;man, and Anna Dorothea on the other; Joanna turned round, as they&#10;left the entrance. Why? Fortune would not turn because she turned.&#10;She looked at the stone in the walls which had once formed part of&#10;the castle of Marck Stig, and perhaps she thought of his daughters&#10;and of the old song,&#8212;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The eldest and youngest, hand-in-hand,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Went forth alone to a distant land.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;These were only two; here there were three, and their&#10;father with them also. They walked along the high-road, where once&#10;they had driven in their splendid carriage; they went forth with&#10;their father as beggars. They wandered across an open field to a&#10;mud hut, which they rented for a dollar and a half a year, a new&#10;home, with bare walls and empty cupboards. Crows and magpies&#10;fluttered about them, and cried, as if in contempt, &#39;Caw, caw,&#10;turned out of our nest&#8212;caw, caw,&#39; as they had done in the wood at&#10;Borreby, when the trees were felled. Daa and his daughters could&#10;not help hearing it, so I blew about their ears to drown the noise;&#10;what use was it that they should listen? So they went to live in&#10;the mud hut in the open field, and I wandered away, over moor and&#10;meadow, through bare bushes and leafless forests, to the open sea,&#10;to the broad shores in other lands, &#39;Whir-r-r, whir-r-r! Away,&#10;away!&#39; year after year.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And what became of Waldemar Daa and his daughters? Listen;&#10;the Wind will tell us:&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The last I saw of them was the pale hyacinth, Anna&#10;Dorothea. She was old and bent then; for fifty years had passed and&#10;she had outlived them all. She could relate the history. Yonder, on&#10;the heath, near the town of Wiborg, in Jutland, stood the fine new&#10;house of the canon. It was built of red brick, with projecting&#10;gables. It was inhabited, for the smoke curled up thickly from the&#10;chimneys. The canon&#39;s gentle lady and her beautiful daughters sat&#10;in the bay-window, and looked over the hawthorn hedge of the garden&#10;towards the brown heath. What were they looking at? Their glances&#10;fell upon a stork&#39;s nest, which was built upon an old tumbledown&#10;hut. The roof, as far as one existed at all, was covered with moss&#10;and lichen. The stork&#39;s nest covered the greater part of it, and&#10;that alone was in a good condition; for it was kept in order by the&#10;stork himself. That is a house to be looked at, and not to be&#10;touched,&#34; said the Wind. &#34;For the sake of the stork&#39;s nest it had&#10;been allowed to remain, although it is a blot on the landscape.&#10;They did not like to drive the stork away; therefore the old shed&#10;was left standing, and the poor woman who dwelt in it allowed to&#10;stay. She had the Egyptian bird to thank for that; or was it&#10;perchance her reward for having once interceded for the&#10;preservation of the nest of its black brother in the forest of&#10;Borreby? At that time she, the poor woman, was a young child, a&#10;white hyacinth in a rich garden. She remembered that time well; for&#10;it was Anna Dorothea.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;O-h, o-h,&#39; she sighed; for people can sigh like the&#10;moaning of the wind among the reeds and rushes. &#39;O-h, o-h,&#39; she&#10;would say, &#39;no bell sounded at thy burial, Waldemar Daa. The poor&#10;school-boys did not even sing a psalm when the former lord of&#10;Borreby was laid in the earth to rest. O-h, everything has an end,&#10;even misery. Sister Ida became the wife of a peasant; that was the&#10;hardest trial which befell our father, that the husband of his own&#10;daughter should be a miserable serf, whom his owner could place for&#10;punishment on the wooden horse. I suppose he is under the ground&#10;now; and Ida&#8212;alas! alas! it is not ended yet; miserable that I am!&#10;Kind Heaven, grant me that I may die.&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That was Anna Dorothea&#39;s prayer in the wretched hut that&#10;was left standing for the sake of the stork. I took pity on the&#10;proudest of the sisters,&#34; said the Wind. &#34;Her courage was like that&#10;of a man; and in man&#39;s clothes she served as a sailor on board&#10;ship. She was of few words, and of a dark countenance; but she did&#10;not know how to climb, so I blew her overboard before any one found&#10;out that she was a woman; and, in my opinion, that was well done,&#34;&#10;said the Wind.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;On such another Easter morning as that on which Waldemar&#10;Daa imagined he had discovered the art of making gold, I heard the&#10;tones of a psalm under the stork&#39;s nest, and within the crumbling&#10;walls. It was Anna Dorothea&#39;s last song. There was no window in the&#10;hut, only a hole in the wall; and the sun rose like a globe of&#10;burnished gold, and looked through. With what splendor he filled&#10;that dismal dwelling! Her eyes were glazing, and her heart&#10;breaking; but so it would have been, even had the sun not shone&#10;that morning on Anna Dorothea. The stork&#39;s nest had secured her a&#10;home till her death. I sung over her grave; I sung at her father&#39;s&#10;grave. I know where it lies, and where her grave is too, but nobody&#10;else knows it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;New times now; all is changed. The old high-road is lost&#10;amid cultivated fields; the new one now winds along over covered&#10;graves; and soon the railway will come, with its train of&#10;carriages, and rush over graves where lie those whose very names&#10;are forgoten. All passed away, passed away!&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;This is the story of Waldemar Daa and his daughters. Tell&#10;it better, any of you, if you know how,&#34; said the Wind; and he&#10;rushed away, and was gone.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Story of the Year'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;IT was near the end of January, and a terrible fall of&#10;snow was pelting down, and whirling through the streets and lanes;&#10;the windows were plastered with snow on the outside, snow fell in&#10;masses from the roofs. Every one seemed in a great hurry; they ran,&#10;they flew, fell into each other&#39;s arms, holding fast for a moment&#10;as long as they could stand safely. Coaches and horses looked as if&#10;they had been frosted with sugar. The footmen stood with their&#10;backs against the carriages, so as to turn their faces from the&#10;wind. The foot passengers kept within the shelter of the carriages,&#10;which could only move slowly on in the deep snow. At last the storm&#10;abated, and a narrow path was swept clean in front of the houses;&#10;when two persons met in this path they stood still, for neither&#10;liked to take the first step on one side into the deep snow to let&#10;the other pass him. There they stood silent and motionless, till at&#10;last, as if by tacit consent, they each sacrificed a leg and buried&#10;it in the deep snow. Towards evening, the weather became calm. The&#10;sky, cleared from the snow, looked more lofty and transparent,&#10;while the stars shone with new brightness and purity. The frozen&#10;snow crackled under foot, and was quite firm enough to bear the&#10;sparrows, who hopped upon it in the morning dawn. They searched for&#10;food in the path which had been swept, but there was very little&#10;for them, and they were terribly cold. &#34;Tweet, tweet,&#34; said one to&#10;another; they call this a new year, but I think it is worse than&#10;the last. We might just as well have kept the old year; I&#39;m quite&#10;unhappy, and I have a right to be so.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, you have; and yet the people ran about and fired off&#10;guns, to usher in the new year,&#34; said a little shivering sparrow.&#10;&#34;They threw things against the doors, and were quite beside&#10;themselves with joy, because the old year had disappeared. I was&#10;glad too, for I expected we should have some warm days, but my&#10;hopes have come to nothing. It freezes harder than ever; I think&#10;mankind have made a mistake in reckoning time.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That they have,&#34; said a third, an old sparrow with a&#10;white poll; &#34;they have something they call a calendar; it&#39;s an&#10;invention of their own, and everything must be arranged according&#10;to it, but it won&#39;t do. When spring comes, then the year begins. It&#10;is the voice of nature, and I reckon by that.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But when will spring come?&#34; asked the others.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It will come when the stork returns, but he is very&#10;uncertain, and here in the town no one knows anything about it. In&#10;the country they have more knowledge; shall we fly away there and&#10;wait? we shall be nearer to spring then, certainly.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That may be all very well,&#34; said another sparrow, who had&#10;been hopping about for a long time, chirping, but not saying&#10;anything of consequence, &#34;but I have found a few comforts here in&#10;town which, I&#39;m afraid, I should miss out in the country. Here in&#10;this neighborhood, there lives a family of people who have been so&#10;sensible as to place three or four flower-pots against the wall in&#10;the court-yard, so that the openings are all turned inward, and the&#10;bottom of each points outward. In the latter a hole has been cut&#10;large enough for me to fly in and out. I and my husband have built&#10;a nest in one of these pots, and all our young ones, who have now&#10;flown away, were brought up there. The people who live there of&#10;course made the whole arrangement that they might have the pleasure&#10;of seeing us, or they would not have done it. It pleased them also&#10;to strew bread-crumbs for us, and so we have food, and may consider&#10;ourselves provided for. So I think my husband and I will stay where&#10;we are; although we are not very happy, but we shall&#10;stay.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And we will fly into the country,&#34; said the others, &#34;to&#10;see if spring is coming.&#34; And away they flew.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the country it was really winter, a few degrees colder&#10;than in the town. The sharp winds blew over the snow-covered&#10;fields. The farmer, wrapped in warm clothing, sat in his sleigh,&#10;and beat his arms across his chest to keep off the cold. The whip&#10;lay on his lap. The horses ran till they smoked. The snow crackled,&#10;the sparrows hopped about in the wheel-ruts, and shivered, crying,&#10;&#34;Tweet, tweet; when will spring come? It is very long in&#10;coming.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Very long indeed,&#34; sounded over the field, from the&#10;nearest snow-covered hill. It might have been the echo which people&#10;heard, or perhaps the words of that wonderful old man, who sat high&#10;on a heap of snow, regardless of wind or weather. He was all in&#10;white; he had on a peasant&#39;s coarse white coat of frieze. He had&#10;long white hair, a pale face, and large clear blue eyes. &#34;Who is&#10;that old man?&#34; asked the sparrows.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I know who he is,&#34; said an old raven, who sat on the&#10;fence, and was condescending enough to acknowledge that we are all&#10;equal in the sight of Heaven, even as little birds, and therefore&#10;he talked with the sparrows, and gave them the information they&#10;wanted. &#34;I know who the old man is,&#34; he said. &#34;It is Winter, the&#10;old man of last year; he is not dead yet, as the calendar says, but&#10;acts as guardian to little Prince Spring who is coming. Winter&#10;rules here still. Ugh! the cold makes you shiver, little ones, does&#10;it not?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;There! Did I not tell you so?&#34; said the smallest of the&#10;sparrows. &#34;The calendar is only an invention of man, and is not&#10;arranged according to nature. They should leave these things to us;&#10;we are created so much more clever than they are.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;One week passed, and then another. The forest looked dark,&#10;the hard-frozen lake lay like a sheet of lead. The mountains had&#10;disappeared, for over the land hung damp, icy mists. Large black&#10;crows flew about in silence; it was as if nature slept. At length a&#10;sunbeam glided over the lake, and it shone like burnished silver.&#10;But the snow on the fields and the hills did not glitter as before.&#10;The white form of Winter sat there still, with his un-wandering&#10;gaze fixed on the south. He did not perceive that the snowy carpet&#10;seemed to sink as it were into the earth; that here and there a&#10;little green patch of grass appeared, and that these patches were&#10;covered with sparrows.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Tee-wit, tee-wit; is spring coming at last?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Spring! How the cry resounded over field and meadow, and&#10;through the dark-brown woods, where the fresh green moss still&#10;gleamed on the trunks of the trees, and from the south came the two&#10;first storks flying through the air, and on the back of each sat a&#10;lovely little child, a boy and a girl. They greeted the earth with&#10;a kiss, and wherever they placed their feet white flowers sprung up&#10;from beneath the snow. Hand in hand they approached the old&#10;ice-man, Winter, embraced him and clung to his breast; and as they&#10;did so, in a moment all three were enveloped in a thick, damp mist,&#10;dark and heavy, that closed over them like a veil. The wind arose&#10;with mighty rustling tone, and cleared away the mist. Then the sun&#10;shone out warmly. Winter had vanished away, and the beautiful&#10;children of Spring sat on the throne of the year.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;This is really a new year,&#34; cried all the sparrows, &#34;now&#10;we shall get our rights, and have some return for what we suffered&#10;in winter.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Wherever the two children wandered, green buds burst forth&#10;on bush and tree, the grass grew higher, and the corn-fields became&#10;lovely in delicate green.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The little maiden strewed flowers in her path. She held&#10;her apron before her: it was full of flowers; it was as if they&#10;sprung into life there, for the more she scattered around her, the&#10;more flowers did her apron contain. Eagerly she showered snowy&#10;blossoms over apple and peach-trees, so that they stood in full&#10;beauty before even their green leaves had burst from the bud. Then&#10;the boy and the girl clapped their hands, and troops of birds came&#10;flying by, no one knew from whence, and they all twittered and&#10;chirped, singing &#34;Spring has come!&#34; How beautiful everything was!&#10;Many an old dame came forth from her door into the sunshine, and&#10;shuffled about with great delight, glancing at the golden flowers&#10;which glittered everywhere in the fields, as they used to do in her&#10;young days. The world grew young again to her, as she said, &#34;It is&#10;a blessed time out here to-day.&#34; The forest already wore its dress&#10;of dark-green buds. The thyme blossomed in fresh fragrance.&#10;Primroses and anemones sprung forth, and violets bloomed in the&#10;shade, while every blade of grass was full of strength and sap. Who&#10;could resist sitting down on such a beautiful carpet? and then the&#10;young children of Spring seated themselves, holding each other&#39;s&#10;hands, and sang, and laughed, and grew. A gentle rain fell upon&#10;them from the sky, but they did not notice it, for the rain-drops&#10;were their own tears of joy. They kissed each other, and were&#10;betrothed; and in the same moment the buds of the trees unfolded,&#10;and when the sun rose, the forest was green. Hand in hand the two&#10;wandered beneath the fresh pendant canopy of foliage, while the&#10;sun&#39;s rays gleamed through the opening of the shade, in changing&#10;and varied colors. The delicate young leaves filled the air with&#10;refreshing odor. Merrily rippled the clear brooks and rivulets&#10;between the green, velvety rushes, and over the many-colored&#10;pebbles beneath. All nature spoke of abundance and plenty. The&#10;cuckoo sang, and the lark carolled, for it was now beautiful&#10;spring. The careful willows had, however, covered their blossoms&#10;with woolly gloves; and this carefulness is rather tedious. Days&#10;and weeks went by, and the heat increased. Warm air waved the corn&#10;as it grew golden in the sun. The white northern lily spread its&#10;large green leaves over the glossy mirror of the woodland lake, and&#10;the fishes sought the shadows beneath them. In a sheltered part of&#10;the wood, the sun shone upon the walls of a farm-house, brightening&#10;the blooming roses, and ripening the black juicy berries, which&#10;hung on the loaded cherry-trees, with his hot beams. Here sat the&#10;lovely wife of Summer, the same whom we have seen as a child and a&#10;bride; her eyes were fixed on dark gathering clouds, which in wavy&#10;outlines of black and indigo were piling themselves up like&#10;mountains, higher and higher. They came from every side, always&#10;increasing like a rising, rolling sea. Then they swooped towards&#10;the forest, where every sound had been silenced as if by magic,&#10;every breath hushed, every bird mute. All nature stood still in&#10;grave suspense. But in the lanes and the highways, passengers on&#10;foot or in carriages were hurrying to find a place of shelter. Then&#10;came a flash of light, as if the sun had rushed forth from the sky,&#10;flaming, burning, all-devouring, and darkness returned amid a&#10;rolling crash of thunder. The rain poured down in streams,&#8212;now&#10;there was darkness, then blinding light,&#8212;now thrilling silence,&#10;then deafening din. The young brown reeds on the moor waved to and&#10;fro in feathery billows; the forest boughs were hidden in a watery&#10;mist, and still light and darkness followed each other, still came&#10;the silence after the roar, while the corn and the blades of grass&#10;lay beaten down and swamped, so that it seemed impossible they&#10;could ever raise themselves again. But after a while the rain began&#10;to fall gently, the sun&#39;s rays pierced the clouds, and the&#10;water-drops glittered like pearls on leaf and stem. The birds sang,&#10;the fishes leaped up to the surface of the water, the gnats danced&#10;in the sunshine, and yonder, on a rock by the heaving salt sea, sat&#10;Summer himself, a strong man with sturdy limbs and long, dripping&#10;hair. Strengthened by the cool bath, he sat in the warm sunshine,&#10;while all around him renewed nature bloomed strong, luxuriant, and&#10;beautiful: it was summer, warm, lovely summer. Sweet and pleasant&#10;was the fragrance wafted from the clover-field, where the bees&#10;swarmed round the ruined tower, the bramble twined itself over the&#10;old altar, which, washed by the rain, glittered in the sunshine;&#10;and thither flew the queen bee with her swarm, and prepared wax and&#10;honey. But Summer and his bosom-wife saw it with different eyes, to&#10;them the altar-table was covered with the offerings of nature. The&#10;evening sky shone like gold, no church dome could ever gleam so&#10;brightly, and between the golden evening and the blushing morning&#10;there was moonlight. It was indeed summer. And days and weeks&#10;passed, the bright scythes of the reapers glittered in the&#10;corn-fields, the branches of the apple-trees bent low, heavy with&#10;the red and golden fruit. The hop, hanging in clusters, filled the&#10;air with sweet fragrance, and beneath the hazel-bushes, where the&#10;nuts hung in great bunches, rested a man and a woman&#8212;Summer and his&#10;grave consort.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;See,&#34; she exclaimed, &#34;what wealth, what blessings&#10;surround us. Everything is home-like and good, and yet, I know not&#10;why, I long for rest and peace; I can scarcely express what I feel.&#10;They are already ploughing the fields again; more and more the&#10;people wish for gain. See, the storks are flocking together, and&#10;following the plough at a short distance. They are the birds from&#10;Egypt, who carried us through the air. Do you remember how we came&#10;as children to this land of the north; we brought with us flowers&#10;and bright sunshine, and green to the forests, but the wind has&#10;been rough with them, and they are now become dark and brown, like&#10;the trees of the south, but they do not, like them, bear golden&#10;fruit.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Do you wish to see golden fruit?&#34; said the man, &#34;then&#10;rejoice,&#34; and he lifted his arm. The leaves of the forest put on&#10;colors of red and gold, and bright tints covered the woodlands. The&#10;rose-bushes gleamed with scarlet hips, and the branches of the&#10;elder-trees hung down with the weight of the full, dark berries.&#10;The wild chestnuts fell ripe from their dark, green shells, and in&#10;the forests the violets bloomed for the second time. But the queen&#10;of the year became more and more silent and pale.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It blows cold,&#34; she said, &#34;and night brings the damp&#10;mist; I long for the land of my childhood.&#34; Then she saw the storks&#10;fly away every one, and she stretched out her hands towards them.&#10;She looked at the empty nests; in one of them grew a long-stalked&#10;corn flower, in another the yellow mustard seed, as if the nest had&#10;been placed there only for its comfort and protection, and the&#10;sparrows were flying round them all.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Tweet, where has the master of the nest gone?&#34; cried one,&#10;&#34;I suppose he could not bear it when the wind blew, and therefore&#10;he has left this country. I wish him a pleasant&#10;journey.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The forest leaves became more and more yellow, leaf after&#10;leaf fell, and the stormy winds of Autumn howled. The year was now&#10;far advanced, and upon the fallen, yellow leaves, lay the queen of&#10;the year, looking up with mild eyes at a gleaming star, and her&#10;husband stood by her. A gust of wind swept through the foliage, and&#10;the leaves fell in a shower. The summer queen was gone, but a&#10;butterfly, the last of the year, flew through the cold air. Damp&#10;fogs came, icy winds blew, and the long, dark nights of winter&#10;approached. The ruler of the year appeared with hair white as snow,&#10;but he knew it not; he thought snow-flakes falling from the sky&#10;covered his head, as they decked the green fields with a thin,&#10;white covering of snow. And then the church bells rang out for&#10;Christmas time.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The bells are ringing for the new-born year,&#34; said the&#10;ruler, &#34;soon will a new ruler and his bride be born, and. I shall&#10;go to rest with my wife in yonder light-giving star.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the fresh, green fir-wood, where the snow lay all&#10;around, stood the angel of Christmas, and consecrated the young&#10;trees that were to adorn his feast.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;May there be joy in the rooms, and under the green&#10;boughs,&#34; said the old ruler of the year. In a few weeks he had&#10;become a very old man, with hair as white as snow. &#34;My resting-time&#10;draws near; the young pair of the year will soon claim my crown and&#10;sceptre.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But the night is still thine,&#34; said the angel of&#10;Christmas, &#34;for power, but not for rest. Let the snow lie warmly&#10;upon the tender seed. Learn to endure the thought that another is&#10;worshipped whilst thou art still lord. Learn to endure being&#10;forgotten while yet thou livest. The hour of thy freedom will come&#10;when Spring appears.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And when will Spring come?&#34; asked Winter.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It will come when the stork returns.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And with white locks and snowy beard, cold, bent, and&#10;hoary, but strong as the wintry storm, and firm as the ice, old&#10;Winter sat on the snowdrift-covered hill, looking towards the&#10;south, where Winter had sat before, and gazed. The ice glittered,&#10;the snow crackled, the skaters skimmed over the polished surface of&#10;the lakes; ravens and crows formed a pleasing contrast to the white&#10;ground, and not a breath of wind stirred, and in the still air old&#10;Winter clenched his fists, and the ice lay fathoms deep between the&#10;lands. Then came the sparrows again out of the town, and asked,&#10;&#34;Who is that old man?&#34; The raven sat there still, or it might be&#10;his son, which is the same thing, and he said to them,&#8212;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It is Winter, the old man of the former year; he is not&#10;dead, as the calendar says, but he is guardian to the spring, which&#10;is coming.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;When will Spring come?&#34; asked the sparrows, &#34;for we shall&#10;have better times then, and a better rule. The old times are worth&#10;nothing.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And in quiet thought old Winter looked at the leafless&#10;forest, where the graceful form and bends of each tree and branch&#10;could be seen; and while Winter slept, icy mists came from the&#10;clouds, and the ruler dreamt of his youthful days and of his&#10;manhood, and in the morning dawn the whole forest glittered with&#10;hoar frost, which the sun shook from the branches,&#8212;and this was the&#10;summer dream of Winter.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;When will Spring come?&#34; asked the sparrows. &#34;Spring!&#34;&#10;Again the echo sounded from the hills on which the snow lay. The&#10;sunshine became warmer, the snow melted, and the birds twittered,&#10;&#34;Spring is coming!&#34; And high in the air flew the first stork, and&#10;the second followed; a lovely child sat on the back of each, and&#10;they sank down on the open field, kissed the earth, and kissed the&#10;quiet old man; and, as the mist from the mountain top, he vanished&#10;away and disappeared. And the story of the year was&#10;finished.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;This is all very fine, no doubt,&#34; said the sparrows, &#34;and&#10;it is very beautiful; but it is not according to the calendar,&#10;therefore, it must be all wrong.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)

Nobody&#10;looked at it, except the old Ass which drew the milk-maid&#39;s cart.&#10;This Ass used to stretch out his neck towards the Thistle, and say,&#10;&#34;You are beautiful; I should like to eat you!&#34; But his halter was&#10;not long enough to let him reach it and eat it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;There was great company at the manor-house&#8212;some very noble&#10;people from the capital; young pretty girls, and among them a young&#10;lady who came from a long distance. She had come from Scotland, and&#10;was of high birth, and was rich in land and in gold&#8212;a bride worth&#10;winning, said more than one of the young gentlemen; and their lady&#10;mothers said the same thing.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The young people amused themselves on the lawn, and played&#10;at ball; they wandered among the flowers, and each of the young&#10;girls broke off a flower, and fastened it in a young gentleman&#39;s&#10;buttonhole. But the young Scotch lady looked round, for a long&#10;time, in an undecided way. None of the flowers seemed to suit her&#10;taste. Then her eye glanced across the paling&#8212;outside stood the&#10;great thistle bush, with the reddish-blue, sturdy flowers; she saw&#10;them, she smiled, and asked the son of the house to pluck one for&#10;her.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It is the flower of Scotland,&#34; she said. &#34;It blooms in&#10;the scutcheon of my country. Give me yonder flower.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And he brought the fairest blossom, and pricked his&#10;fingers as completely as if it had grown on the sharpest rose&#10;bush.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;She placed the thistle-flower in the buttonhole of the&#10;young man, and he felt himself highly honored. Each of the other&#10;young gentlemen would willingly have given his own beautiful flower&#10;to have worn this one, presented by the fair hand of the Scottish&#10;maiden. And if the son of the house felt himself honored, what were&#10;the feelings of the Thistle bush? It seemed to him as if dew and&#10;sunshine were streaming through him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I am something more than I knew of,&#34; said the Thistle to&#10;itself. &#34;I suppose my right place is really inside the palings, and&#10;not outside. One is often strangely placed in this world; but now I&#10;have at least managed to get one of my people within the pale, and&#10;indeed into a buttonhole!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The Thistle told this event to every blossom that unfolded&#10;itself, and not many days had gone by before the Thistle heard, not&#10;from men, not from the twittering of the birds, but from the air&#10;itself, which stores up the sounds, and carries them far around&#8212;out&#10;of the most retired walks of the garden, and out of the rooms of&#10;the house, in which doors and windows stood open, that the young&#10;gentleman who had received the thistle-flower from the hand of the&#10;fair Scottish maiden had also now received the heart and hand of&#10;the lady in question. They were a handsome pair&#8212;it was a good&#10;match.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That match I made up!&#34; said the Thistle; and he thought&#10;of the flower he had given for the buttonhole. Every flower that&#10;opened heard of this occurrence.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I shall certainly be transplanted into the garden,&#34;&#10;thought the Thistle, and perhaps put into a pot, which crowds one&#10;in. That is said to be the greatest of all honors.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the Thistle pictured this to himself in such a lively&#10;manner, that at last he said, with full conviction, &#34;I am to be&#10;transplanted into a pot.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then he promised every little thistle flower which&#10;unfolded itself that it also should be put into a pot, and perhaps&#10;into a buttonhole, the highest honor that could be attained. But&#10;not one of them was put into a pot, much less into a buttonhole.&#10;They drank in the sunlight and the air; lived on the sunlight by&#10;day, and on the dew by night; bloomed&#8212;were visited by bees and&#10;hornets, who looked after the honey, the dowry of the flower, and&#10;they took the honey, and left the flower where it was.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The thievish rabble!&#34; said the Thistle. &#34;If I could only&#10;stab every one of them! But I cannot.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The flowers hung their heads and faded; but after a time&#10;new ones came.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You come in good time,&#34; said the Thistle. &#34;I am expecting&#10;every moment to get across the fence.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A few innocent daisies, and a long thin dandelion, stood&#10;and listened in deep admiration, and believed everything they&#10;heard.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The old Ass of the milk-cart stood at the edge of the&#10;field-road, and glanced across at the blooming thistle bush; but&#10;his halter was too short, and he could not reach it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the Thistle thought so long of the thistle of&#10;Scotland, to whose family he said he belonged, that he fancied at&#10;last that he had come from Scotland, and that his parents had been&#10;put into the national escutcheon. That was a great thought; but,&#10;you see, a great thistle has a right to a great thought.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;One is often of so grand a family, that one may not know&#10;it,&#34; said the Nettle, who grew close by. He had a kind of idea that&#10;he might be made into cambric if he were rightly&#10;treated.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the summer went by, and the autumn went by. The leaves&#10;fell from the trees, and the few flowers left had deeper colors and&#10;less scent. The gardener&#39;s boy sang in the garden, across the&#10;palings:&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Up the hill, down the dale we wend,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;That is life, from beginning to end.&#34;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The young fir trees in the forest began to long for&#10;Christmas, but it was a long time to Christmas yet.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Here I am standing yet!&#34; said the Thistle. &#34;It is as if&#10;nobody thought of me, and yet I managed the match. They were&#10;betrothed, and they have had their wedding; it is now a week ago. I&#10;won&#39;t take a single step-because I can&#39;t.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A few more weeks went by. The Thistle stood there with his&#10;last single flower large and full. This flower had shot up from&#10;near the roots; the wind blew cold over it, and the colors&#10;vanished, and the flower grew in size, and looked like a silvered&#10;sunflower.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;One day the young pair, now man and wife, came into the&#10;garden. They went along by the paling, and the young wife looked&#10;across it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;There&#39;s the great thistle still growing,&#34; she said. &#34;It&#10;has no flowers now.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, yes, the ghost of the last one is there still,&#34; said&#10;he. And he pointed to the silvery remains of the flower, which&#10;looked like a flower themselves.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It is pretty, certainly,&#34; she said. &#34;Such an one must be&#10;carved on the frame of our picture.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the young man had to climb across the palings again,&#10;and to break off the calyx of the thistle. It pricked his fingers,&#10;but then he had called it a ghost. And this thistle-calyx came into&#10;the garden, and into the house, and into the drawing-room. There&#10;stood a picture&#8212;&#34;Young Couple.&#34; A thistle-flower was painted in the&#10;buttonhole of the bridegroom. They spoke about this, and also about&#10;the thistle-flower they brought, the last thistle-flower, now&#10;gleaming like silver, whose picture was carved on the&#10;frame.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the breeze carried what was spoken away, far&#10;away.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What one can experience!&#34; said the Thistle Bush. &#34;My&#10;first born was put into a buttonhole, and my youngest has been put&#10;in a frame. Where shall I go?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the Ass stood by the road-side, and looked across at&#10;the Thistle.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Come to me, my nibble darling!&#34; said he. &#34;I can&#39;t get&#10;across to you.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But the Thistle did not answer. He became more and more&#10;thoughtful&#8212;kept on thinking and thinking till near Christmas, and&#10;then a flower of thought came forth.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;If the children are only good, the parents do not mind&#10;standing outside the garden pale.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That&#39;s an honorable thought,&#34; said the Sunbeam. &#34;You&#10;shall also have a good place.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;In a pot or in a frame?&#34; asked the Thistle.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;In a story,&#34; replied the Sunbeam.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Thorny Road of Honor'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;AN old story yet lives of the &#34;Thorny Road of Honor,&#34; of a&#10;marksman, who indeed attained to rank and office, but only after a&#10;lifelong and weary strife against difficulties. Who has not, in&#10;reading this story, thought of his own strife, and of his own&#10;numerous &#34;difficulties?&#34; The story is very closely akin to reality;&#10;but still it has its harmonious explanation here on earth, while&#10;reality often points beyond the confines of life to the regions of&#10;eternity. The history of the world is like a magic lantern that&#10;displays to us, in light pictures upon the dark ground of the&#10;present, how the benefactors of mankind, the martyrs of genius,&#10;wandered along the thorny road of honor.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;From all periods, and from every country, these shining&#10;pictures display themselves to us. Each only appears for a few&#10;moments, but each represents a whole life, sometimes a whole age,&#10;with its conflicts and victories. Let us contemplate here and there&#10;one of the company of martyrs&#8212;the company which will receive new&#10;members until the world itself shall pass away.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;We look down upon a crowded amphitheatre. Out of the&#10;&#34;Clouds&#34; of Aristophanes, satire and humor are pouring down in&#10;streams upon the audience; on the stage Socrates, the most&#10;remarkable man in Athens, he who had been the shield and defence of&#10;the people against the thirty tyrants, is held up mentally and&#10;bodily to ridicule&#8212;Socrates, who saved Alcibiades and Xenophon in&#10;the turmoil of battle, and whose genius soared far above the gods&#10;of the ancients. He himself is present; he has risen from the&#10;spectator&#39;s bench, and has stepped forward, that the laughing&#10;Athenians may well appreciate the likeness between himself and the&#10;caricature on the stage. There he stands before them, towering high&#10;above them all.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Thou juicy, green, poisonous hemlock, throw thy shadow&#10;over Athens&#8212;not thou, olive tree of fame!&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Seven cities contended for the honor of giving birth to&#10;Homer&#8212;that is to say, they contended after his death! Let us look&#10;at him as he was in his lifetime. He wanders on foot through the&#10;cities, and recites his verses for a livelihood; the thought for&#10;the morrow turns his hair gray! He, the great seer, is blind, and&#10;painfully pursues his way&#8212;the sharp thorn tears the mantle of the&#10;king of poets. His song yet lives, and through that alone live all&#10;the heroes and gods of antiquity.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;One picture after another springs up from the east, from&#10;the west, far removed from each other in time and place, and yet&#10;each one forming a portion of the thorny road of honor, on which&#10;the thistle indeed displays a flower, but only to adorn the&#10;grave.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The camels pass along under the palm trees; they are&#10;richly laden with indigo and other treasures of value, sent by the&#10;ruler of the land to him whose songs are the delight of the people,&#10;the fame of the country. He whom envy and falsehood have driven&#10;into exile has been found, and the caravan approaches the little&#10;town in which he has taken refuge. A poor corpse is carried out of&#10;the town gate, and the funeral procession causes the caravan to&#10;halt. The dead man is he whom they have been sent to&#10;seek&#8212;Firdusi&#8212;who has wandered the Thorny road of honor even to the&#10;end.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The African, with blunt features, thick lips, and woolly&#10;hair, sits on the marble steps of the palace in the capital of&#10;Portugal, and begs. He is the submissive slave of Camoens, and but&#10;for him, and for the copper coins thrown to him by the passers-by,&#10;his master, the poet of the &#34;Lusiad,&#34; would die of hunger. Now, a&#10;costly monument marks the grave of Camoens.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;There is a new picture.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Behind the iron grating a man appears, pale as death, with&#10;long unkempt beard.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I have made a discovery,&#34; he says, &#34;the greatest that has&#10;been made for centuries; and they have kept me locked up here for&#10;more than twenty years!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Who is the man?&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;A madman,&#34; replies the keeper of the madhouse. &#34;What&#10;whimsical ideas these lunatics have! He imagines that one can&#10;propel things by means of steam.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It is Solomon de Cares, the discoverer of the power of&#10;steam, whose theory, expressed in dark words, is not understood by&#10;Richelieu; and he dies in the madhouse.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Here stands Columbus, whom the street boys used once to&#10;follow and jeer, because he wanted to discover a new world; and he&#10;has discovered it. Shouts of joy greet him from the breasts of all,&#10;and the clash of bells sounds to celebrate his triumphant return;&#10;but the clash of the bells of envy soon drowns the others. The&#10;discoverer of a world&#8212;he who lifted the American gold land from the&#10;sea, and gave it to his king&#8212;he is rewarded with iron chains. He&#10;wishes that these chains may be placed in his coffin, for they&#10;witness to the world of the way in which a man&#39;s contemporaries&#10;reward good service.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;One picture after another comes crowding on; the thorny&#10;path of honor and of fame is over-filled.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Here in dark night sits the man who measured the mountains&#10;in the moon; he who forced his way out into the endless space,&#10;among stars and planets; he, the mighty man who understood the&#10;spirit of nature, and felt the earth moving beneath his&#10;feet&#8212;Galileo. Blind and deaf he sits&#8212;an old man thrust through with&#10;the spear of suffering, and amid the torments of neglect, scarcely&#10;able to lift his foot&#8212;that foot with which, in the anguish of his&#10;soul, when men denied the truth, he stamped upon the ground, with&#10;the exclamation, &#34;Yet it moves!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Here stands a woman of childlike mind, yet full of faith&#10;and inspiration. She carries the banner in front of the combating&#10;army, and brings victory and salvation to her fatherland. The sound&#10;of shouting arises, and the pile flames up. They are burning the&#10;witch, Joan of Arc. Yes, and a future century jeers at the White&#10;Lily. Voltaire, the satyr of human intellect, writes &#34;La&#10;Pucelle.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;At the Thing or Assembly at Viborg, the Danish nobles burn&#10;the laws of the king. They flame up high, illuminating the period&#10;and the lawgiver, and throw a glory into the dark prison tower,&#10;where an old man is growing gray and bent. With his finger he marks&#10;out a groove in the stone table. It is the popular king who sits&#10;there, once the ruler of three kingdoms, the friend of the citizen&#10;and the peasant. It is Christian the Second. Enemies wrote his&#10;history. Let us remember his improvements of seven and twenty&#10;years, if we cannot forget his crime.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A ship sails away, quitting the Danish shores. A man leans&#10;against the mast, casting a last glance towards the Island Hueen.&#10;It is Tycho Brahe. He raised the name of Denmark to the stars, and&#10;was rewarded with injury, loss and sorrow. He is going to a strange&#10;country.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The vault of heaven is above me everywhere,&#34; he says,&#10;&#34;and what do I want more?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And away sails the famous Dane, the astronomer, to live&#10;honored and free in a strange land.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ay, free, if only from the unbearable sufferings of the&#10;body!&#34; comes in a sigh through time, and strikes upon our ear. What&#10;a picture! Griffenfeldt, a Danish Prometheus, bound to the rocky&#10;island of Munkholm.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;We are in America, on the margin of one of the largest&#10;rivers; an innumerable crowd has gathered, for it is said that a&#10;ship is to sail against the wind and weather, bidding defiance to&#10;the elements. The man who thinks he can solve the problem is named&#10;Robert Fulton. The ship begins its passage, but suddenly it stops.&#10;The crowd begins to laugh and whistle and hiss&#8212;the very father of&#10;the man whistles with the rest.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Conceit! Foolery!&#34; is the cry. &#34;It has happened just as&#10;he deserved. Put the crack-brain under lock and key!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then suddenly a little nail breaks, which had stopped the&#10;machine for a few moments; and now the wheels turn again, the&#10;floats break the force of the waters, and the ship continues its&#10;course; and the beam of the steam engine shortens the distance&#10;between far lands from hours into minutes.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;O human race, canst thou grasp the happiness of such a&#10;minute of consciousness, this penetration of the soul by its&#10;mission, the moment in which all dejection, and every wound&#8212;even&#10;those caused by one&#39;s own fault&#8212;is changed into health and strength&#10;and clearness&#8212;when discord is converted to harmony&#8212;the minute in&#10;which men seem to recognize the manifestation of the heavenly grace&#10;in one man, and feel how this one imparts it to all?&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Thus the thorny path of honor shows itself as a glory,&#10;surrounding the earth with its beams. Thrice happy he who is chosen&#10;to be a wanderer there, and, without merit of his own, to be placed&#10;between the builder of the bridge and the earth&#8212;between Providence&#10;and the human race.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;On mighty wings the spirit of history floats through the&#10;ages, and shows&#8212;giving courage and comfort, and awakening gentle&#10;thoughts&#8212;on the dark nightly background, but in gleaming pictures,&#10;the thorny path of honor, which does not, like a fairy tale, end in&#10;brilliancy and joy here on earth, but stretches out beyond all&#10;time, even into eternity!&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)

Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Brave Tin Soldier'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;THERE were once five-and-twenty tin soldiers, who were all&#10;brothers, for they had been made out of the same old tin spoon.&#10;They shouldered arms and looked straight before them, and wore a&#10;splendid uniform, red and blue. The first thing in the world they&#10;ever heard were the words, &#34;Tin soldiers!&#34; uttered by a little boy,&#10;who clapped his hands with delight when the lid of the box, in&#10;which they lay, was taken off. They were given him for a birthday&#10;present, and he stood at the table to set them up. The soldiers&#10;were all exactly alike, excepting one, who had only one leg; he had&#10;been left to the last, and then there was not enough of the melted&#10;tin to finish him, so they made him to stand firmly on one leg, and&#10;this caused him to be very remarkable.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The table on which the tin soldiers stood, was covered&#10;with other playthings, but the most attractive to the eye was a&#10;pretty little paper castle. Through the small windows the rooms&#10;could be seen. In front of the castle a number of little trees&#10;surrounded a piece of looking-glass, which was intended to&#10;represent a transparent lake. Swans, made of wax, swam on the lake,&#10;and were reflected in it. All this was very pretty, but the&#10;prettiest of all was a tiny little lady, who stood at the open door&#10;of the castle; she, also, was made of paper, and she wore a dress&#10;of clear muslin, with a narrow blue ribbon over her shoulders just&#10;like a scarf. In front of these was fixed a glittering tinsel rose,&#10;as large as her whole face. The little lady was a dancer, and she&#10;stretched out both her arms, and raised one of her legs so high,&#10;that the tin soldier could not see it at all, and he thought that&#10;she, like himself, had only one leg. &#34;That is the wife for me,&#34; he&#10;thought; &#34;but she is too grand, and lives in a castle, while I have&#10;only a box to live in, five-and-twenty of us altogether, that is no&#10;place for her. Still I must try and make her acquaintance.&#34; Then he&#10;laid himself at full length on the table behind a snuff-box that&#10;stood upon it, so that he could peep at the little delicate lady,&#10;who continued to stand on one leg without losing her balance. When&#10;evening came, the other tin soldiers were all placed in the box,&#10;and the people of the house went to bed. Then the playthings began&#10;to have their own games together, to pay visits, to have sham&#10;fights, and to give balls. The tin soldiers rattled in their box;&#10;they wanted to get out and join the amusements, but they could not&#10;open the lid. The nut-crackers played at leap-frog, and the pencil&#10;jumped about the table. There was such a noise that the canary woke&#10;up and began to talk, and in poetry too. Only the tin soldier and&#10;the dancer remained in their places. She stood on tiptoe, with her&#10;legs stretched out, as firmly as he did on his one leg. He never&#10;took his eyes from her for even a moment. The clock struck twelve,&#10;and, with a bounce, up sprang the lid of the snuff-box; but,&#10;instead of snuff, there jumped up a little black goblin; for the&#10;snuff-box was a toy puzzle.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Tin soldier,&#34; said the goblin, &#34;don&#39;t wish for what does&#10;not belong to you.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But the tin soldier pretended not to hear.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Very well; wait till to-morrow, then,&#34; said the&#10;goblin.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;When the children came in the next morning, they placed&#10;the tin soldier in the window. Now, whether it was the goblin who&#10;did it, or the draught, is not known, but the window flew open, and&#10;out fell the tin soldier, heels over head, from the third story,&#10;into the street beneath. It was a terrible fall; for he came head&#10;downwards, his helmet and his bayonet stuck in between the&#10;flagstones, and his one leg up in the air. The servant maid and the&#10;little boy went down stairs directly to look for him; but he was&#10;nowhere to be seen, although once they nearly trod upon him. If he&#10;had called out, &#34;Here I am,&#34; it would have been all right, but he&#10;was too proud to cry out for help while he wore a&#10;uniform.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Presently it began to rain, and the drops fell faster and&#10;faster, till there was a heavy shower. When it was over, two boys&#10;happened to pass by, and one of them said, &#34;Look, there is a tin&#10;soldier. He ought to have a boat to sail in.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;So they made a boat out of a newspaper, and placed the tin&#10;soldier in it, and sent him sailing down the gutter, while the two&#10;boys ran by the side of it, and clapped their hands. Good gracious,&#10;what large waves arose in that gutter! and how fast the stream&#10;rolled on! for the rain had been very heavy. The paper boat rocked&#10;up and down, and turned itself round sometimes so quickly that the&#10;tin soldier trembled; yet he remained firm; his countenance did not&#10;change; he looked straight before him, and shouldered his musket.&#10;Suddenly the boat shot under a bridge which formed a part of a&#10;drain, and then it was as dark as the tin soldier&#39;s box.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Where am I going now?&#34; thought he. &#34;This is the black&#10;goblin&#39;s fault, I am sure. Ah, well, if the little lady were only&#10;here with me in the boat, I should not care for any&#10;darkness.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Suddenly there appeared a great water-rat, who lived in&#10;the drain.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Have you a passport?&#34; asked the rat, &#34;give it to me at&#10;once.&#34; But the tin soldier remained silent and held his musket&#10;tighter than ever. The boat sailed on and the rat followed it. How&#10;he did gnash his teeth and cry out to the bits of wood and straw,&#10;&#34;Stop him, stop him; he has not paid toll, and has not shown his&#10;pass.&#34; But the stream rushed on stronger and stronger. The tin&#10;soldier could already see daylight shining where the arch ended.&#10;Then he heard a roaring sound quite terrible enough to frighten the&#10;bravest man. At the end of the tunnel the drain fell into a large&#10;canal over a steep place, which made it as dangerous for him as a&#10;waterfall would be to us. He was too close to it to stop, so the&#10;boat rushed on, and the poor tin soldier could only hold himself as&#10;stiffly as possible, without moving an eyelid, to show that he was&#10;not afraid. The boat whirled round three or four times, and then&#10;filled with water to the very edge; nothing could save it from&#10;sinking. He now stood up to his neck in water, while deeper and&#10;deeper sank the boat, and the paper became soft and loose with the&#10;wet, till at last the water closed over the soldier&#39;s head. He&#10;thought of the elegant little dancer whom he should never see&#10;again, and the words of the song sounded in his ears&#8212;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Farewell, warrior! ever brave,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Drifting onward to thy grave.&#34;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the paper boat fell to pieces, and the soldier sank&#10;into the water and immediately afterwards was swallowed up by a&#10;great fish. Oh how dark it was inside the fish! A great deal darker&#10;than in the tunnel, and narrower too, but the tin soldier continued&#10;firm, and lay at full length shouldering his musket. The fish swam&#10;to and fro, making the most wonderful movements, but at last he&#10;became quite still. After a while, a flash of lightning seemed to&#10;pass through him, and then the daylight approached, and a voice&#10;cried out, &#34;I declare here is the tin soldier.&#34; The fish had been&#10;caught, taken to the market and sold to the cook, who took him into&#10;the kitchen and cut him open with a large knife. She picked up the&#10;soldier and held him by the waist between her finger and thumb, and&#10;carried him into the room. They were all anxious to see this&#10;wonderful soldier who had travelled about inside a fish; but he was&#10;not at all proud. They placed him on the table, and&#8212;how many&#10;curious things do happen in the world!&#8212;there he was in the very&#10;same room from the window of which he had fallen, there were the&#10;same children, the same playthings, standing on the table, and the&#10;pretty castle with the elegant little dancer at the door; she still&#10;balanced herself on one leg, and held up the other, so she was as&#10;firm as himself. It touched the tin soldier so much to see her that&#10;he almost wept tin tears, but he kept them back. He only looked at&#10;her and they both remained silent. Presently one of the little boys&#10;took up the tin soldier, and threw him into the stove. He had no&#10;reason for doing so, therefore it must have been the fault of the&#10;black goblin who lived in the snuff-box. The flames lighted up the&#10;tin soldier, as he stood, the heat was very terrible, but whether&#10;it proceeded from the real fire or from the fire of love he could&#10;not tell. Then he could see that the bright colors were faded from&#10;his uniform, but whether they had been washed off during his&#10;journey or from the effects of his sorrow, no one could say. He&#10;looked at the little lady, and she looked at him. He felt himself&#10;melting away, but he still remained firm with his gun on his&#10;shoulder. Suddenly the door of the room flew open and the draught&#10;of air caught up the little dancer, she fluttered like a sylph&#10;right into the stove by the side of the tin soldier, and was&#10;instantly in flames and was gone. The tin soldier melted down into&#10;a lump, and the next morning, when the maid servant took the ashes&#10;out of the stove, she found him in the shape of a little tin heart.&#10;But of the little dancer nothing remained but the tinsel rose,&#10;which was burnt black as a cinder.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)

Her under-lip hung quite down on her breast, and she&#10;stopped and said, &#34;Good evening, soldier; you have a very fine&#10;sword, and a large knapsack, and you are a real soldier; so you&#10;shall have as much money as ever you like.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Thank you, old witch,&#34; said the soldier.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Do you see that large tree,&#34; said the witch, pointing to&#10;a tree which stood beside them. &#34;Well, it is quite hollow inside,&#10;and you must climb to the top, when you will see a hole, through&#10;which you can let yourself down into the tree to a great depth. I&#10;will tie a rope round your body, so that I can pull you up again&#10;when you call out to me.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But what am I to do, down there in the tree?&#34; asked the&#10;soldier.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Get money,&#34; she replied; &#34;for you must know that when you&#10;reach the ground under the tree, you will find yourself in a large&#10;hall, lighted up by three hundred lamps; you will then see three&#10;doors, which can be easily opened, for the keys are in all the&#10;locks. On entering the first of the chambers, to which these doors&#10;lead, you will see a large chest, standing in the middle of the&#10;floor, and upon it a dog seated, with a pair of eyes as large as&#10;teacups. But you need not be at all afraid of him; I will give you&#10;my blue checked apron, which you must spread upon the floor, and&#10;then boldly seize hold of the dog, and place him upon it. You can&#10;then open the chest, and take from it as many pence as you please,&#10;they are only copper pence; but if you would rather have silver&#10;money, you must go into the second chamber. Here you will find&#10;another dog, with eyes as big as mill-wheels; but do not let that&#10;trouble you. Place him upon my apron, and then take what money you&#10;please. If, however, you like gold best, enter the third chamber,&#10;where there is another chest full of it. The dog who sits on this&#10;chest is very dreadful; his eyes are as big as a tower, but do not&#10;mind him. If he also is placed upon my apron, he cannot hurt you,&#10;and you may take from the chest what gold you will.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;This is not a bad story,&#34; said the soldier; &#34;but what am&#10;I to give you, you old witch? for, of course, you do not mean to&#10;tell me all this for nothing.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No,&#34; said the witch; &#34;but I do not ask for a single&#10;penny. Only promise to bring me an old tinder-box, which my&#10;grandmother left behind the last time she went down&#10;there.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Very well; I promise. Now tie the rope round my&#10;body.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Here it is,&#34; replied the witch; &#34;and here is my blue&#10;checked apron.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;As soon as the rope was tied, the soldier climbed up the&#10;tree, and let himself down through the hollow to the ground&#10;beneath; and here he found, as the witch had told him, a large&#10;hall, in which many hundred lamps were all burning. Then he opened&#10;the first door. &#34;Ah!&#34; there sat the dog, with the eyes as large as&#10;teacups, staring at him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You&#39;re a pretty fellow,&#34; said the soldier, seizing him,&#10;and placing him on the witch&#39;s apron, while he filled his pockets&#10;from the chest with as many pieces as they would hold. Then he&#10;closed the lid, seated the dog upon it again, and walked into&#10;another chamber, And, sure enough, there sat the dog with eyes as&#10;big as mill-wheels.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You had better not look at me in that way,&#34; said the&#10;soldier; &#34;you will make your eyes water;&#34; and then he seated him&#10;also upon the apron, and opened the chest. But when he saw what a&#10;quantity of silver money it contained, he very quickly threw away&#10;all the coppers he had taken, and filled his pockets and his&#10;knapsack with nothing but silver.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then he went into the third room, and there the dog was&#10;really hideous; his eyes were, truly, as big as towers, and they&#10;turned round and round in his head like wheels.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Good morning,&#34; said the soldier, touching his cap, for he&#10;had never seen such a dog in his life. But after looking at him&#10;more closely, he thought he had been civil enough, so he placed him&#10;on the floor, and opened the chest. Good gracious, what a quantity&#10;of gold there was! enough to buy all the sugar-sticks of the&#10;sweet-stuff women; all the tin soldiers, whips, and rocking-horses&#10;in the world, or even the whole town itself There was, indeed, an&#10;immense quantity. So the soldier now threw away all the silver&#10;money he had taken, and filled his pockets and his knapsack with&#10;gold instead; and not only his pockets and his knapsack, but even&#10;his cap and boots, so that he could scarcely walk.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;He was really rich now; so he replaced the dog on the&#10;chest, closed the door, and called up through the tree, &#34;Now pull&#10;me out, you old witch.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Have you got the tinder-box?&#34; asked the witch.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No; I declare I quite forgot it.&#34; So he went back and&#10;fetched the tinderbox, and then the witch drew him up out of the&#10;tree, and he stood again in the high road, with his pockets, his&#10;knapsack, his cap, and his boots full of gold.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What are you going to do with the tinder-box?&#34; asked the&#10;soldier.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That is nothing to you,&#34; replied the witch; &#34;you have the&#10;money, now give me the tinder-box.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I tell you what,&#34; said the soldier, &#34;if you don&#39;t tell me&#10;what you are going to do with it, I will draw my sword and cut off&#10;your head.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No,&#34; said the witch.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The soldier immediately cut off her head, and there she&#10;lay on the ground. Then he tied up all his money in her apron. and&#10;slung it on his back like a bundle, put the tinderbox in his&#10;pocket, and walked off to the nearest town. It was a very nice&#10;town, and he put up at the best inn, and ordered a dinner of all&#10;his favorite dishes, for now he was rich and had plenty of&#10;money.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The servant, who cleaned his boots, thought they certainly&#10;were a shabby pair to be worn by such a rich gentleman, for he had&#10;not yet bought any new ones. The next day, however, he procured&#10;some good clothes and proper boots, so that our soldier soon became&#10;known as a fine gentleman, and the people visited him, and told him&#10;all the wonders that were to be seen in the town, and of the king&#39;s&#10;beautiful daughter, the princess.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Where can I see her?&#34; asked the soldier.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;She is not to be seen at all,&#34; they said; &#34;she lives in a&#10;large copper castle, surrounded by walls and towers. No one but the&#10;king himself can pass in or out, for there has been a prophecy that&#10;she will marry a common soldier, and the king cannot bear to think&#10;of such a marriage.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I should like very much to see her,&#34; thought the soldier;&#10;but he could not obtain permission to do so. However, he passed a&#10;very pleasant time; went to the theatre, drove in the king&#39;s&#10;garden, and gave a great deal of money to the poor, which was very&#10;good of him; he remembered what it had been in olden times to be&#10;without a shilling. Now he was rich, had fine clothes, and many&#10;friends, who all declared he was a fine fellow and a real&#10;gentleman, and all this gratified him exceedingly. But his money&#10;would not last forever; and as he spent and gave away a great deal&#10;daily, and received none, he found himself at last with only two&#10;shillings left. So he was obliged to leave his elegant rooms, and&#10;live in a little garret under the roof, where he had to clean his&#10;own boots, and even mend them with a large needle. None of his&#10;friends came to see him, there were too many stairs to mount up.&#10;One dark evening, he had not even a penny to buy a candle; then all&#10;at once he remembered that there was a piece of candle stuck in the&#10;tinder-box, which he had brought from the old tree, into which the&#10;witch had helped him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;He found the tinder-box, but no sooner had he struck a few&#10;sparks from the flint and steel, than the door flew open and the&#10;dog with eyes as big as teacups, whom he had seen while down in the&#10;tree, stood before him, and said, &#34;What orders, master?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Hallo,&#34; said the soldier; &#34;well this is a pleasant&#10;tinderbox, if it brings me all I wish for.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Bring me some money,&#34; said he to the dog.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;He was gone in a moment, and presently returned, carrying&#10;a large bag of coppers in his month. The soldier very soon&#10;discovered after this the value of the tinder-box. If he struck the&#10;flint once, the dog who sat on the chest of copper money made his&#10;appearance; if twice, the dog came from the chest of silver; and if&#10;three times, the dog with eyes like towers, who watched over the&#10;gold. The soldier had now plenty of money; he returned to his&#10;elegant rooms, and reappeared in his fine clothes, so that his&#10;friends knew him again directly, and made as much of him as&#10;before.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;After a while he began to think it was very strange that&#10;no one could get a look at the princess. &#34;Every one says she is&#10;very beautiful,&#34; thought he to himself; &#34;but what is the use of&#10;that if she is to be shut up in a copper castle surrounded by so&#10;many towers. Can I by any means get to see her. Stop! where is my&#10;tinder-box?&#34; Then he struck a light, and in a moment the dog, with&#10;eyes as big as teacups, stood before him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It is midnight,&#34; said the soldier, &#34;yet I should very&#10;much like to see the princess, if only for a moment.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The dog disappeared instantly, and before the soldier&#10;could even look round, he returned with the princess. She was lying&#10;on the dog&#39;s back asleep, and looked so lovely, that every one who&#10;saw her would know she was a real princess. The soldier could not&#10;help kissing her, true soldier as he was. Then the dog ran back&#10;with the princess; but in the morning, while at breakfast with the&#10;king and queen, she told them what a singular dream she had had&#10;during the night, of a dog and a soldier, that she had ridden on&#10;the dog&#39;s back, and been kissed by the soldier.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That is a very pretty story, indeed,&#34; said the queen. So&#10;the next night one of the old ladies of the court was set to watch&#10;by the princess&#39;s bed, to discover whether it really was a dream,&#10;or what else it might be.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The soldier longed very much to see the princess once&#10;more, so he sent for the dog again in the night to fetch her, and&#10;to run with her as fast as ever he could. But the old lady put on&#10;water boots, and ran after him as quickly as he did, and found that&#10;he carried the princess into a large house. She thought it would&#10;help her to remember the place if she made a large cross on the&#10;door with a piece of chalk. Then she went home to bed, and the dog&#10;presently returned with the princess. But when he saw that a cross&#10;had been made on the door of the house, where the soldier lived, he&#10;took another piece of chalk and made crosses on all the doors in&#10;the town, so that the lady-in-waiting might not be able to find out&#10;the right door.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Early the next morning the king and queen accompanied the&#10;lady and all the officers of the household, to see where the&#10;princess had been.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Here it is,&#34; said the king, when they came to the first&#10;door with a cross on it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;No, my dear husband, it must be that one,&#34; said the queen,&#10;pointing to a second door having a cross also.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And here is one, and there is another!&#34; they all&#10;exclaimed; for there were crosses on all the doors in every&#10;direction.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;So they felt it would be useless to search any farther.&#10;But the queen was a very clever woman; she could do a great deal&#10;more than merely ride in a carriage. She took her large gold&#10;scissors, cut a piece of silk into squares, and made a neat little&#10;bag. This bag she filled with buckwheat flour, and tied it round&#10;the princess&#39;s neck; and then she cut a small hole in the bag, so&#10;that the flour might be scattered on the ground as the princess&#10;went along. During the night, the dog came again and carried the&#10;princess on his back, and ran with her to the soldier, who loved&#10;her very much, and wished that he had been a prince, so that he&#10;might have her for a wife. The dog did not observe how the flour&#10;ran out of the bag all the way from the castle wall to the&#10;soldier&#39;s house, and even up to the window, where he had climbed&#10;with the princess. Therefore in the morning the king and queen&#10;found out where their daughter had been, and the soldier was taken&#10;up and put in prison. Oh, how dark and disagreeable it was as he&#10;sat there, and the people said to him, &#34;To-morrow you will be&#10;hanged.&#34; It was not very pleasant news, and besides, he had left&#10;the tinder-box at the inn. In the morning he could see through the&#10;iron grating of the little window how the people were hastening out&#10;of the town to see him hanged; he heard the drums beating, and saw&#10;the soldiers marching. Every one ran out to look at them. and a&#10;shoemaker&#39;s boy, with a leather apron and slippers on, galloped by&#10;so fast, that one of his slippers flew off and struck against the&#10;wall where the soldier sat looking through the iron grating.&#10;&#34;Hallo, you shoemaker&#39;s boy, you need not be in such a hurry,&#34;&#10;cried the soldier to him. &#34;There will be nothing to see till I&#10;come; but if you will run to the house where I have been living,&#10;and bring me my tinder-box, you shall have four shillings, but you&#10;must put your best foot foremost.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The shoemaker&#39;s boy liked the idea of getting the four&#10;shillings, so he ran very fast and fetched the tinder-box, and gave&#10;it to the soldier. And now we shall see what happened. Outside the&#10;town a large gibbet had been erected, round which stood the&#10;soldiers and several thousands of people. The king and the queen&#10;sat on splendid thrones opposite to the judges and the whole&#10;council. The soldier already stood on the ladder; but as they were&#10;about to place the rope around his neck, he said that an innocent&#10;request was often granted to a poor criminal before he suffered&#10;death. He wished very much to smoke a pipe, as it would be the last&#10;pipe he should ever smoke in the world. The king could not refuse&#10;this request, so the soldier took his tinder-box, and struck fire,&#10;once, twice, thrice,&#8212;and there in a moment stood all the dogs;&#8212;the&#10;one with eyes as big as teacups, the one with eyes as large as&#10;mill-wheels, and the third, whose eyes were like towers. &#34;Help me&#10;now, that I may not be hanged,&#34; cried the soldier.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the dogs fell upon the judges and all the councillors;&#10;seized one by the legs, and another by the nose, and tossed them&#10;many feet high in the air, so that they fell down and were dashed&#10;to pieces.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I will not be touched,&#34; said the king. But the largest&#10;dog seized him, as well as the queen, and threw them after the&#10;others. Then the soldiers and all the people were afraid, and&#10;cried, &#34;Good soldier, you shall be our king, and you shall marry&#10;the beautiful princess.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;So they placed the soldier in the king&#39;s carriage, and the&#10;three dogs ran on in front and cried &#34;Hurrah!&#34; and the little boys&#10;whistled through their fingers, and the soldiers presented arms.&#10;The princess came out of the copper castle, and became queen, which&#10;was very pleasing to her. The wedding festivities lasted a whole&#10;week, and the dogs sat at the table, and stared with all their&#10;eyes.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Top and Ball'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A WHIPPING TOP and a little ball lay together in a box,&#10;among other toys, and the top said to the ball, &#34;Shall we be&#10;married, as we live in the same box?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But the ball, which wore a dress of morocco leather, and&#10;thought as much of herself as any other young lady, would not even&#10;condescend to reply.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The next day came the little boy to whom the playthings&#10;belonged, and he painted the top red and yellow, and drove a&#10;brass-headed nail into the middle, so that while the top was&#10;spinning round it looked splendid.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Look at me,&#34; said the top to the ball. &#34;What do you say&#10;now? Shall we be engaged to each other? We should suit so well; you&#10;spring, and I dance. No one could be happier than we should&#10;be.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Indeed! do you think so? Perhaps you do not know that my&#10;father and mother were morocco slippers, and that I have a Spanish&#10;cork in my body.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes; but I am made of mahogany,&#34; said the top. &#34;The major&#10;himself turned me. He has a turning lathe of his own, and it is a&#10;great amusement to him.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Can I believe it?&#34; asked the ball.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;May I never be whipped again,&#34; said the top, &#34;if I am not&#10;telling you the truth.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You certainly know how to speak for yourself very well,&#34;&#10;said the ball; &#34;but I cannot accept your proposal. I am almost&#10;engaged to a swallow. Every time I fly up in the air, he puts his&#10;head out of the nest, and says, &#39;Will you?&#39; and I have said, &#39;Yes,&#39;&#10;to myself silently, and that is as good as being half engaged; but&#10;I will promise never to forget you.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Much good that will be to me,&#34; said the top; and they&#10;spoke to each other no more.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Next day the ball was taken out by the boy. The top saw it&#10;flying high in the air, like a bird, till it would go quite out of&#10;sight. Each time it came back, as it touched the earth, it gave a&#10;higher leap than before, either because it longed to fly upwards,&#10;or from having a Spanish cork in its body. But the ninth time it&#10;rose in the air, it remained away, and did not return. The boy&#10;searched everywhere for it, but he searched in vain, for it could&#10;not be found; it was gone.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I know very well where she is,&#34; sighed the top; &#34;she is&#10;in the swallow&#39;s nest, and has married the swallow.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The more the top thought of this, the more he longed for&#10;the ball. His love increased the more, just because he could not&#10;get her; and that she should have been won by another, was the&#10;worst of all. The top still twirled about and hummed, but he&#10;continued to think of the ball; and the more he thought of her, the&#10;more beautiful she seemed to his fancy.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Thus several years passed by, and his love became quite&#10;old. The top, also, was no longer young; but there came a day when&#10;he looked handsomer than ever; for he was gilded all over. He was&#10;now a golden top, and whirled and danced about till he hummed quite&#10;loud, and was something worth looking at; but one day he leaped too&#10;high, and then he, also, was gone. They searched everywhere, even&#10;in the cellar, but he was nowhere to be found. Where could he be?&#10;He had jumped into the dust-bin, where all sorts of rubbish were&#10;lying: cabbage-stalks, dust, and rain-droppings that had fallen&#10;down from the gutter under the roof.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Now I am in a nice place,&#34; said he; &#34;my gilding will soon&#10;be washed off here. Oh dear, what a set of rabble I have got&#10;amongst!&#34; And then he glanced at a curious round thing like an old&#10;apple, which lay near a long, leafless cabbage-stalk. It was,&#10;however, not an apple, but an old ball, which had lain for years in&#10;the gutter, and was soaked through with water.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Thank goodness, here comes one of my own class, with whom&#10;I can talk,&#34; said the ball, examining the gilded top. &#34;I am made of&#10;morocco,&#34; she said. &#34;I was sewn together by a young lady, and I&#10;have a Spanish cork in my body; but no one would think it, to look&#10;at me now. I was once engaged to a swallow; but I fell in here from&#10;the gutter under the roof, and I have lain here more than five&#10;years, and have been thoroughly drenched. Believe me, it is a long&#10;time for a young maiden.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The top said nothing, but he thought of his old love; and&#10;the more she said, the more clear it became to him that this was&#10;the same ball.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The servant then came to clean out the&#10;dust-bin.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Ah,&#34; she exclaimed, &#34;here is a gilt top.&#34; So the top was&#10;brought again to notice and honor, but nothing more was heard of&#10;the little ball. He spoke not a word about his old love; for that&#10;soon died away. When the beloved object has lain for five years in&#10;a gutter, and has been drenched through, no one cares to know her&#10;again on meeting her in a dust-bin.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)

Yes, he was the child of&#10;respectable people, and there were even some who said that he was&#10;the son of a privy councillor, or that he might have been. He had&#10;studied, too, and had been assistant teacher and deputy clerk; but&#10;of what service was all that to him? In those days he lived in the&#10;clerk&#39;s house, and was to have everything in the house&#8212;to be at&#10;free quarters, as the saying is; but he was still, so to speak, a&#10;fine young gentleman. He wanted to have his boots cleaned with&#10;patent blacking, and the clerk could only afford ordinary grease;&#10;and upon that point they split. One spoke of stinginess, the other&#10;of vanity, and the blacking became the black cause of enmity&#10;between them, and at last they parted.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;This is what he demanded of the world in general, namely,&#10;patent blacking, and he got nothing but grease. Accordingly, he at&#10;last drew back from all men, and became a hermit; but the church&#10;tower is the only place in a great city where hermitage, office and&#10;bread can be found together. So he betook himself up thither, and&#10;smoked his pipe as he made his solitary rounds. He looked upward&#10;and downward, and had his own thoughts, and told in his own way of&#10;what he read in books and in himself. I often lent him books&#8212;good&#10;books; and you may know by the company he keeps. He loved neither&#10;the English governess novels nor the French ones, which he called a&#10;mixture of empty wind and raisin-stalks: he wanted biographies, and&#10;descriptions of the wonders of, the world. I visited him at least&#10;once a year, generally directly after New Year&#39;s day, and then he&#10;always spoke of this and that which the change of the year had put&#10;into his head.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;I will tell the story of three of these visits, and will&#10;reproduce his own words whenever I can remember them.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)

Then he dreamed a&#10;strange dream; he thought he saw the sun shining upon him, and his&#10;father alive and well, and even heard him laughing as he used to do&#10;when he was very happy. A beautiful girl, with a golden crown on&#10;her head, and long, shining hair, gave him her hand; and his father&#10;said, &#34;See what a bride you have won. She is the loveliest maiden&#10;on the whole earth.&#34; Then he awoke, and all the beautiful things&#10;vanished before his eyes, his father lay dead on the bed, and he&#10;was all alone. Poor John!&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;During the following week the dead man was buried. The son&#10;walked behind the coffin which contained his father, whom he so&#10;dearly loved, and would never again behold. He heard the earth fall&#10;on the coffin-lid, and watched it till only a corner remained in&#10;sight, and at last that also disappeared. He felt as if his heart&#10;would break with its weight of sorrow, till those who stood round&#10;the grave sang a psalm, and the sweet, holy tones brought tears&#10;into his eyes, which relieved him. The sun shone brightly down on&#10;the green trees, as if it would say, &#34;You must not be so sorrowful,&#10;John. Do you see the beautiful blue sky above you? Your father is&#10;up there, and he prays to the loving Father of all, that you may do&#10;well in the future.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I will always be good,&#34; said John, &#34;and then I shall go&#10;to be with my father in heaven. What joy it will be when we see&#10;each other again! How much I shall have to relate to him, and how&#10;many things he will be able to explain to me of the delights of&#10;heaven, and teach me as he once did on earth. Oh, what joy it will&#10;be!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;He pictured it all so plainly to himself, that he smiled&#10;even while the tears ran down his cheeks.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The little birds in the chestnut-trees twittered, &#34;Tweet,&#10;tweet;&#34; they were so happy, although they had seen the funeral; but&#10;they seemed as if they knew that the dead man was now in heaven,&#10;and that he had wings much larger and more beautiful than their&#10;own; and he was happy now, because he had been good here on earth,&#10;and they were glad of it. John saw them fly away out of the green&#10;trees into the wide world, and he longed to fly with them; but&#10;first he cut out a large wooden cross, to place on his father&#39;s&#10;grave; and when he brought it there in the evening, he found the&#10;grave decked out with gravel and flowers. Strangers had done this;&#10;they who had known the good old father who was now dead, and who&#10;had loved him very much.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Early the next morning, John packed up his little bundle&#10;of clothes, and placed all his money, which consisted of fifty&#10;dollars and a few shillings, in his girdle; with this he determined&#10;to try his fortune in the world. But first he went into the&#10;churchyard; and, by his father&#39;s grave, he offered up a prayer, and&#10;said, &#34;Farewell.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;As he passed through the fields, all the flowers looked&#10;fresh and beautiful in the warm sunshine, and nodded in the wind,&#10;as if they wished to say, &#34;Welcome to the green wood, where all is&#10;fresh and bright.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then John turned to have one more look at the old church,&#10;in which he had been christened in his infancy, and where his&#10;father had taken him every Sunday to hear the service and join in&#10;singing the psalms. As he looked at the old tower, he espied the&#10;ringer standing at one of the narrow openings, with his little&#10;pointed red cap on his head, and shading his eyes from the sun with&#10;his bent arm. John nodded farewell to him, and the little ringer&#10;waved his red cap, laid his hand on his heart, and kissed his hand&#10;to him a great many times, to show that he felt kindly towards him,&#10;and wished him a prosperous journey.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;John continued his journey, and thought of all the&#10;wonderful things he should see in the large, beautiful world, till&#10;he found himself farther away from home than ever he had been&#10;before. He did not even know the names of the places he passed&#10;through, and could scarcely understand the language of the people&#10;he met, for he was far away, in a strange land. The first night he&#10;slept on a haystack, out in the fields, for there was no other bed&#10;for him; but it seemed to him so nice and comfortable that even a&#10;king need not wish for a better. The field, the brook, the&#10;haystack, with the blue sky above, formed a beautiful&#10;sleeping-room. The green grass, with the little red and white&#10;flowers, was the carpet; the elder-bushes and the hedges of wild&#10;roses looked like garlands on the walls; and for a bath he could&#10;have the clear, fresh water of the brook; while the rushes bowed&#10;their heads to him, to wish him good morning and good evening. The&#10;moon, like a large lamp, hung high up in the blue ceiling, and he&#10;had no fear of its setting fire to his curtains. John slept here&#10;quite safely all night; and when he awoke, the sun was up, and all&#10;the little birds were singing round him, &#34;Good morning, good&#10;morning. Are you not up yet?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was Sunday, and the bells were ringing for church. As&#10;the people went in, John followed them; he heard God&#39;s word, joined&#10;in singing the psalms, and listened to the preacher. It seemed to&#10;him just as if he were in his own church, where he had been&#10;christened, and had sung the psalms with his father. Out in the&#10;churchyard were several graves, and on some of them the grass had&#10;grown very high. John thought of his father&#39;s grave, which he knew&#10;at last would look like these, as he was not there to weed and&#10;attend to it. Then he set to work, pulled up the high grass, raised&#10;the wooden crosses which had fallen down, and replaced the wreaths&#10;which had been blown away from their places by the wind, thinking&#10;all the time, &#34;Perhaps some one is doing the same for my father&#39;s&#10;grave, as I am not there to do it &#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Outside the church door stood an old beggar, leaning on&#10;his crutch. John gave him his silver shillings, and then he&#10;continued his journey, feeling lighter and happier than ever.&#10;Towards evening, the weather became very stormy, and he hastened on&#10;as quickly as he could, to get shelter; but it was quite dark by&#10;the time he reached a little lonely church which stood on a hill.&#10;&#34;I will go in here,&#34; he said, &#34;and sit down in a corner; for I am&#10;quite tired, and want rest.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;So he went in, and seated himself; then he folded his&#10;hands, and offered up his evening prayer, and was soon fast asleep&#10;and dreaming, while the thunder rolled and the lightning flashed&#10;without. When he awoke, it was still night; but the storm had&#10;ceased, and the moon shone in upon him through the windows. Then he&#10;saw an open coffin standing in the centre of the church, which&#10;contained a dead man, waiting for burial. John was not at all&#10;timid; he had a good conscience, and he knew also that the dead can&#10;never injure any one. It is living wicked men who do harm to&#10;others. Two such wicked persons stood now by the dead man, who had&#10;been brought to the church to be buried. Their evil intentions were&#10;to throw the poor dead body outside the church door, and not leave&#10;him to rest in his coffin.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Why do you do this?&#34; asked John, when he saw what they&#10;were going to do; &#34;it is very wicked. Leave him to rest in peace,&#10;in Christ&#39;s name.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Nonsense,&#34; replied the two dreadful men. &#34;He has cheated&#10;us; he owed us money which he could not pay, and now he is dead we&#10;shall not get a penny; so we mean to have our revenge, and let him&#10;lie like a dog outside the church door.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I have only fifty dollars,&#34; said John, &#34;it is all I&#10;possess in the world, but I will give it to you if you will promise&#10;me faithfully to leave the dead man in peace. I shall be able to&#10;get on without the money; I have strong and healthy limbs, and God&#10;will always help me.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Why, of course,&#34; said the horrid men, &#34;if you will pay&#10;his debt we will both promise not to touch him. You may depend upon&#10;that;&#34; and then they took the money he offered them, laughed at him&#10;for his good nature, and went their way.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then he laid the dead body back in the coffin, folded the&#10;hands, and took leave of it; and went away contentedly through the&#10;great forest. All around him he could see the prettiest little&#10;elves dancing in the moonlight, which shone through the trees. They&#10;were not disturbed by his appearance, for they knew he was good and&#10;harmless among men. They are wicked people only who can never&#10;obtain a glimpse of fairies. Some of them were not taller than the&#10;breadth of a finger, and they wore golden combs in their long,&#10;yellow hair. They were rocking themselves two together on the large&#10;dew-drops with which the leaves and the high grass were sprinkled.&#10;Sometimes the dew-drops would roll away, and then they fell down&#10;between the stems of the long grass, and caused a great deal of&#10;laughing and noise among the other little people. It was quite&#10;charming to watch them at play. Then they sang songs, and John&#10;remembered that he had learnt those pretty songs when he was a&#10;little boy. Large speckled spiders, with silver crowns on their&#10;heads, were employed to spin suspension bridges and palaces from&#10;one hedge to another, and when the tiny drops fell upon them, they&#10;glittered in the moonlight like shining glass. This continued till&#10;sunrise. Then the little elves crept into the flower-buds, and the&#10;wind seized the bridges and palaces, and fluttered them in the air&#10;like cobwebs.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;As John left the wood, a strong man&#39;s voice called after&#10;him, &#34;Hallo, comrade, where are you travelling?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Into the wide world,&#34; he replied; &#34;I am only a poor lad,&#10;I have neither father nor mother, but God will help me.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I am going into the wide world also,&#34; replied the&#10;stranger; &#34;shall we keep each other company?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;With all my heart,&#34; he said, and so they went on&#10;together. Soon they began to like each other very much, for they&#10;were both good; but John found out that the stranger was much more&#10;clever than himself. He had travelled all over the world, and could&#10;describe almost everything. The sun was high in the heavens when&#10;they seated themselves under a large tree to eat their breakfast,&#10;and at the same moment an old woman came towards them. She was very&#10;old and almost bent double. She leaned upon a stick and carried on&#10;her back a bundle of firewood, which she had collected in the&#10;forest; her apron was tied round it, and John saw three great stems&#10;of fern and some willow twigs peeping out. just as she came close&#10;up to them, her foot slipped and she fell to the ground screaming&#10;loudly; poor old woman, she had broken her leg! John proposed&#10;directly that they should carry the old woman home to her cottage;&#10;but the stranger opened his knapsack and took out a box, in which&#10;he said he had a salve that would quickly make her leg well and&#10;strong again, so that she would be able to walk home herself, as if&#10;her leg had never been broken. And all that he would ask in return&#10;was the three fern stems which she carried in her apron.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That is rather too high a price,&#34; said the old woman,&#10;nodding her head quite strangely. She did not seem at all inclined&#10;to part with the fern stems. However, it was not very agreeable to&#10;lie there with a broken leg, so she gave them to him; and such was&#10;the power of the ointment, that no sooner had he rubbed her leg&#10;with it than the old mother rose up and walked even better than she&#10;had done before. But then this wonderful ointment could not be&#10;bought at a chemist&#39;s.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What can you want with those three fern rods?&#34; asked John&#10;of his fellow-traveller.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh, they will make capital brooms,&#34; said he; &#34;and I like&#10;them because I have strange whims sometimes.&#34; Then they walked on&#10;together for a long distance.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;How dark the sky is becoming,&#34; said John; &#34;and look at&#10;those thick, heavy clouds.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Those are not clouds,&#34; replied his fellow-traveller;&#10;&#34;they are mountains&#8212;large lofty mountains&#8212;on the tops of which we&#10;should be above the clouds, in the pure, free air. Believe me, it&#10;is delightful to ascend so high, tomorrow we shall be there.&#34; But&#10;the mountains were not so near as they appeared; they had to travel&#10;a whole day before they reached them, and pass through black&#10;forests and piles of rock as large as a town. The journey had been&#10;so fatiguing that John and his fellow-traveller stopped to rest at&#10;a roadside inn, so that they might gain strength for their journey&#10;on the morrow. In the large public room of the inn a great many&#10;persons were assembled to see a comedy performed by dolls. The&#10;showman had just erected his little theatre, and the people were&#10;sitting round the room to witness the performance. Right in front,&#10;in the very best place, sat a stout butcher, with a great bull-dog&#10;by his side who seemed very much inclined to bite. He sat staring&#10;with all his eyes, and so indeed did every one else in the room.&#10;And then the play began. It was a pretty piece, with a king and a&#10;queen in it, who sat on a beautiful throne, and had gold crowns on&#10;their heads. The trains to their dresses were very long, according&#10;to the fashion; while the prettiest of wooden dolls, with glass&#10;eyes and large mustaches, stood at the doors, and opened and shut&#10;them, that the fresh air might come into the room. It was a very&#10;pleasant play, not at all mournful; but just as the queen stood up&#10;and walked across the stage, the great bull-dog, who should have&#10;been held back by his master, made a spring forward, and caught the&#10;queen in the teeth by the slender wrist, so that it snapped in two.&#10;This was a very dreadful disaster. The poor man, who was exhibiting&#10;the dolls, was much annoyed, and quite sad about his queen; she was&#10;the prettiest doll he had, and the bull-dog had broken her head and&#10;shoulders off. But after all the people were gone away, the&#10;stranger, who came with John, said that he could soon set her to&#10;rights. And then he brought out his box and rubbed the doll with&#10;some of the salve with which he had cured the old woman when she&#10;broke her leg. As soon as this was done the doll&#39;s back became&#10;quite right again; her head and shoulders were fixed on, and she&#10;could even move her limbs herself: there was now no occasion to&#10;pull the wires, for the doll acted just like a living creature,&#10;excepting that she could not speak. The man to whom the show&#10;belonged was quite delighted at having a doll who could dance of&#10;herself without being pulled by the wires; none of the other dolls&#10;could do this.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;During the night, when all the people at the inn were gone&#10;to bed, some one was heard to sigh so deeply and painfully, and the&#10;sighing continued for so long a time, that every one got up to see&#10;what could be the matter. The showman went at once to his little&#10;theatre and found that it proceeded from the dolls, who all lay on&#10;the floor sighing piteously, and staring with their glass eyes;&#10;they all wanted to be rubbed with the ointment, so that, like the&#10;queen, they might be able to move of themselves. The queen threw&#10;herself on her knees, took off her beautiful crown, and, holding it&#10;in her hand, cried, &#34;Take this from me, but do rub my husband and&#10;his courtiers.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The poor man who owned the theatre could scarcely refrain&#10;from weeping; he was so sorry that he could not help them. Then he&#10;immediately spoke to John&#39;s comrade, and promised him all the money&#10;he might receive at the next evening&#39;s performance, if he would&#10;only rub the ointment on four or five of his dolls. But the&#10;fellow-traveller said he did not require anything in return,&#10;excepting the sword which the showman wore by his side. As soon as&#10;he received the sword he anointed six of the dolls with the&#10;ointment, and they were able immediately to dance so gracefully&#10;that all the living girls in the room could not help joining in the&#10;dance. The coachman danced with the cook, and the waiters with the&#10;chambermaids, and all the strangers joined; even the tongs and the&#10;fire-shovel made an attempt, but they fell down after the first&#10;jump. So after all it was a very merry night. The next morning John&#10;and his companion left the inn to continue their journey through&#10;the great pine-forests and over the high mountains. They arrived at&#10;last at such a great height that towns and villages lay beneath&#10;them, and the church steeples looked like little specks between the&#10;green trees. They could see for miles round, far away to places&#10;they had never visited, and John saw more of the beautiful world&#10;than he had ever known before. The sun shone brightly in the blue&#10;firmament above, and through the clear mountain air came the sound&#10;of the huntsman&#39;s horn, and the soft, sweet notes brought tears&#10;into his eyes, and he could not help exclaiming, &#34;How good and&#10;loving God is to give us all this beauty and loveliness in the&#10;world to make us happy!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;His fellow-traveller stood by with folded hands, gazing on&#10;the dark wood and the towns bathed in the warm sunshine. At this&#10;moment there sounded over their heads sweet music. They looked up,&#10;and discovered a large white swan hovering in the air, and singing&#10;as never bird sang before. But the song soon became weaker and&#10;weaker, the bird&#39;s head drooped, and he sunk slowly down, and lay&#10;dead at their feet.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It is a beautiful bird,&#34; said the traveller, &#34;and these&#10;large white wings are worth a great deal of money. I will take them&#10;with me. You see now that a sword will be very useful.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;So he cut off the wings of the dead swan with one blow,&#10;and carried them away with him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;They now continued their journey over the mountains for&#10;many miles, till they at length reached a large city, containing&#10;hundreds of towers, that shone in the sunshine like silver. In the&#10;midst of the city stood a splendid marble palace, roofed with pure&#10;red gold, in which dwelt the king. John and his companion would not&#10;go into the town immediately; so they stopped at an inn outside the&#10;town, to change their clothes; for they wished to appear&#10;respectable as they walked through the streets. The landlord told&#10;them that the king was a very good man, who never injured any one:&#10;but as to his daughter, &#34;Heaven defend us!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;She was indeed a wicked princess. She possessed beauty&#10;enough&#8212;nobody could be more elegant or prettier than she was; but&#10;what of that? for she was a wicked witch; and in consequence of her&#10;conduct many noble young princes had lost their lives. Any one was&#10;at liberty to make her an offer; were he a prince or a beggar, it&#10;mattered not to her. She would ask him to guess three things which&#10;she had just thought of, and if he succeed, he was to marry her,&#10;and be king over all the land when her father died; but if he could&#10;not guess these three things, then she ordered him to be hanged or&#10;to have his head cut off. The old king, her father, was very much&#10;grieved at her conduct, but he could not prevent her from being so&#10;wicked, because he once said he would have nothing more to do with&#10;her lovers; she might do as she pleased. Each prince who came and&#10;tried the three guesses, so that he might marry the princess, had&#10;been unable to find them out, and had been hanged or beheaded. They&#10;had all been warned in time, and might have left her alone, if they&#10;would. The old king became at last so distressed at all these&#10;dreadful circumstances, that for a whole day every year he and his&#10;soldiers knelt and prayed that the princess might become good; but&#10;she continued as wicked as ever. The old women who drank brandy&#10;would color it quite black before they drank it, to show how they&#10;mourned; and what more could they do?&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What a horrible princess!&#34; said John; &#34;she ought to be&#10;well flogged. If I were the old king, I would have her punished in&#10;some way.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Just then they heard the people outside shouting,&#10;&#34;Hurrah!&#34; and, looking out, they saw the princess passing by; and&#10;she was really so beautiful that everybody forgot her wickedness,&#10;and shouted &#34;Hurrah!&#34; Twelve lovely maidens in white silk dresses,&#10;holding golden tulips in their hands, rode by her side on&#10;coal-black horses. The princess herself had a snow-white steed,&#10;decked with diamonds and rubies. Her dress was of cloth of gold,&#10;and the whip she held in her hand looked like a sunbeam. The golden&#10;crown on her head glittered like the stars of heaven, and her&#10;mantle was formed of thousands of butterflies&#39; wings sewn together.&#10;Yet she herself was more beautiful than all.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;When John saw her, his face became as red as a drop of&#10;blood, and he could scarcely utter a word. The princess looked&#10;exactly like the beautiful lady with the golden crown, of whom he&#10;had dreamed on the night his father died. She appeared to him so&#10;lovely that he could not help loving her.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It could not be true,&#34; he thought, &#34;that she was really a&#10;wicked witch, who ordered people to be hanged or beheaded, if they&#10;could not guess her thoughts. Every one has permission to go and&#10;ask her hand, even the poorest beggar. I shall pay a visit to the&#10;palace,&#34; he said; &#34;I must go, for I cannot help myself.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then they all advised him not to attempt it; for he would&#10;be sure to share the same fate as the rest. His fellow-traveller&#10;also tried to persuade him against it; but John seemed quite sure&#10;of success. He brushed his shoes and his coat, washed his face and&#10;his hands, combed his soft flaxen hair, and then went out alone&#10;into the town, and walked to the palace.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Come in,&#34; said the king, as John knocked at the door.&#10;John opened it, and the old king, in a dressing gown and&#10;embroidered slippers, came towards him. He had the crown on his&#10;head, carried his sceptre in one hand, and the orb in the other.&#10;&#34;Wait a bit,&#34; said he, and he placed the orb under his arm, so that&#10;he could offer the other hand to John; but when he found that John&#10;was another suitor, he began to weep so violently, that both the&#10;sceptre and the orb fell to the floor, and he was obliged to wipe&#10;his eyes with his dressing gown. Poor old king! &#34;Let her alone,&#34; he&#10;said; &#34;you will fare as badly as all the others. Come, I will show&#10;you.&#34; Then he led him out into the princess&#39;s pleasure gardens, and&#10;there he saw a frightful sight. On every tree hung three or four&#10;king&#39;s sons who had wooed the princess, but had not been able to&#10;guess the riddles she gave them. Their skeletons rattled in every&#10;breeze, so that the terrified birds never dared to venture into the&#10;garden. All the flowers were supported by human bones instead of&#10;sticks, and human skulls in the flower-pots grinned horribly. It&#10;was really a doleful garden for a princess. &#34;Do you see all this?&#34;&#10;said the old king; &#34;your fate will be the same as those who are&#10;here, therefore do not attempt it. You really make me very&#10;unhappy,&#8212;I take these things to heart so very much.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;John kissed the good old king&#39;s hand, and said he was sure&#10;it would be all right, for he was quite enchanted with the&#10;beautiful princess. Then the princess herself came riding into the&#10;palace yard with all her ladies, and he wished her &#34;Good morning.&#34;&#10;She looked wonderfully fair and lovely when she offered her hand to&#10;John, and he loved her more than ever. How could she be a wicked&#10;witch, as all the people asserted? He accompanied her into the&#10;hall, and the little pages offered them gingerbread nuts and&#10;sweetmeats, but the old king was so unhappy he could eat nothing,&#10;and besides, gingerbread nuts were too hard for him. It was decided&#10;that John should come to the palace the next day, when the judges&#10;and the whole of the counsellors would be present, to try if he&#10;could guess the first riddle. If he succeeded, he would have to&#10;come a second time; but if not, he would lose his life,&#8212;and no one&#10;had ever been able to guess even one. However, John was not at all&#10;anxious about the result of his trial; on the contrary, he was very&#10;merry. He thought only of the beautiful princess, and believed that&#10;in some way he should have help, but how he knew not, and did not&#10;like to think about it; so he danced along the high-road as he went&#10;back to the inn, where he had left his fellow-traveller waiting for&#10;him. John could not refrain from telling him how gracious the&#10;princess had been, and how beautiful she looked. He longed for the&#10;next day so much, that he might go to the palace and try his luck&#10;at guessing the riddles. But his comrade shook his head, and looked&#10;very mournful. &#34;I do so wish you to do well,&#34; said he; &#34;we might&#10;have continued together much longer, and now I am likely to lose&#10;you; you poor dear John! I could shed tears, but I will not make&#10;you unhappy on the last night we may be together. We will be merry,&#10;really merry this evening; to-morrow, after you are gone, shall be&#10;able to weep undisturbed.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was very quickly known among the inhabitants of the&#10;town that another suitor had arrived for the princess, and there&#10;was great sorrow in consequence. The theatre remained closed, the&#10;women who sold sweetmeats tied crape round the sugar-sticks, and&#10;the king and the priests were on their knees in the church. There&#10;was a great lamentation, for no one expected John to succeed better&#10;than those who had been suitors before.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the evening John&#39;s comrade prepared a large bowl of&#10;punch, and said, &#34;Now let us be merry, and drink to the health of&#10;the princess.&#34; But after drinking two glasses, John became so&#10;sleepy, that he could not keep his eyes open, and fell fast asleep.&#10;Then his fellow-traveller lifted him gently out of his chair, and&#10;laid him on the bed; and as soon as it was quite dark, he took the&#10;two large wings which he had cut from the dead swan, and tied them&#10;firmly to his own shoulders. Then he put into his pocket the&#10;largest of the three rods which he had obtained from the old woman&#10;who had fallen and broken her leg. After this he opened the window,&#10;and flew away over the town, straight towards the palace, and&#10;seated himself in a corner, under the window which looked into the&#10;bedroom of the princess.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The town was perfectly still when the clocks struck a&#10;quarter to twelve. Presently the window opened, and the princess,&#10;who had large black wings to her shoulders, and a long white&#10;mantle, flew away over the city towards a high mountain. The&#10;fellow-traveller, who had made himself invisible, so that she could&#10;not possibly see him, flew after her through the air, and whipped&#10;the princess with his rod, so that the blood came whenever he&#10;struck her. Ah, it was a strange flight through the air! The wind&#10;caught her mantle, so that it spread out on all sides, like the&#10;large sail of a ship, and the moon shone through it. &#34;How it hails,&#10;to be sure!&#34; said the princess, at each blow she received from the&#10;rod; and it served her right to be whipped.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;At last she reached the side of the mountain, and knocked.&#10;The mountain opened with a noise like the roll of thunder, and the&#10;princess went in. The traveller followed her; no one could see him,&#10;as he had made himself invisible. They went through a long, wide&#10;passage. A thousand gleaming spiders ran here and there on the&#10;walls, causing them to glitter as if they were illuminated with&#10;fire. They next entered a large hall built of silver and gold.&#10;Large red and blue flowers shone on the walls, looking like&#10;sunflowers in size, but no one could dare to pluck them, for the&#10;stems were hideous poisonous snakes, and the flowers were flames of&#10;fire, darting out of their jaws. Shining glow-worms covered the&#10;ceiling, and sky-blue bats flapped their transparent wings.&#10;Altogether the place had a frightful appearance. In the middle of&#10;the floor stood a throne supported by four skeleton horses, whose&#10;harness had been made by fiery-red spiders. The throne itself was&#10;made of milk-white glass, and the cushions were little black mice,&#10;each biting the other&#39;s tail. Over it hung a canopy of rose-colored&#10;spider&#39;s webs, spotted with the prettiest little green flies, which&#10;sparkled like precious stones. On the throne sat an old magician&#10;with a crown on his ugly head, and a sceptre in his hand. He kissed&#10;the princess on the forehead, seated her by his side on the&#10;splendid throne, and then the music commenced. Great black&#10;grasshoppers played the mouth organ, and the owl struck herself on&#10;the body instead of a drum. It was altogether a ridiculous concert.&#10;Little black goblins with false lights in their caps danced about&#10;the hall; but no one could see the traveller, and he had placed&#10;himself just behind the throne where he could see and hear&#10;everything. The courtiers who came in afterwards looked noble and&#10;grand; but any one with common sense could see what they really&#10;were, only broomsticks, with cabbages for heads. The magician had&#10;given them life, and dressed them in embroidered robes. It answered&#10;very well, as they were only wanted for show. After there had been&#10;a little dancing, the princess told the magician that she had a new&#10;suitor, and asked him what she could think of for the suitor to&#10;guess when he came to the castle the next morning.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Listen to what I say,&#34; said the magician, &#34;you must&#10;choose something very easy, he is less likely to guess it then.&#10;Think of one of your shoes, he will never imagine it is that. Then&#10;cut his head off; and mind you do not forget to bring his eyes with&#10;you to-morrow night, that I may eat them.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The princess curtsied low, and said she would not forget&#10;the eyes.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The magician then opened the mountain and she flew home&#10;again, but the traveller followed and flogged her so much with the&#10;rod, that she sighed quite deeply about the heavy hail-storm, and&#10;made as much haste as she could to get back to her bedroom through&#10;the window. The traveller then returned to the inn where John still&#10;slept, took off his wings and laid down on the bed, for he was very&#10;tired. Early in the morning John awoke, and when his&#10;fellow-traveller got up, he said that he had a very wonderful dream&#10;about the princess and her shoe, he therefore advised John to ask&#10;her if she had not thought of her shoe. Of course the traveller&#10;knew this from what the magician in the mountain had&#10;said.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I may as well say that as anything,&#34; said John. &#34;Perhaps&#10;your dream may come true; still I will say farewell, for if I guess&#10;wrong I shall never see you again.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then they embraced each other, and John went into the town&#10;and walked to the palace. The great hall was full of people, and&#10;the judges sat in arm-chairs, with eider-down cushions to rest&#10;their heads upon, because they had so much to think of. The old&#10;king stood near, wiping his eyes with his white&#10;pocket-handkerchief. When the princess entered, she looked even&#10;more beautiful than she had appeared the day before, and greeted&#10;every one present most gracefully; but to John she gave her hand,&#10;and said, &#34;Good morning to you.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Now came the time for John to guess what she was thinking&#10;of; and oh, how kindly she looked at him as she spoke. But when he&#10;uttered the single word shoe, she turned as pale as a ghost; all&#10;her wisdom could not help her, for he had guessed rightly. Oh, how&#10;pleased the old king was! It was quite amusing to see how he&#10;capered about. All the people clapped their hands, both on his&#10;account and John&#39;s, who had guessed rightly the first time. His&#10;fellow-traveller was glad also, when he heard how successful John&#10;had been. But John folded his hands, and thanked God, who, he felt&#10;quite sure, would help him again; and he knew he had to guess twice&#10;more. The evening passed pleasantly like the one preceding. While&#10;John slept, his companion flew behind the princess to the mountain,&#10;and flogged her even harder than before; this time he had taken two&#10;rods with him. No one saw him go in with her, and he heard all that&#10;was said. The princess this time was to think of a glove, and he&#10;told John as if he had again heard it in a dream. The next day,&#10;therefore, he was able to guess correctly the second time, and it&#10;caused great rejoicing at the palace. The whole court jumped about&#10;as they had seen the king do the day before, but the princess lay&#10;on the sofa, and would not say a single word. All now depended upon&#10;John. If he only guessed rightly the third time, he would marry the&#10;princess, and reign over the kingdom after the death of the old&#10;king: but if he failed, he would lose his life, and the magician&#10;would have his beautiful blue eyes. That evening John said his&#10;prayers and went to bed very early, and soon fell asleep calmly.&#10;But his companion tied on his wings to his shoulders, took three&#10;rods, and, with his sword at his side, flew to the palace. It was a&#10;very dark night, and so stormy that the tiles flew from the roofs&#10;of the houses, and the trees in the garden upon which the skeletons&#10;hung bent themselves like reeds before the wind. The lightning&#10;flashed, and the thunder rolled in one long-continued peal all&#10;night. The window of the castle opened, and the princess flew out.&#10;She was pale as death, but she laughed at the storm as if it were&#10;not bad enough. Her white mantle fluttered in the wind like a large&#10;sail, and the traveller flogged her with the three rods till the&#10;blood trickled down, and at last she could scarcely fly; she&#10;contrived, however, to reach the mountain. &#34;What a hail-storm!&#34; she&#10;said, as she entered; &#34;I have never been out in such weather as&#10;this.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, there may be too much of a good thing sometimes,&#34;&#10;said the magician.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the princess told him that John had guessed rightly&#10;the second time, and if he succeeded the next morning, he would&#10;win, and she could never come to the mountain again, or practice&#10;magic as she had done, and therefore she was quite unhappy. &#34;I will&#10;find out something for you to think of which he will never guess,&#10;unless he is a greater conjuror than myself. But now let us be&#10;merry.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then he took the princess by both hands, and they danced&#10;with all the little goblins and Jack-o&#39;-lanterns in the room. The&#10;red spiders sprang here and there on the walls quite as merrily,&#10;and the flowers of fire appeared as if they were throwing out&#10;sparks. The owl beat the drum, the crickets whistled and the&#10;grasshoppers played the mouth-organ. It was a very ridiculous ball.&#10;After they had danced enough, the princess was obliged to go home,&#10;for fear she should be missed at the palace. The magician offered&#10;to go with her, that they might be company to each other on the&#10;way. Then they flew away through the bad weather, and the traveller&#10;followed them, and broke his three rods across their shoulders. The&#10;magician had never been out in such a hail-storm as this. Just by&#10;the palace the magician stopped to wish the princess farewell, and&#10;to whisper in her ear, &#34;To-morrow think of my head.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But the traveller heard it, and just as the princess&#10;slipped through the window into her bedroom, and the magician&#10;turned round to fly back to the mountain, he seized him by the long&#10;black beard, and with his sabre cut off the wicked conjuror&#39;s head&#10;just behind the shoulders, so that he could not even see who it&#10;was. He threw the body into the sea to the fishes, and after&#10;dipping the head into the water, he tied it up in a silk&#10;handkerchief, took it with him to the inn, and then went to bed.&#10;The next morning he gave John the handkerchief, and told him not to&#10;untie it till the princess asked him what she was thinking of.&#10;There were so many people in the great hall of the palace that they&#10;stood as thick as radishes tied together in a bundle. The council&#10;sat in their arm-chairs with the white cushions. The old king wore&#10;new robes, and the golden crown and sceptre had been polished up so&#10;that he looked quite smart. But the princess was very pale, and&#10;wore a black dress as if she were going to a funeral.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What have I thought of?&#34; asked the princess, of John. He&#10;immediately untied the handkerchief, and was himself quite&#10;frightened when he saw the head of the ugly magician. Every one&#10;shuddered, for it was terrible to look at; but the princess sat&#10;like a statue, and could not utter a single word. At length she&#10;rose and gave John her hand, for he had guessed rightly.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;She looked at no one, but sighed deeply, and said, &#34;You&#10;are my master now; this evening our marriage must take&#10;place.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I am very pleased to hear it,&#34; said the old king. &#34;It is&#10;just what I wish.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then all the people shouted &#34;Hurrah.&#34; The band played&#10;music in the streets, the bells rang, and the cake-women took the&#10;black crape off the sugar-sticks. There was universal joy. Three&#10;oxen, stuffed with ducks and chickens, were roasted whole in the&#10;market-place, where every one might help himself to a slice. The&#10;fountains spouted forth the most delicious wine, and whoever bought&#10;a penny loaf at the baker&#39;s received six large buns, full of&#10;raisins, as a present. In the evening the whole town was&#10;illuminated. The soldiers fired off cannons, and the boys let off&#10;crackers. There was eating and drinking, dancing and jumping&#10;everywhere. In the palace, the high-born gentlemen and beautiful&#10;ladies danced with each other, and they could be heard at a great&#10;distance singing the following song:&#8212;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Here are maidens, young and fair,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Dancing in the summer air;&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Like two spinning-wheels at play,&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Pretty maidens dance away-&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Dance the spring and summer through&#60;br /&#62;&#10;Till the sole falls from your shoe.&#34;&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But the princess was still a witch, and she could not love&#10;John. His fellow-traveller had thought of that, so he gave John&#10;three feathers out of the swan&#39;s wings, and a little bottle with a&#10;few drops in it. He told him to place a large bath full of water by&#10;the princess&#39;s bed, and put the feathers and the drops into it.&#10;Then, at the moment she was about to get into bed, he must give her&#10;a little push, so that she might fall into the water, and then dip&#10;her three times. This would destroy the power of the magician, and&#10;she would love him very much. John did all that his companion told&#10;him to do. The princess shrieked aloud when he dipped her under the&#10;water the first time, and struggled under his hands in the form of&#10;a great black swan with fiery eyes. As she rose the second time&#10;from the water, the swan had become white, with a black ring round&#10;its neck. John allowed the water to close once more over the bird,&#10;and at the same time it changed into a most beautiful princess. She&#10;was more lovely even than before, and thanked him, while her eyes&#10;sparkled with tears, for having broken the spell of the magician.&#10;The next day, the king came with the whole court to offer their&#10;congratulations, and stayed till quite late. Last of all came the&#10;travelling companion; he had his staff in his hand and his knapsack&#10;on his back. John kissed him many times and told him he must not&#10;go, he must remain with him, for he was the cause of all his good&#10;fortune. But the traveller shook his head, and said gently and&#10;kindly, &#34;No: my time is up now; I have only paid my debt to you. Do&#10;you remember the dead man whom the bad people wished to throw out&#10;of his coffin? You gave all you possessed that he might rest in his&#10;grave; I am that man.&#34; As he said this, he vanished.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The wedding festivities lasted a whole month. John and his&#10;princess loved each other dearly, and the old king lived to see&#10;many a happy day, when he took their little children on his knees&#10;and let them play with his sceptre. And John became king over the&#10;whole country.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)

In one of these&#10;houses strange things were brewing over the glowing coals on the&#10;open hearth; there was a boiling going on in glasses, and a mixing&#10;and distilling, while herbs were being cut up and pounded in&#10;mortars. An elderly man looked after it all.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;One must only do the right thing,&#34; he said; &#34;yes, the&#10;right&#8212;the correct thing. One must find out the truth concerning&#10;every created particle, and keep to that.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the room with the good housewife sat her two sons; they&#10;were still small, but had great thoughts. Their mother, too, had&#10;always spoken to them of right and justice, and exhorted them to&#10;keep to the truth, which she said was the countenance of the Lord&#10;in this world.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The elder of the boys looked roguish and enterprising. He&#10;took a delight in reading of the forces of nature, of the sun and&#10;the moon; no fairy tale pleased him so much. Oh, how beautiful it&#10;must be, he thought, to go on voyages of discovery, or to find out&#10;how to imitate the wings of birds and then to be able to fly! Yes,&#10;to find that out was the right thing. Father was right, and mother&#10;was right&#8212;truth holds the world together.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The younger brother was quieter, and buried himself&#10;entirely in his books. When he read about Jacob dressing himself in&#10;sheep-skins to personify Esau, and so to usurp his brother&#39;s&#10;birthright, he would clench his little fist in anger against the&#10;deceiver; when he read of tyrants and of the injustice and&#10;wickedness of the world, tears would come into his eyes, and he was&#10;quite filled with the thought of the justice and truth which must&#10;and would triumph.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;One evening he was lying in bed, but the curtains were not&#10;yet drawn close, and the light streamed in upon him; he had taken&#10;his book into bed with him, for he wanted to finish reading the&#10;story of Solon. His thoughts lifted and carried him away a&#10;wonderful distance; it seemed to him as if the bed had become a&#10;ship flying along under full sail. Was he dreaming, or what was&#10;happening? It glided over the rolling waves and across the ocean of&#10;time, and to him came the voice of Solon; spoken in a strange&#10;tongue, yet intelligible to him, he heard the Danish motto: &#34;By law&#10;the land is ruled.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The genius of the human race stood in the humble room,&#10;bent down over the bed and imprinted a kiss on the boy&#39;s forehead:&#10;&#34;Be thou strong in fame and strong in the battle of life! With&#10;truth in thy heart fly toward the land of truth!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The elder brother was not yet in bed; he was standing at&#10;the window looking out at the mist which rose from the meadows.&#10;They were not elves dancing out there, as their old nurse had told&#10;him; he knew better&#8212;they were vapours which were warmer than the&#10;air, and that is why they rose. A shooting star lit up the sky, and&#10;the boy&#39;s thoughts passed in a second from the vapours of the earth&#10;up to the shining meteor. The stars gleamed in the heavens, and it&#10;seemed as if long golden threads hung down from them to the&#10;earth.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Fly with me,&#34; sang a voice, which the boy heard in his&#10;heart. And the mighty genius of mankind, swifter than a bird and&#10;than an arrow&#8212;swifter than anything of earthly origin&#8212;carried him&#10;out into space, where the heavenly bodies are bound together by the&#10;rays that pass from star to star. Our earth revolved in the thin&#10;air, and the cities upon it seemed to lie close to each other.&#10;Through the spheres echoed the words:&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What is near, what is far, when thou art lifted by the&#10;mighty genius of mind?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And again the boy stood by the window, gazing out, whilst&#10;his younger brother lay in bed. Their mother called them by their&#10;names: &#34;Anders Sandoe&#34; and &#34;Hans Christian.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Denmark and the whole world knows them&#8212;the two brothers&#10;Oersted.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)

I mean what our pavers call a&#10;maiden, a thing with which they ram down the paving-stones in the&#10;roads. A maiden of this kind is made altogether of wood, broad&#10;below, and girt round with iron rings. At the top she is narrow,&#10;and has a stick passed across through her waist, and this stick&#10;forms the arms of the maiden.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the shed stood two Maidens of this kind. They had their&#10;place among shovels, hand-carts, wheelbarrows, and measuring-tapes;&#10;and to all this company the news had come that the Maidens were no&#10;longer to be called &#34;maidens,&#34; but &#34;hand-rammers,&#34; which word was&#10;the newest and the only correct designation among the pavers for&#10;the thing we all know from the old times by the name of &#34;the&#10;maiden.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Now, there are among us human creatures certain&#10;individuals who are known as &#34;emancipated women,&#34; as, for instance,&#10;principals of institutions, dancers who stand professionally on one&#10;leg, milliners, and sick-nurses; and with this class of emancipated&#10;women the two Maidens in the shed associated themselves. They were&#10;&#34;maidens&#34; among the paver folk, and determined not to give up this&#10;honorable appellation, and let themselves be miscalled&#10;&#34;rammers.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Maiden is a human name, but hand-rammer is a thing, and&#10;we won&#39;t be called things&#8212;that&#39;s insulting us.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;My lover would be ready to give up his engagement,&#34; said&#10;the youngest, who was betrothed to a paver&#39;s hammer; and the hammer&#10;is the thing which drives great piles into the earth, like a&#10;machine, and therefore does on a large scale what ten maidens&#10;effect in a similar way. &#34;He wants to marry me as a maiden, but&#10;whether he would have me were I a hand-rammer is a question, so I&#10;won&#39;t have my name changed.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And I,&#34; said the elder one, &#34;would rather have both my&#10;arms broken off.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But the Wheelbarrow was of a different opinion; and the&#10;Wheelbarrow was looked upon as of some consequence, for he&#10;considered himself a quarter of a coach, because he went about upon&#10;one wheel.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I must submit to your notice,&#34; he said, &#34;that the name&#10;&#39;maiden&#39; is common enough, and not nearly so refined as&#10;&#39;hand-rammer,&#39; or &#39;stamper,&#39; which latter has also been proposed,&#10;and through which you would be introduced into the category of&#10;seals; and only think of the great stamp of state, which impresses&#10;the royal seal that gives effect to the laws! No, in your case I&#10;would surrender my maiden name.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No, certainly not!&#34; exclaimed the elder. &#34;I am too old&#10;for that.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I presume you have never heard of what is called&#10;&#39;European necessity?&#39;&#34; observed the honest Measuring Tape. &#34;One&#10;must be able to adapt one&#39;s self to time and circumstances, and if&#10;there is a law that the &#39;maiden&#39; is to be called &#39;hand-rammer,&#39;&#10;why, she must be called &#39;hand-rammer,&#39; and no pouting will avail,&#10;for everything has its measure.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No; if there must be a change,&#34; said the younger, &#34;I&#10;should prefer to be called &#39;Missy,&#39; for that reminds one a little&#10;of maidens.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But I would rather be chopped to chips,&#34; said the&#10;elder.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;At last they all went to work. The Maidens rode&#8212;that is,&#10;they were put in a wheelbarrow, and that was a distinction; but&#10;still they were called &#34;hand-rammers.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Mai-!&#34; they said, as they were bumped upon the pavement.&#10;&#34;Mai-!&#34; and they were very nearly pronouncing the whole word&#10;&#34;maiden;&#34; but they broke off short, and swallowed the last&#10;syllable; for after mature deliberation they considered it beneath&#10;their dignity to protest. But they always called each other&#10;&#34;maiden,&#34; and praised the good old days in which everything had&#10;been called by its right name, and those who were maidens were&#10;called maidens. And they remained as they were; for the hammer&#10;really broke off his engagement with the younger one, for nothing&#10;would suit him but he must have a maiden for his bride.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Ugly Duckling'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;IT was lovely summer weather in the country, and the&#10;golden corn, the green oats, and the haystacks piled up in the&#10;meadows looked beautiful. The stork walking about on his long red&#10;legs chattered in the Egyptian language, which he had learnt from&#10;his mother. The corn-fields and meadows were surrounded by large&#10;forests, in the midst of which were deep pools. It was, indeed,&#10;delightful to walk about in the country. In a sunny spot stood a&#10;pleasant old farm-house close by a deep river, and from the house&#10;down to the water side grew great burdock leaves, so high, that&#10;under the tallest of them a little child could stand upright. The&#10;spot was as wild as the centre of a thick wood. In this snug&#10;retreat sat a duck on her nest, watching for her young brood to&#10;hatch; she was beginning to get tired of her task, for the little&#10;ones were a long time coming out of their shells, and she seldom&#10;had any visitors. The other ducks liked much better to swim about&#10;in the river than to climb the slippery banks, and sit under a&#10;burdock leaf, to have a gossip with her. At length one shell&#10;cracked, and then another, and from each egg came a living creature&#10;that lifted its head and cried, &#34;Peep, peep.&#34; &#34;Quack, quack,&#34; said&#10;the mother, and then they all quacked as well as they could, and&#10;looked about them on every side at the large green leaves. Their&#10;mother allowed them to look as much as they liked, because green is&#10;good for the eyes. &#34;How large the world is,&#34; said the young ducks,&#10;when they found how much more room they now had than while they&#10;were inside the egg-shell. &#34;Do you imagine this is the whole&#10;world?&#34; asked the mother; &#34;Wait till you have seen the garden; it&#10;stretches far beyond that to the parson&#39;s field, but I have never&#10;ventured to such a distance. Are you all out?&#34; she continued,&#10;rising; &#34;No, I declare, the largest egg lies there still. I wonder&#10;how long this is to last, I am quite tired of it;&#34; and she seated&#10;herself again on the nest.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Well, how are you getting on?&#34; asked an old duck, who&#10;paid her a visit.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;One egg is not hatched yet,&#34; said the duck, &#34;it will not&#10;break. But just look at all the others, are they not the prettiest&#10;little ducklings you ever saw? They are the image of their father,&#10;who is so unkind, he never comes to see.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Let me see the egg that will not break,&#34; said the duck;&#10;&#34;I have no doubt it is a turkey&#39;s egg. I was persuaded to hatch&#10;some once, and after all my care and trouble with the young ones,&#10;they were afraid of the water. I quacked and clucked, but all to no&#10;purpose. I could not get them to venture in. Let me look at the&#10;egg. Yes, that is a turkey&#39;s egg; take my advice, leave it where it&#10;is and teach the other children to swim.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I think I will sit on it a little while longer,&#34; said the&#10;duck; &#34;as I have sat so long already, a few days will be&#10;nothing.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Please yourself,&#34; said the old duck, and she went&#10;away.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;At last the large egg broke, and a young one crept forth&#10;crying, &#34;Peep, peep.&#34; It was very large and ugly. The duck stared&#10;at it and exclaimed, &#34;It is very large and not at all like the&#10;others. I wonder if it really is a turkey. We shall soon find it&#10;out, however when we go to the water. It must go in, if I have to&#10;push it myself.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;On the next day the weather was delightful, and the sun&#10;shone brightly on the green burdock leaves, so the mother duck took&#10;her young brood down to the water, and jumped in with a splash.&#10;&#34;Quack, quack,&#34; cried she, and one after another the little&#10;ducklings jumped in. The water closed over their heads, but they&#10;came up again in an instant, and swam about quite prettily with&#10;their legs paddling under them as easily as possible, and the ugly&#10;duckling was also in the water swimming with them.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh,&#34; said the mother, &#34;that is not a turkey; how well he&#10;uses his legs, and how upright he holds himself! He is my own&#10;child, and he is not so very ugly after all if you look at him&#10;properly. Quack, quack! come with me now, I will take you into&#10;grand society, and introduce you to the farmyard, but you must keep&#10;close to me or you may be trodden upon; and, above all, beware of&#10;the cat.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;When they reached the farmyard, there was a great&#10;disturbance, two families were fighting for an eel&#39;s head, which,&#10;after all, was carried off by the cat. &#34;See, children, that is the&#10;way of the world,&#34; said the mother duck, whetting her beak, for she&#10;would have liked the eel&#39;s head herself. &#34;Come, now, use your legs,&#10;and let me see how well you can behave. You must bow your heads&#10;prettily to that old duck yonder; she is the highest born of them&#10;all, and has Spanish blood, therefore, she is well off. Don&#39;t you&#10;see she has a red flag tied to her leg, which is something very&#10;grand, and a great honor for a duck; it shows that every one is&#10;anxious not to lose her, as she can be recognized both by man and&#10;beast. Come, now, don&#39;t turn your toes, a well-bred duckling&#10;spreads his feet wide apart, just like his father and mother, in&#10;this way; now bend your neck, and say &#39;quack.&#39;&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The ducklings did as they were bid, but the other duck&#10;stared, and said, &#34;Look, here comes another brood, as if there were&#10;not enough of us already! and what a queer looking object one of&#10;them is; we don&#39;t want him here,&#34; and then one flew out and bit him&#10;in the neck.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Let him alone,&#34; said the mother; &#34;he is not doing any&#10;harm.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, but he is so big and ugly,&#34; said the spiteful duck&#10;&#34;and therefore he must be turned out.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The others are very pretty children,&#34; said the old duck,&#10;with the rag on her leg, &#34;all but that one; I wish his mother could&#10;improve him a little.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That is impossible, your grace,&#34; replied the mother; &#34;he&#10;is not pretty; but he has a very good disposition, and swims as&#10;well or even better than the others. I think he will grow up&#10;pretty, and perhaps be smaller; he has remained too long in the&#10;egg, and therefore his figure is not properly formed;&#34; and then she&#10;stroked his neck and smoothed the feathers, saying, &#34;It is a drake,&#10;and therefore not of so much consequence. I think he will grow up&#10;strong, and able to take care of himself.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The other ducklings are graceful enough,&#34; said the old&#10;duck. &#34;Now make yourself at home, and if you can find an eel&#39;s&#10;head, you can bring it to me.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And so they made themselves comfortable; but the poor&#10;duckling, who had crept out of his shell last of all, and looked so&#10;ugly, was bitten and pushed and made fun of, not only by the ducks,&#10;but by all the poultry. &#34;He is too big,&#34; they all said, and the&#10;turkey cock, who had been born into the world with spurs, and&#10;fancied himself really an emperor, puffed himself out like a vessel&#10;in full sail, and flew at the duckling, and became quite red in the&#10;head with passion, so that the poor little thing did not know where&#10;to go, and was quite miserable because he was so ugly and laughed&#10;at by the whole farmyard. So it went on from day to day till it got&#10;worse and worse. The poor duckling was driven about by every one;&#10;even his brothers and sisters were unkind to him, and would say,&#10;&#34;Ah, you ugly creature, I wish the cat would get you,&#34; and his&#10;mother said she wished he had never been born. The ducks pecked&#10;him, the chickens beat him, and the girl who fed the poultry kicked&#10;him with her feet. So at last he ran away, frightening the little&#10;birds in the hedge as he flew over the palings.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;They are afraid of me because I am ugly,&#34; he said. So he&#10;closed his eyes, and flew still farther, until he came out on a&#10;large moor, inhabited by wild ducks. Here he remained the whole&#10;night, feeling very tired and sorrowful.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In the morning, when the wild ducks rose in the air, they&#10;stared at their new comrade. &#34;What sort of a duck are you?&#34; they&#10;all said, coming round him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;He bowed to them, and was as polite as he could be, but he&#10;did not reply to their question. &#34;You are exceedingly ugly,&#34; said&#10;the wild ducks, &#34;but that will not matter if you do not want to&#10;marry one of our family.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Poor thing! he had no thoughts of marriage; all he wanted&#10;was permission to lie among the rushes, and drink some of the water&#10;on the moor. After he had been on the moor two days, there came two&#10;wild geese, or rather goslings, for they had not been out of the&#10;egg long, and were very saucy. &#34;Listen, friend,&#34; said one of them&#10;to the duckling, &#34;you are so ugly, that we like you very well. Will&#10;you go with us, and become a bird of passage? Not far from here is&#10;another moor, in which there are some pretty wild geese, all&#10;unmarried. It is a chance for you to get a wife; you may be lucky,&#10;ugly as you are.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Pop, pop,&#34; sounded in the air, and the two wild geese&#10;fell dead among the rushes, and the water was tinged with blood.&#10;&#34;Pop, pop,&#34; echoed far and wide in the distance, and whole flocks&#10;of wild geese rose up from the rushes. The sound continued from&#10;every direction, for the sportsmen surrounded the moor, and some&#10;were even seated on branches of trees, overlooking the rushes. The&#10;blue smoke from the guns rose like clouds over the dark trees, and&#10;as it floated away across the water, a number of sporting dogs&#10;bounded in among the rushes, which bent beneath them wherever they&#10;went. How they terrified the poor duckling! He turned away his head&#10;to hide it under his wing, and at the same moment a large terrible&#10;dog passed quite near him. His jaws were open, his tongue hung from&#10;his mouth, and his eyes glared fearfully. He thrust his nose close&#10;to the duckling, showing his sharp teeth, and then, &#34;splash,&#10;splash,&#34; he went into the water without touching him, &#34;Oh,&#34; sighed&#10;the duckling, &#34;how thankful I am for being so ugly; even a dog will&#10;not bite me.&#34; And so he lay quite still, while the shot rattled&#10;through the rushes, and gun after gun was fired over him. It was&#10;late in the day before all became quiet, but even then the poor&#10;young thing did not dare to move. He waited quietly for several&#10;hours, and then, after looking carefully around him, hastened away&#10;from the moor as fast as he could. He ran over field and meadow&#10;till a storm arose, and he could hardly struggle against it.&#10;Towards evening, he reached a poor little cottage that seemed ready&#10;to fall, and only remained standing because it could not decide on&#10;which side to fall first. The storm continued so violent, that the&#10;duckling could go no farther; he sat down by the cottage, and then&#10;he noticed that the door was not quite closed in consequence of one&#10;of the hinges having given way. There was therefore a narrow&#10;opening near the bottom large enough for him to slip through, which&#10;he did very quietly, and got a shelter for the night. A woman, a&#10;tom cat, and a hen lived in this cottage. The tom cat, whom the&#10;mistress called, &#34;My little son,&#34; was a great favorite; he could&#10;raise his back, and purr, and could even throw out sparks from his&#10;fur if it were stroked the wrong way. The hen had very short legs,&#10;so she was called &#34;Chickie short legs.&#34; She laid good eggs, and her&#10;mistress loved her as if she had been her own child. In the&#10;morning, the strange visitor was discovered, and the tom cat began&#10;to purr, and the hen to cluck.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What is that noise about?&#34; said the old woman, looking&#10;round the room, but her sight was not very good; therefore, when&#10;she saw the duckling she thought it must be a fat duck, that had&#10;strayed from home. &#34;Oh what a prize!&#34; she exclaimed, &#34;I hope it is&#10;not a drake, for then I shall have some duck&#39;s eggs. I must wait&#10;and see.&#34; So the duckling was allowed to remain on trial for three&#10;weeks, but there were no eggs. Now the tom cat was the master of&#10;the house, and the hen was mistress, and they always said, &#34;We and&#10;the world,&#34; for they believed themselves to be half the world, and&#10;the better half too. The duckling thought that others might hold a&#10;different opinion on the subject, but the hen would not listen to&#10;such doubts. &#34;Can you lay eggs?&#34; she asked. &#34;No.&#34; &#34;Then have the&#10;goodness to hold your tongue.&#34; &#34;Can you raise your back, or purr,&#10;or throw out sparks?&#34; said the tom cat. &#34;No.&#34; &#34;Then you have no&#10;right to express an opinion when sensible people are speaking.&#34; So&#10;the duckling sat in a corner, feeling very low spirited, till the&#10;sunshine and the fresh air came into the room through the open&#10;door, and then he began to feel such a great longing for a swim on&#10;the water, that he could not help telling the hen.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What an absurd idea,&#34; said the hen. &#34;You have nothing&#10;else to do, therefore you have foolish fancies. If you could purr&#10;or lay eggs, they would pass away.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But it is so delightful to swim about on the water,&#34; said&#10;the duckling, &#34;and so refreshing to feel it close over your head,&#10;while you dive down to the bottom.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Delightful, indeed!&#34; said the hen, &#34;why you must be&#10;crazy! Ask the cat, he is the cleverest animal I know, ask him how&#10;he would like to swim about on the water, or to dive under it, for&#10;I will not speak of my own opinion; ask our mistress, the old&#10;woman&#8212;there is no one in the world more clever than she is. Do you&#10;think she would like to swim, or to let the water close over her&#10;head?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You don&#39;t understand me,&#34; said the duckling.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;We don&#39;t understand you? Who can understand you, I&#10;wonder? Do you consider yourself more clever than the cat, or the&#10;old woman? I will say nothing of myself. Don&#39;t imagine such&#10;nonsense, child, and thank your good fortune that you have been&#10;received here. Are you not in a warm room, and in society from&#10;which you may learn something. But you are a chatterer, and your&#10;company is not very agreeable. Believe me, I speak only for your&#10;own good. I may tell you unpleasant truths, but that is a proof of&#10;my friendship. I advise you, therefore, to lay eggs, and learn to&#10;purr as quickly as possible.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I believe I must go out into the world again,&#34; said the&#10;duckling.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, do,&#34; said the hen. So the duckling left the cottage,&#10;and soon found water on which it could swim and dive, but was&#10;avoided by all other animals, because of its ugly appearance.&#10;Autumn came, and the leaves in the forest turned to orange and&#10;gold. then, as winter approached, the wind caught them as they fell&#10;and whirled them in the cold air. The clouds, heavy with hail and&#10;snow-flakes, hung low in the sky, and the raven stood on the ferns&#10;crying, &#34;Croak, croak.&#34; It made one shiver with cold to look at&#10;him. All this was very sad for the poor little duckling. One&#10;evening, just as the sun set amid radiant clouds, there came a&#10;large flock of beautiful birds out of the bushes. The duckling had&#10;never seen any like them before. They were swans, and they curved&#10;their graceful necks, while their soft plumage shown with dazzling&#10;whiteness. They uttered a singular cry, as they spread their&#10;glorious wings and flew away from those cold regions to warmer&#10;countries across the sea. As they mounted higher and higher in the&#10;air, the ugly little duckling felt quite a strange sensation as he&#10;watched them. He whirled himself in the water like a wheel,&#10;stretched out his neck towards them, and uttered a cry so strange&#10;that it frightened himself. Could he ever forget those beautiful,&#10;happy birds; and when at last they were out of his sight, he dived&#10;under the water, and rose again almost beside himself with&#10;excitement. He knew not the names of these birds, nor where they&#10;had flown, but he felt towards them as he had never felt for any&#10;other bird in the world. He was not envious of these beautiful&#10;creatures, but wished to be as lovely as they. Poor ugly creature,&#10;how gladly he would have lived even with the ducks had they only&#10;given him encouragement. The winter grew colder and colder; he was&#10;obliged to swim about on the water to keep it from freezing, but&#10;every night the space on which he swam became smaller and smaller.&#10;At length it froze so hard that the ice in the water crackled as he&#10;moved, and the duckling had to paddle with his legs as well as he&#10;could, to keep the space from closing up. He became exhausted at&#10;last, and lay still and helpless, frozen fast in the&#10;ice.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Early in the morning, a peasant, who was passing by, saw&#10;what had happened. He broke the ice in pieces with his wooden shoe,&#10;and carried the duckling home to his wife. The warmth revived the&#10;poor little creature; but when the children wanted to play with&#10;him, the duckling thought they would do him some harm; so he&#10;started up in terror, fluttered into the milk-pan, and splashed the&#10;milk about the room. Then the woman clapped her hands, which&#10;frightened him still more. He flew first into the butter-cask, then&#10;into the meal-tub, and out again. What a condition he was in! The&#10;woman screamed, and struck at him with the tongs; the children&#10;laughed and screamed, and tumbled over each other, in their efforts&#10;to catch him; but luckily he escaped. The door stood open; the poor&#10;creature could just manage to slip out among the bushes, and lie&#10;down quite exhausted in the newly fallen snow.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It would be very sad, were I to relate all the misery and&#10;privations which the poor little duckling endured during the hard&#10;winter; but when it had passed, he found himself lying one morning&#10;in a moor, amongst the rushes. He felt the warm sun shining, and&#10;heard the lark singing, and saw that all around was beautiful&#10;spring. Then the young bird felt that his wings were strong, as he&#10;flapped them against his sides, and rose high into the air. They&#10;bore him onwards, until he found himself in a large garden, before&#10;he well knew how it had happened. The apple-trees were in full&#10;blossom, and the fragrant elders bent their long green branches&#10;down to the stream which wound round a smooth lawn. Everything&#10;looked beautiful, in the freshness of early spring. From a thicket&#10;close by came three beautiful white swans, rustling their feathers,&#10;and swimming lightly over the smooth water. The duckling remembered&#10;the lovely birds, and felt more strangely unhappy than&#10;ever.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I will fly to those royal birds,&#34; he exclaimed, &#34;and they&#10;will kill me, because I am so ugly, and dare to approach them; but&#10;it does not matter: better be killed by them than pecked by the&#10;ducks, beaten by the hens, pushed about by the maiden who feeds the&#10;poultry, or starved with hunger in the winter.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then he flew to the water, and swam towards the beautiful&#10;swans. The moment they espied the stranger, they rushed to meet him&#10;with outstretched wings.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Kill me,&#34; said the poor bird; and he bent his head down&#10;to the surface of the water, and awaited death.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But what did he see in the clear stream below? His own&#10;image; no longer a dark, gray bird, ugly and disagreeable to look&#10;at, but a graceful and beautiful swan. To be born in a duck&#39;s nest,&#10;in a farmyard, is of no consequence to a bird, if it is hatched&#10;from a swan&#39;s egg. He now felt glad at having suffered sorrow and&#10;trouble, because it enabled him to enjoy so much better all the&#10;pleasure and happiness around him; for the great swans swam round&#10;the new-comer, and stroked his neck with their beaks, as a&#10;welcome.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Into the garden presently came some little children, and&#10;threw bread and cake into the water.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;See,&#34; cried the youngest, &#34;there is a new one;&#34; and the&#10;rest were delighted, and ran to their father and mother, dancing&#10;and clapping their hands, and shouting joyously, &#34;There is another&#10;swan come; a new one has arrived.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then they threw more bread and cake into the water, and&#10;said, &#34;The new one is the most beautiful of all; he is so young and&#10;pretty.&#34; And the old swans bowed their heads before him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then he felt quite ashamed, and hid his head under his&#10;wing; for he did not know what to do, he was so happy, and yet not&#10;at all proud. He had been persecuted and despised for his ugliness,&#10;and now he heard them say he was the most beautiful of all the&#10;birds. Even the elder-tree bent down its bows into the water before&#10;him, and the sun shone warm and bright. Then he rustled his&#10;feathers, curved his slender neck, and cried joyfully, from the&#10;depths of his heart, &#34;I never dreamed of such happiness as this,&#10;while I was an ugly duckling.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;Under the Willow-Tree'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;THE region round the little town of Kjoge is very bleak&#10;and cold. The town lies on the sea shore, which is always&#10;beautiful; but here it might be more beautiful than it is, for on&#10;every side the fields are flat, and it is a long way to the forest.&#10;But when persons reside in a place and get used to it, they can&#10;always find something beautiful in it,&#8212;something for which they&#10;long, even in the most charming spot in the world which is not&#10;home. It must be owned that there are in the outskirts of the town&#10;some humble gardens on the banks of a little stream that runs on&#10;towards the sea, and in summer these gardens look very pretty. Such&#10;indeed was the opinion of two little children, whose parents were&#10;neighbors, and who played in these gardens, and forced their way&#10;from one garden to the other through the gooseberry-bushes that&#10;divided them. In one of the gardens grew an elder-tree, and in the&#10;other an old willow, under which the children were very fond of&#10;playing. They had permission to do so, although the tree stood&#10;close by the stream, and they might easily have fallen into the&#10;water; but the eye of God watches over the little ones, otherwise&#10;they would never be safe. At the same time, these children were&#10;very careful not to go too near the water; indeed, the boy was so&#10;afraid of it, that in the summer, while the other children were&#10;splashing about in the sea, nothing could entice him to join them.&#10;They jeered and laughed at him, and he was obliged to bear it all&#10;as patiently as he could. Once the neighbor&#39;s little girl, Joanna,&#10;dreamed that she was sailing in a boat, and the boy&#8212;Knud was his&#10;name&#8212;waded out in the water to join her, and the water came up to&#10;his neck, and at last closed over his head, and in a moment he had&#10;disappeared. When little Knud heard this dream, it seemed as if he&#10;could not bear the mocking and jeering again; how could he dare to&#10;go into the water now, after Joanna&#39;s dream! He never would do it,&#10;for this dream always satisfied him. The parents of these children,&#10;who were poor, often sat together while Knud and Joanna played in&#10;the gardens or in the road. Along this road&#8212;a row of willow-trees&#10;had been planted to separate it from a ditch on one side of it.&#10;They were not very handsome trees, for the tops had been cut off;&#10;however, they were intended for use, and not for show. The old&#10;willow-tree in the garden was much handsomer, and therefore the&#10;children were very fond of sitting under it. The town had a large&#10;market-place; and at the fair-time there would be whole rows, like&#10;streets, of tents and booths containing silks and ribbons, and toys&#10;and cakes, and everything that could be wished for. There were&#10;crowds of people, and sometimes the weather would be rainy, and&#10;splash with moisture the woollen jackets of the peasants; but it&#10;did not destroy the beautiful fragrance of the honey-cakes and&#10;gingerbread with which one booth was filled; and the best of it&#10;was, that the man who sold these cakes always lodged during the&#10;fair-time with little Knud&#39;s parents. So every now and then he had&#10;a present of gingerbread, and of course Joanna always had a share.&#10;And, more delightful still, the gingerbread seller knew all sorts&#10;of things to tell and could even relate stories about his own&#10;gingerbread. So one evening he told them a story that made such a&#10;deep impression on the children that they never forgot it; and&#10;therefore I think we may as well hear it too, for it is not very&#10;long.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Once upon a time,&#34; said he, &#34;there lay on my counter two&#10;gingerbread cakes, one in the shape of a man wearing a hat, the&#10;other of a maiden without a bonnet. Their faces were on the side&#10;that was uppermost, for on the other side they looked very&#10;different. Most people have a best side to their characters, which&#10;they take care to show to the world. On the left, just where the&#10;heart is, the gingerbread man had an almond stuck in to represent&#10;it, but the maiden was honey cake all over. They were placed on the&#10;counter as samples, and after lying there a long time they at last&#10;fell in love with each other; but neither of them spoke of it to&#10;the other, as they should have done if they expected anything to&#10;follow. &#39;He is a man, he ought to speak the first word,&#39; thought&#10;the gingerbread maiden; but she felt quite happy&#8212;she was sure that&#10;her love was returned. But his thoughts were far more ambitious, as&#10;the thoughts of a man often are. He dreamed that he was a real&#10;street boy, that he possessed four real pennies, and that he had&#10;bought the gingerbread lady, and ate her up. And so they lay on the&#10;counter for days and weeks, till they grew hard and dry; but the&#10;thoughts of the maiden became ever more tender and womanly. &#39;Ah&#10;well, it is enough for me that I have been able to live on the same&#10;counter with him,&#39; said she one day; when suddenly, &#39;crack,&#39; and&#10;she broke in two. &#39;Ah,&#39; said the gingerbread man to himself, &#39;if&#10;she had only known of my love, she would have kept together a&#10;little longer.&#39; And here they both are, and that is their history,&#34;&#10;said the cake man. &#34;You think the history of their lives and their&#10;silent love, which never came to anything, very remarkable; and&#10;there they are for you.&#34; So saying, he gave Joanna the gingerbread&#10;man, who was still quite whole&#8212;and to Knud the broken maiden; but&#10;the children had been so much impressed by the story, that they had&#10;not the heart to eat the lovers up.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The next day they went into the churchyard, and took the&#10;two cake figures with them, and sat down under the church wall,&#10;which was covered with luxuriant ivy in summer and winter, and&#10;looked as if hung with rich tapestry. They stuck up the two&#10;gingerbread figures in the sunshine among the green leaves, and&#10;then told the story, and all about the silent love which came to&#10;nothing, to a group of children. They called it, &#34;love,&#34; because&#10;the story was so lovely, and the other children had the same&#10;opinion. But when they turned to look at the gingerbread pair, the&#10;broken maiden was gone! A great boy, out of wickedness, had eaten&#10;her up. At first the children cried about it; but afterwards,&#10;thinking very probably that the poor lover ought not to be left&#10;alone in the world, they ate him up too: but they never forgot the&#10;story.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The two children still continued to play together by the&#10;elder-tree, and under the willow; and the little maiden sang&#10;beautiful songs, with a voice that was as clear as a bell. Knud, on&#10;the contrary, had not a note of music in him, but knew the words of&#10;the songs, and that of course is something. The people of Kjoge,&#10;and even the rich wife of the man who kept the fancy shop, would&#10;stand and listen while Joanna was singing, and say, &#34;She has really&#10;a very sweet voice.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Those were happy days; but they could not last forever.&#10;The neighbors were separated, the mother of the little girl was&#10;dead, and her father had thoughts of marrying again and of residing&#10;in the capital, where he had been promised a very lucrative&#10;appointment as messenger. The neighbors parted with tears, the&#10;children wept sadly; but their parents promised that they should&#10;write to each other at least once a year.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;After this, Knud was bound apprentice to a shoemaker; he&#10;was growing a great boy, and could not be allowed to run wild any&#10;longer. Besides, he was going to be confirmed. Ah, how happy he&#10;would have been on that festal day in Copenhagen with little&#10;Joanna; but he still remained at Kjoge, and had never seen the&#10;great city, though the town is not five miles from it. But far&#10;across the bay, when the sky was clear, the towers of Copenhagen&#10;could be seen; and on the day of his confirmation he saw distinctly&#10;the golden cross on the principal church glittering in the sun. How&#10;often his thoughts were with Joanna! but did she think of him? Yes.&#10;About Christmas came a letter from her father to Knud&#39;s parents,&#10;which stated that they were going on very well in Copenhagen, and&#10;mentioning particularly that Joanna&#39;s beautiful voice was likely to&#10;bring her a brilliant fortune in the future. She was engaged to&#10;sing at a concert, and she had already earned money by singing, out&#10;of which she sent her dear neighbors at Kjoge a whole dollar, for&#10;them to make merry on Christmas eve, and they were to drink her&#10;health. She had herself added this in a postscript, and in the same&#10;postscript she wrote, &#34;Kind regards to Knud.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The good neighbors wept, although the news was so&#10;pleasant; but they wept tears of joy. Knud&#39;s thoughts had been&#10;daily with Joanna, and now he knew that she also had thought of&#10;him; and the nearer the time came for his apprenticeship to end,&#10;the clearer did it appear to him that he loved Joanna, and that she&#10;must be his wife; and a smile came on his lips at the thought, and&#10;at one time he drew the thread so fast as he worked, and pressed&#10;his foot so hard against the knee strap, that he ran the awl into&#10;his finger; but what did he care for that? He was determined not to&#10;play the dumb lover as both the gingerbread cakes had done; the&#10;story was a good lesson to him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;At length he become a journeyman; and then, for the first&#10;time, he prepared for a journey to Copenhagen, with his knapsack&#10;packed and ready. A master was expecting him there, and he thought&#10;of Joanna, and how glad she would be to see him. She was now&#10;seventeen, and he nineteen years old. He wanted to buy a gold ring&#10;for her in Kjoge, but then he recollected how far more beautiful&#10;such things would be in Copenhagen. So he took leave of his&#10;parents, and on a rainy day, late in the autumn, wandered forth on&#10;foot from the town of his birth. The leaves were falling from the&#10;trees; and, by the time he arrived at his new master&#39;s in the great&#10;metropolis, he was wet through. On the following Sunday he intended&#10;to pay his first visit to Joanna&#39;s father. When the day came, the&#10;new journeyman&#39;s clothes were brought out, and a new hat, which he&#10;had brought in Kjoge. The hat became him very well, for hitherto he&#10;had only worn a cap. He found the house that he sought easily, but&#10;had to mount so many stairs that he became quite giddy; it&#10;surprised him to find how people lived over one another in this&#10;dreadful town.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;On entering a room in which everything denoted prosperity,&#10;Joanna&#39;s father received him very kindly. The new wife was a&#10;stranger to him, but she shook hands with him, and offered him&#10;coffee.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Joanna will be very glad to see you,&#34; said her father.&#10;&#34;You have grown quite a nice young man, you shall see her&#10;presently; she is a good child, and is the joy of my heart, and,&#10;please God, she will continue to be so; she has her own room now,&#10;and pays us rent for it.&#34; And the father knocked quite politely at&#10;a door, as if he were a stranger, and then they both went in. How&#10;pretty everything was in that room! a more beautiful apartment&#10;could not be found in the whole town of Kjoge; the queen herself&#10;could scarcely be better accommodated. There were carpets, and&#10;rugs, and window curtains hanging to the ground. Pictures and&#10;flowers were scattered about. There was a velvet chair, and a&#10;looking-glass against the wall, into which a person might be in&#10;danger of stepping, for it was as large as a door. All this Knud&#10;saw at a glance, and yet, in truth, he saw nothing but Joanna. She&#10;was quite grown up, and very different from what Knud had fancied&#10;her, and a great deal more beautiful. In all Kjoge there was not a&#10;girl like her; and how graceful she looked, although her glance at&#10;first was odd, and not familiar; but for a moment only, then she&#10;rushed towards him as if she would have kissed him; she did not,&#10;however, although she was very near it. Yes, she really was joyful&#10;at seeing the friend of her childhood once more, and the tears even&#10;stood in her eyes. Then she asked so many questions about Knud&#39;s&#10;parents, and everything, even to the elder-tree and the willow,&#10;which she called &#34;elder-mother and willow-father,&#34; as if they had&#10;been human beings; and so, indeed, they might be, quite as much as&#10;the gingerbread cakes. Then she talked about them, and the story of&#10;their silent love, and how they lay on the counter together and&#10;split in two; and then she laughed heartily; but the blood rushed&#10;into Knud&#39;s cheeks, and his heart beat quickly. Joanna was not&#10;proud at all; he noticed that through her he was invited by her&#10;parents to remain the whole evening with them, and she poured out&#10;the tea and gave him a cup herself; and afterwards she took a book&#10;and read aloud to them, and it seemed to Knud as if the story was&#10;all about himself and his love, for it agreed so well with his own&#10;thoughts. And then she sang a simple song, which, through her&#10;singing, became a true story, and as if she poured forth the&#10;feelings of her own heart.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Oh,&#34; he thought, &#34;she knows I am fond of her.&#34; The tears&#10;he could not restrain rolled down his cheeks, and he was unable to&#10;utter a single word; it seemed as if he had been struck&#10;dumb.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;When he left, she pressed his hand, and said, &#34;You have a&#10;kind heart, Knud: remain always as you are now.&#34; What an evening of&#10;happiness this had been; to sleep after it was impossible, and Knud&#10;did not sleep.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;At parting, Joanna&#39;s father had said, &#34;Now, you won&#39;t&#10;quite forget us; you must not let the whole winter go by without&#10;paying us another visit;&#34; so that Knud felt himself free to go&#10;again the following Sunday evening, and so he did. But every&#10;evening after working hours&#8212;and they worked by candle-light then&#8212;he&#10;walked out into the town, and through the street in which Joanna&#10;lived, to look up at her window. It was almost always lighted up;&#10;and one evening he saw the shadow of her face quite plainly on the&#10;window blind; that was a glorious evening for him. His master&#39;s&#10;wife did not like his always going out in the evening, idling,&#10;wasting time, as she called it, and she shook her head.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But his master only smiled, and said, &#34;He is a young man,&#10;my dear, you know.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;On Sunday I shall see her,&#34; said Knud to himself, &#34;and I&#10;will tell her that I love her with my whole heart and soul, and&#10;that she must be my little wife. I know I am now only a poor&#10;journeyman shoemaker, but I will work and strive, and become a&#10;master in time. Yes, I will speak to her; nothing comes from silent&#10;love. I learnt that from the gingerbread-cake story.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Sunday came, but when Knud arrived, they were all&#10;unfortunately invited out to spend the evening, and were obliged to&#10;tell him so.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Joanna pressed his hand, and said, &#34;Have you ever been to&#10;the theatre? you must go once; I sing there on Wednesday, and if&#10;you have time on that day, I will send you a ticket; my father&#10;knows where your master lives.&#34; How kind this was of her! And on&#10;Wednesday, about noon, Knud received a sealed packet with no&#10;address, but the ticket was inside; and in the evening Knud went,&#10;for the first time in his life, to a theatre. And what did he see?&#10;He saw Joanna, and how beautiful and charming she looked! He&#10;certainly saw her being married to a stranger, but that was all in&#10;the play, and only a pretence; Knud well knew that. She could never&#10;have the heart, he thought, to send him a ticket to go and see it,&#10;if it had been real. So he looked on, and when all the people&#10;applauded and clapped their hands, he shouted &#34;hurrah.&#34; He could&#10;see that even the king smiled at Joanna, and seemed delighted with&#10;her singing. How small Knud felt; but then he loved her so dearly,&#10;and thought she loved him, and the man must speak the first word,&#10;as the gingerbread maiden had thought. Ah, how much there was for&#10;him in that childish story. As soon as Sunday arrived, he went&#10;again, and felt as if he were about to enter on holy ground. Joanna&#10;was alone to welcome him, nothing could be more&#10;fortunate.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I am so glad you are come,&#34; she said. I was thinking of&#10;sending my father for you, but I had a presentiment that you would&#10;be here this evening. The fact is, I wanted to tell you that I am&#10;going to France. I shall start on Friday. It is necessary for me to&#10;go there, if I wish to become a first-rate performer.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Poor Knud! it seemed to him as if the whole room was&#10;whirling round with him. His courage failed, and he felt as if his&#10;heart would burst. He kept down the tears, but it was easy to see&#10;how sorrowful he was.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You honest, faithful soul,&#34; she exclaimed; and the words&#10;loosened Knud&#39;s tongue, and he told her how truly he had loved her,&#10;and that she must be his wife; and as he said this, he saw Joanna&#10;change color, and turn pale. She let his hand fall, and said,&#10;earnestly and mournfully, &#34;Knud, do not make yourself and me&#10;unhappy. I will always be a good sister to you, one in whom you can&#10;trust; but I can never be anything more.&#34; And she drew her white&#10;hand over his burning forehead, and said, &#34;God gives strength to&#10;bear a great deal, if we only strive ourselves to&#10;endure.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;At this moment her stepmother came into the room, and&#10;Joanna said quickly, &#34;Knud is so unhappy, because I am going away;&#34;&#10;and it appeared as if they had only been talking of her journey.&#10;&#34;Come, be a man&#34; she added, placing her hand on his shoulder; &#34;you&#10;are still a child, and you must be good and reasonable, as you were&#10;when we were both children, and played together under the&#10;willow-tree.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Knud listened, but he felt as if the world had slid out of&#10;its course. His thoughts were like a loose thread fluttering to and&#10;fro in the wind. He stayed, although he could not tell whether she&#10;had asked him to do so. But she was kind and gentle to him; she&#10;poured out his tea, and sang to him; but the song had not the old&#10;tone in it, although it was wonderfully beautiful, and made his&#10;heart feel ready to burst. And then he rose to go. He did not offer&#10;his hand, but she seized it, and said&#8212;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Will you not shake hands with your sister at parting, my&#10;old playfellow?&#34; and she smiled through the tears that were rolling&#10;down her cheeks. Again she repeated the word &#34;brother,&#34; which was a&#10;great consolation certainly; and thus they parted.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;She sailed to France, and Knud wandered about the muddy&#10;streets of Copenhagen. The other journeymen in the shop asked him&#10;why he looked so gloomy, and wanted him to go and amuse himself&#10;with them, as he was still a young man. So he went with them to a&#10;dancing-room. He saw many handsome girls there, but none like&#10;Joanna; and here, where he thought to forget her, she was more&#10;life-like before his mind than ever. &#34;God gives us strength to bear&#10;much, if we try to do our best,&#34; she had said; and as he thought of&#10;this, a devout feeling came into his mind, and he folded his hands.&#10;Then, as the violins played and the girls danced round the room, he&#10;started; for it seemed to him as if he were in a place where he&#10;ought not to have brought Joanna, for she was here with him in his&#10;heart; and so he went out at once. As he went through the streets&#10;at a quick pace, he passed the house where she used to live; it was&#10;all dark, empty, and lonely. But the world went on its course, and&#10;Knud was obliged to go on too.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Winter came; the water was frozen, and everything seemed&#10;buried in a cold grave. But when spring returned, and the first&#10;steamer prepared to sail, Knud was seized with a longing to wander&#10;forth into the world, but not to France. So he packed his knapsack,&#10;and travelled through Germany, going from town to town, but finding&#10;neither rest or peace. It was not till he arrived at the glorious&#10;old town of Nuremberg that he gained the mastery over himself, and&#10;rested his weary feet; and here he remained.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Nuremberg is a wonderful old city, and looks as if it had&#10;been cut out of an old picture-book. The streets seem to have&#10;arranged themselves according to their own fancy, and as if the&#10;houses objected to stand in rows or rank and file. Gables, with&#10;little towers, ornamented columns, and statues, can be seen even to&#10;the city gate; and from the singular-shaped roofs, waterspouts,&#10;formed like dragons, or long lean dogs, extend far across to the&#10;middle of the street. Here, in the market-place, stood Knud, with&#10;his knapsack on his back, close to one of the old fountains which&#10;are so beautifully adorned with figures, scriptural and historical,&#10;and which spring up between the sparkling jets of water. A pretty&#10;servant-maid was just filling her pails, and she gave Knud a&#10;refreshing draught; she had a handful of roses, and she gave him&#10;one, which appeared to him like a good omen for the future. From a&#10;neighboring church came the sounds of music, and the familiar tones&#10;reminded him of the organ at home at Kjoge; so he passed into the&#10;great cathedral. The sunshine streamed through the painted glass&#10;windows, and between two lofty slender pillars. His thoughts became&#10;prayerful, and calm peace rested on his soul. He next sought and&#10;found a good master in Nuremberg, with whom he stayed and learnt&#10;the German language.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The old moat round the town had been converted into a&#10;number of little kitchen gardens; but the high walls, with their&#10;heavy-looking towers, are still standing. Inside these walls the&#10;ropemaker twisted his ropes along a walk built like a gallery, and&#10;in the cracks and crevices of the walls elderbushes grow and&#10;stretch their green boughs over the small houses which stand below.&#10;In one of these houses lived the master for whom Knud worked; and&#10;over the little garret window where he sat, the elder-tree waved&#10;its branches. Here he dwelt through one summer and winter, but when&#10;spring came again, he could endure it no longer. The elder was in&#10;blossom, and its fragrance was so homelike, that he fancied himself&#10;back again in the gardens of Kjoge. So Knud left his master, and&#10;went to work for another who lived farther in the town, where no&#10;elder grew. His workshop was quite close to one of the old stone&#10;bridges, near to a water-mill, round which the roaring stream&#10;rushed and foamed always, yet restrained by the neighboring houses,&#10;whose old, decayed balconies hung over, and seemed ready to fall&#10;into the water. Here grew no elder; here was not even a flower-pot,&#10;with its little green plant; but just opposite the workshop stood a&#10;great willow-tree, which seemed to hold fast to the house for fear&#10;of being carried away by the water. It stretched its branches over&#10;the stream just as those of the willow-tree in the garden at Kjoge&#10;had spread over the river. Yes, he had indeed gone from&#10;elder-mother to willow-father. There was a something about the tree&#10;here, especially in the moonlight nights, that went direct to his&#10;heart; yet it was not in reality the moonlight, but the old tree&#10;itself. However, he could not endure it: and why? Ask the willow,&#10;ask the blossoming elder! At all events, he bade farewell to&#10;Nuremberg and journeyed onwards. He never spoke of Joanna to any&#10;one; his sorrow was hidden in his heart. The old childish story of&#10;the two cakes had a deep meaning for him. He understood now why the&#10;gingerbread man had a bitter almond in his left side; his was the&#10;feeling of bitterness, and Joanna, so mild and friendly, was&#10;represented by the honeycake maiden. As he thought upon all this,&#10;the strap of his knapsack pressed across his chest so that he could&#10;hardly breathe; he loosened it, but gained no relief. He saw but&#10;half the world around him; the other half he carried with him in&#10;his inward thoughts; and this is the condition in which he left&#10;Nuremberg. Not till he caught sight of the lofty mountains did the&#10;world appear more free to him; his thoughts were attracted to outer&#10;objects, and tears came into his eyes. The Alps appeared to him&#10;like the wings of earth folded together; unfolded, they would&#10;display the variegated pictures of dark woods, foaming waters,&#10;spreading clouds, and masses of snow. &#34;At the last day,&#34; thought&#10;he, &#34;the earth will unfold its great wings, and soar upwards to the&#10;skies, there to burst like a soap-bubble in the radiant glance of&#10;the Deity. Oh,&#34; sighed he, &#34;that the last day were&#10;come!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Silently he wandered on through the country of the Alps,&#10;which seemed to him like a fruit garden, covered with soft turf.&#10;From the wooden balconies of the houses the young lacemakers nodded&#10;as he passed. The summits of the mountains glowed in the red&#10;evening sunset, and the green lakes beneath the dark trees&#10;reflected the glow. Then he thought of the sea coast by the bay&#10;Kjoge, with a longing in his heart that was, however, without pain.&#10;There, where the Rhine rolls onward like a great billow, and&#10;dissolves itself into snowflakes, where glistening clouds are ever&#10;changing as if here was the place of their creation, while the&#10;rainbow flutters about them like a many-colored ribbon, there did&#10;Knud think of the water-mill at Kjoge, with its rushing, foaming&#10;waters. Gladly would he have remained in the quiet Rhenish town,&#10;but there were too many elders and willow-trees.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;So he travelled onwards, over a grand, lofty chain of&#10;mountains, over rugged,&#8212;rocky precipices, and along roads that hung&#10;on the mountain&#39;s side like a swallow&#39;s nest. The waters foamed in&#10;the depths below him. The clouds lay beneath him. He wandered on,&#10;treading upon Alpine roses, thistles, and snow, with the summer sun&#10;shining upon him, till at length he bid farewell to the lands of&#10;the north. Then he passed on under the shade of blooming&#10;chestnut-trees, through vineyards, and fields of Indian corn, till&#10;conscious that the mountains were as a wall between him and his&#10;early recollections; and he wished it to be so.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Before him lay a large and splendid city, called Milan,&#10;and here he found a German master who engaged him as a workman. The&#10;master and his wife, in whose workshop he was employed, were an&#10;old, pious couple; and the two old people became quite fond of the&#10;quiet journeyman, who spoke but little, but worked more, and led a&#10;pious, Christian life; and even to himself it seemed as if God had&#10;removed the heavy burden from his heart. His greatest pleasure was&#10;to climb, now and then, to the roof of the noble church, which was&#10;built of white marble. The pointed towers, the decorated and open&#10;cloisters, the stately columns, the white statues which smiled upon&#10;him from every corner and porch and arch,&#8212;all, even the church&#10;itself, seemed to him to have been formed from the snow of his&#10;native land. Above him was the blue sky; below him, the city and&#10;the wide-spreading plains of Lombardy; and towards the north, the&#10;lofty mountains, covered with perpetual snow. And then he thought&#10;of the church of Kjoge, with its red, ivy-clad walls, but he had no&#10;longing to go there; here, beyond the mountains, he would die and&#10;be buried.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Three years had passed away since he left his home; one&#10;year of that time he had dwelt at Milan.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;One day his master took him into the town; not to the&#10;circus in which riders performed, but to the opera, a large&#10;building, itself a sight well worth seeing. The seven tiers of&#10;boxes, which reached from the ground to a dizzy height, near the&#10;ceiling, were hung with rich, silken curtains; and in them were&#10;seated elegantly-dressed ladies, with bouquets of flowers in their&#10;hands. The gentlemen were also in full dress, and many of them wore&#10;decorations of gold and silver. The place was so brilliantly&#10;lighted that it seemed like sunshine, and glorious music rolled&#10;through the building. Everything looked more beautiful than in the&#10;theatre at Copenhagen, but then Joanna had been there, and&#8212;could it&#10;be? Yes&#8212;it was like magic,&#8212;she was here also: for, when the curtain&#10;rose, there stood Joanna, dressed in silk and gold, and with a&#10;golden crown upon her head. She sang, he thought, as only an angel&#10;could sing; and then she stepped forward to the front and smiled,&#10;as only Joanna could smile, and looked directly at Knud. Poor Knud!&#10;he seized his master&#39;s hand, and cried out loud, &#34;Joanna,&#34; but no&#10;one heard him, excepting his master, for the music sounded above&#10;everything.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, yes, it is Joanna,&#34; said his master; and he drew&#10;forth a printed bill, and pointed to her name, which was there in&#10;full. Then it was not a dream. All the audience applauded her, and&#10;threw wreaths of flowers at her; and every time she went away they&#10;called for her again, so that she was always coming and going. In&#10;the street the people crowded round her carriage, and drew it away&#10;themselves without the horses. Knud was in the foremost row, and&#10;shouted as joyously as the rest; and when the carriage stopped&#10;before a brilliantly lighted house, Knud placed himself close to&#10;the door of her carriage. It flew open, and she stepped out; the&#10;light fell upon her dear face, and he could see that she smiled as&#10;she thanked them, and appeared quite overcome. Knud looked straight&#10;in her face, and she looked at him, but she did not recognize him.&#10;A man, with a glittering star on his breast, gave her his arm, and&#10;people said the two were engaged to be married. Then Knud went home&#10;and packed up his knapsack; he felt he must return to the home of&#10;his childhood, to the elder-tree and the willow. &#34;Ah, under that&#10;willow-tree!&#34; A man may live a whole life in one single&#10;hour.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The old couple begged him to remain, but words were&#10;useless. In vain they reminded him that winter was coming, and that&#10;the snow had already fallen on the mountains. He said he could&#10;easily follow the track of the closely-moving carriages, for which&#10;a path must be kept clear, and with nothing but his knapsack on his&#10;back, and leaning on his stick, he could step along briskly. So he&#10;turned his steps to the mountains, ascended one side and descended&#10;the other, still going northward till his strength began to fail,&#10;and not a house or village could be seen. The stars shone in the&#10;sky above him, and down in the valley lights glittered like stars,&#10;as if another sky were beneath him; but his head was dizzy and his&#10;feet stumbled, and he felt ill. The lights in the valley grew&#10;brighter and brighter, and more numerous, and he could see them&#10;moving to and fro, and then he understood that there must be a&#10;village in the distance; so he exerted his failing strength to&#10;reach it, and at length obtained shelter in a humble lodging. He&#10;remained there that night and the whole of the following day, for&#10;his body required rest and refreshment, and in the valley there was&#10;rain and a thaw. But early in the morning of the third day, a man&#10;came with an organ and played one of the melodies of home; and&#10;after that Knud could remain there no longer, so he started again&#10;on his journey toward the north. He travelled for many days with&#10;hasty steps, as if he were trying to reach home before all whom he&#10;remembered should die; but he spoke to no one of this longing. No&#10;one would have believed or understood this sorrow of his heart, the&#10;deepest that can be felt by human nature. Such grief is not for the&#10;world; it is not entertaining even to friends, and poor Knud had no&#10;friends; he was a stranger, wandering through strange lands to his&#10;home in the north.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;He was walking one evening through the public roads, the&#10;country around him was flatter, with fields and meadows, the air&#10;had a frosty feeling. A willow-tree grew by the roadside,&#10;everything reminded him of home. He felt very tired; so he sat down&#10;under the tree, and very soon began to nod, then his eyes closed in&#10;sleep. Yet still he seemed conscious that the willow-tree was&#10;stretching its branches over him; in his dreaming state the tree&#10;appeared like a strong, old man&#8212;the &#34;willow-father&#34; himself, who&#10;had taken his tired son up in his arms to carry him back to the&#10;land of home, to the garden of his childhood, on the bleak open&#10;shores of Kjoge. And then he dreamed that it was really the&#10;willow-tree itself from Kjoge, which had travelled out in the world&#10;to seek him, and now had found him and carried him back into the&#10;little garden on the banks of the streamlet; and there stood&#10;Joanna, in all her splendor, with the golden crown on her head, as&#10;he had last seen her, to welcome him back. And then there appeared&#10;before him two remarkable shapes, which looked much more like human&#10;beings than when he had seen them in his childhood; they were&#10;changed, but he remembered that they were the two gingerbread&#10;cakes, the man and the woman, who had shown their best sides to the&#10;world and looked so good.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;We thank you,&#34; they said to Knud, &#34;for you have loosened&#10;our tongues; we have learnt from you that thoughts should be spoken&#10;freely, or nothing will come of them; and now something has come of&#10;our thoughts, for we are engaged to be married.&#34; Then they walked&#10;away, hand-in-hand, through the streets of Kjoge, looking very&#10;respectable on the best side, which they were quite right to show.&#10;They turned their steps to the church, and Knud and Joanna followed&#10;them, also walking hand-in-hand; there stood the church, as of old,&#10;with its red walls, on which the green ivy grew.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The great church door flew open wide, and as they walked&#10;up the broad aisle, soft tones of music sounded from the organ.&#10;&#34;Our master first,&#34; said the gingerbread pair, making room for Knud&#10;and Joanna. As they knelt at the altar, Joanna bent her head over&#10;him, and cold, icy tears fell on his face from her eyes. They were&#10;indeed tears of ice, for her heart was melting towards him through&#10;his strong love, and as her tears fell on his burning cheeks he&#10;awoke. He was still sitting under the willow-tree in a strange&#10;land, on a cold winter evening, with snow and hail falling from the&#10;clouds, and beating upon his face.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That was the most delightful hour of my life,&#34; said he,&#10;&#34;although it was only a dream. Oh, let me dream again.&#34; Then he&#10;closed his eyes once more, and slept and dreamed.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Towards morning there was a great fall of snow; the wind&#10;drifted it over him, but he still slept on. The villagers came&#10;forth to go to church; by the roadside they found a workman seated,&#10;but he was dead! frozen to death under a willow-tree.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;In the Uttermost Parts of the Sea'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;SOME years ago, large ships were sent towards the north&#10;pole, to explore the distant coasts, and to try how far men could&#10;penetrate into those unknown regions. For more than a year one of&#10;these ships had been pushing its way northward, amid snow and ice,&#10;and the sailors had endured many hardships; till at length winter&#10;set in, and the sun entirely disappeared; for many weeks there&#10;would be constant night. All around, as far as the eye could reach,&#10;nothing could be seen but fields of ice, in which the ship remained&#10;stuck fast. The snow lay piled up in great heaps, and of these the&#10;sailors made huts, in the form of bee-hives, some of them as large&#10;and spacious as one of the &#34;Huns&#39; graves,&#34; and others only&#10;containing room enough to hold three or four men. It was not quite&#10;dark; the northern lights shot forth red and blue flames, like&#10;continuous fireworks, and the snow glittered, and reflected back&#10;the light, so that the night here was one long twilight. When the&#10;moon was brightest, the natives came in crowds to see the sailors.&#10;They had a very singular appearance in their rough, hairy dresses&#10;of fur, and riding in sledges over the ice. They brought with them&#10;furs and skins in great abundance, so that the snow-houses were&#10;soon provided with warm carpets, and the furs also served for the&#10;sailors to wrap themselves in, when they slept under the roofs of&#10;snow, while outside it was freezing with a cold far more severe&#10;than in the winter with us. In our country it was still autumn,&#10;though late in the season; and they thought of that in their&#10;distant exile, and often pictured to themselves the yellow leaves&#10;on the trees at home. Their watches pointed to the hours of&#10;evening, and time to go to sleep, although in these regions it was&#10;now always night.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;In one of the huts, two of the men laid themselves down to&#10;rest. The younger of these men had brought with him from home his&#10;best, his dearest treasure&#8212;a Bible, which his grandmother had given&#10;him on his departure. Every night the sacred volume rested under&#10;his head, and he had known from his childhood what was written in&#10;it. Every day he read in the book, and while stretched on his cold&#10;couch, the holy words he had learnt would come into his mind: &#34;If I&#10;take the wings of the morning, and fly to the uttermost parts of&#10;the sea, even there Thou art with me, and Thy right hand shall&#10;uphold me;&#34; and under the influence of that faith which these holy&#10;words inspired, sleep came upon him, and dreams, which are the&#10;manifestations of God to the spirit. The soul lives and acts, while&#10;the body is at rest. He felt this life in him, and it was as if he&#10;heard the sound of dear, well-known melodies, as if the breezes of&#10;summer floated around him; and over his couch shone a ray of&#10;brightness, as if it were shining through the covering of his&#10;snow-roof. He lifted his head, and saw that the bright gleaming was&#10;not the reflection of the glittering snow, but the dazzling&#10;brightness of the pinions of a mighty angel, into whose beaming&#10;face he was gazing. As from the cup of a lily, the angel rose from&#10;amidst the leaves of the Bible; and, stretching out his arm, the&#10;walls of the hut sunk down, as though they had been formed of a&#10;light, airy veil of mist, and the green hills and meadows of home,&#10;with its ruddy woods, lay spread around him in the quiet sunshine&#10;of a lovely autumn day. The nest of the stork was empty, but ripe&#10;fruit still hung on the wild apple-tree, although the leaves had&#10;fallen. The red hips gleamed on the hedges, and the starling which&#10;hung in the green cage outside the window of the peasant&#39;s hut,&#10;which was his home, whistled the tune which he had taught him. His&#10;grandmother hung green birds&#39;-food around the cage, as he, her&#10;grandson, had been accustomed to do. The daughter of the village&#10;blacksmith, who was young and fair, stood at the well, drawing&#10;water. She nodded to the grandmother, and the old woman nodded to&#10;her, and pointed to a letter which had come from a long way off.&#10;That very morning the letter had arrived from the cold regions of&#10;the north; there, where the absent one was sweetly sleeping under&#10;the protecting hand of God. They laughed and wept over the letter;&#10;and he, far away, amid ice and snow, under the shadow of the&#10;angel&#39;s wings, wept and smiled with them in spirit; for he saw and&#10;heard it all in his dream. From the letter they read aloud the&#10;words of Holy Writ: &#34;In the uttermost parts of the sea, Thy right&#10;hand shall uphold me.&#34; And as the angel spread his wings like a&#10;veil over the sleeper, there was the sound of beautiful music and a&#10;hymn. Then the vision fled. It was dark again in the snow-hut: but&#10;the Bible still rested beneath his head, and faith and hope dwelt&#10;in his heart. God was with him, and he carried home in his heart,&#10;even &#34;in the uttermost parts of the sea.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;What One Can Invent'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;There was once a young man who was studying to be a poet.&#10;He wanted to become one by Easter, and to marry, and to live by&#10;poetry. To write poems, he knew, only consists in being able to&#10;invent something; but he could not invent anything. He had been&#10;born too late&#8212;everything had been taken up before he came into the&#10;world, and everything had been written and told about.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Happy people who were born a thousand years ago!&#34; said&#10;he. &#34;It was an easy matter for them to become immortal. Happy even&#10;was he who was born a hundred years ago, for then there was still&#10;something about which a poem could be written. Now the world is&#10;written out, and what can I write poetry about?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then he studied till he became ill and wretched, the&#10;wretched man! No doctor could help him, but perhaps the wise woman&#10;could. She lived in the little house by the wayside, where the gate&#10;is that she opened for those who rode and drove. But she could do&#10;more than unlock the gate. She was wiser than the doctor who drives&#10;in his own carriage and pays tax for his rank.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I must go to her,&#34; said the young man.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The house in which she dwelt was small and neat, but&#10;dreary to behold, for there were no flowers near it&#8212;no trees. By&#10;the door stood a bee-hive, which was very useful. There was also a&#10;little potato-field, very useful, and an earth bank, with sloe&#10;bushes upon it, which had done blossoming, and now bore fruit,&#10;sloes, that draw one&#39;s mouth together if one tastes them before the&#10;frost has touched them.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That&#39;s a true picture of our poetryless time, that I see&#10;before me now,&#34; thought the young man; and that was at least a&#10;thought, a grain of gold that he found by the door of the wise&#10;woman.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Write that down!&#34; said she. &#34;Even crumbs are bread. I&#10;know why you come hither. You cannot invent anything, and yet you&#10;want to be a poet by Easter.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Everything has been written down,&#34; said he. &#34;Our time is&#10;not the old time.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No,&#34; said the woman. &#34;In the old time wise women were&#10;burnt, and poets went about with empty stomachs, and very much out&#10;at elbows. The present time is good, it is the best of times; but&#10;you have not the right way of looking at it. Your ear is not&#10;sharpened to hear, and I fancy you do not say the Lord&#39;s Prayer in&#10;the evening. There is plenty here to write poems about, and to tell&#10;of, for any one who knows the way. You can read it in the fruits of&#10;the earth, you can draw it from the flowing and the standing water;&#10;but you must understand how&#8212;you must understand how to catch a&#10;sunbeam. Now just you try my spectacles on, and put my ear-trumpet&#10;to your ear, and then pray to God, and leave off thinking of&#10;yourself&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The last was a very difficult thing to do&#8212;more than a wise&#10;woman ought to ask.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;He received the spectacles and the ear-trumpet, and was&#10;posted in the middle of the potato-field. She put a great potato&#10;into his hand. Sounds came from within it; there came a song with&#10;words, the history of the potato, an every-day story in ten parts,&#10;an interesting story. And ten lines were enough to tell it&#10;in.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And what did the potato sing?&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;She sang of herself and of her family, of the arrival of&#10;the potato in Europe, of the misrepresentation to which she had&#10;been exposed before she was acknowledged, as she is now, to be a&#10;greater treasure than a lump of gold.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;We were distributed, by the King&#39;s command, from the&#10;council-houses through the various towns, and proclamation was made&#10;of our great value; but no one believed in it, or even understood&#10;how to plant us. One man dug a hole in the earth and threw in his&#10;whole bushel of potatoes; another put one potato here and another&#10;there in the ground, and expected that each was to come up a&#10;perfect tree, from which he might shake down potatoes. And they&#10;certainly grew, and produced flowers and green watery fruit, but it&#10;all withered away. Nobody thought of what was in the ground&#8212;the&#10;blessing&#8212;the potato. Yes, we have endured and suffered, that is to&#10;say, our forefathers have; they and we, it is all one.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;What a story it was!&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Well, and that will do,&#34; said the woman. &#34;Now look at the&#10;sloe bush.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;We have also some near relations in the home of the&#10;potatoes, but higher towards the north than they grew,&#34; said the&#10;Sloes. &#34;There were Northmen, from Norway, who steered westward&#10;through mist and storm to an unknown land, where, behind ice and&#10;snow, they found plants and green meadows, and bushes with&#10;blue-black grapes&#8212;sloe bushes. The grapes were ripened by the frost&#10;just as we are. And they called the land &#39;wine-land,&#39; that is,&#10;&#39;Groenland,&#39; or &#39;Sloeland.&#39;&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;That is quite a romantic story,&#34; said the young&#10;man.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, certainly. But now come with me,&#34; said the wise&#10;woman, and she led him to the bee-hive.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;He looked into it. What life and labor! There were bees&#10;standing in all the passages, waving their wings, so that a&#10;wholesome draught of air might blow through the great manufactory;&#10;that was their business. Then there came in bees from without, who&#10;had been born with little baskets on their feet; they brought&#10;flower-dust, which was poured out, sorted, and manufactured into&#10;honey and wax. They flew in and out. The queen-bee wanted to fly&#10;out, but then all the other bees must have gone with her. It was&#10;not yet the time for that, but still she wanted to fly out; so the&#10;others bit off her majesty&#39;s wings, and she had to stay where she&#10;was.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Now get upon the earth bank,&#34; said the wise woman. &#34;Come&#10;and look out over the highway, where you can see the&#10;people.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What a crowd it is!&#34; said the young man. &#34;One story after&#10;another. It whirls and whirls! It&#39;s quite a confusion before my&#10;eyes. I shall go out at the back.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No, go straight forward,&#34; said the woman. &#34;Go straight&#10;into the crowd of people; look at them in the right way. Have an&#10;ear to hear and the right heart to feel, and you will soon invent&#10;something. But, before you go away, you must give me my spectacles&#10;and my ear-trumpet again.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And so saying, she took both from him.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Now I do not see the smallest thing,&#34; said the young man,&#10;&#34;and now I don&#39;t hear anything more.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Why, then, you can&#39;t be a poet by Easter,&#34; said the wise&#10;woman.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But, by what time can I be one?&#34; asked he.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Neither by Easter nor by Whitsuntide! You will not learn&#10;how to invent anything.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What must I do to earn my bread by poetry?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You can do that before Shrove Tuesday. Hunt the poets!&#10;Kill their writings and thus you will kill them. Don&#39;t be put out&#10;of countenance. Strike at them boldly, and you&#39;ll have carnival&#10;cake, on which you can support yourself and your wife&#10;too.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What one can invent!&#34; cried the young man. And so he hit&#10;out boldly at every second poet, because he could not be a poet&#10;himself.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;We have it from the wise woman.

Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Wicked Prince'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;THERE lived once upon a time a wicked prince whose heart&#10;and mind were set upon conquering all the countries of the world,&#10;and on frightening the people; he devastated their countries with&#10;fire and sword, and his soldiers trod down the crops in the fields&#10;and destroyed the peasants&#39; huts by fire, so that the flames licked&#10;the green leaves off the branches, and the fruit hung dried up on&#10;the singed black trees. Many a poor mother fled, her naked baby in&#10;her arms, behind the still smoking walls of her cottage; but also&#10;there the soldiers followed her, and when they found her, she&#10;served as new nourishment to their diabolical enjoyments; demons&#10;could not possibly have done worse things than these soldiers! The&#10;prince was of opinion that all this was right, and that it was only&#10;the natural course which things ought to take. His power increased&#10;day by day, his name was feared by all, and fortune favoured his&#10;deeds.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;He brought enormous wealth home from the conquered towns,&#10;and gradually accumulated in his residence riches which could&#10;nowhere be equalled. He erected magnificent palaces, churches, and&#10;halls, and all who saw these splendid buildings and great treasures&#10;exclaimed admiringly: &#34;What a mighty prince!&#34; But they did not know&#10;what endless misery he had brought upon other countries, nor did&#10;they hear the sighs and lamentations which rose up from the debris&#10;of the destroyed cities.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The prince often looked with delight upon his gold and his&#10;magnificent edifices, and thought, like the crowd: &#34;What a mighty&#10;prince! But I must have more&#8212;much more. No power on earth must&#10;equal mine, far less exceed it.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;He made war with all his neighbours, and defeated them.&#10;The conquered kings were chained up with golden fetters to his&#10;chariot when he drove through the streets of his city. These kings&#10;had to kneel at his and his courtiers&#39; feet when they sat at table,&#10;and live on the morsels which they left. At last the prince had his&#10;own statue erected on the public places and fixed on the royal&#10;palaces; nay, he even wished it to be placed in the churches, on&#10;the altars, but in this the priests opposed him, saying: &#34;Prince,&#10;you are mighty indeed, but God&#39;s power is much greater than yours;&#10;we dare not obey your orders.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Well,&#34; said the prince. &#34;Then I will conquer God too.&#34;&#10;And in his haughtiness and foolish presumption he ordered a&#10;magnificent ship to be constructed, with which he could sail&#10;through the air; it was gorgeously fitted out and of many colours;&#10;like the tail of a peacock, it was covered with thousands of eyes,&#10;but each eye was the barrel of a gun. The prince sat in the centre&#10;of the ship, and had only to touch a spring in order to make&#10;thousands of bullets fly out in all directions, while the guns were&#10;at once loaded again. Hundreds of eagles were attached to this&#10;ship, and it rose with the swiftness of an arrow up towards the&#10;sun. The earth was soon left far below, and looked, with its&#10;mountains and woods, like a cornfield where the plough had made&#10;furrows which separated green meadows; soon it looked only like a&#10;map with indistinct lines upon it; and at last it entirely&#10;disappeared in mist and clouds. Higher and higher rose the eagles&#10;up into the air; then God sent one of his numberless angels against&#10;the ship. The wicked prince showered thousands of bullets upon him,&#10;but they rebounded from his shining wings and fell down like&#10;ordinary hailstones. One drop of blood, one single drop, came out&#10;of the white feathers of the angel&#39;s wings and fell upon the ship&#10;in which the prince sat, burnt into it, and weighed upon it like&#10;thousands of hundredweights, dragging it rapidly down to the earth&#10;again; the strong wings of the eagles gave way, the wind roared&#10;round the prince&#39;s head, and the clouds around&#8212;were they formed by&#10;the smoke rising up from the burnt cities?&#8212;took strange shapes,&#10;like crabs many, many miles long, which stretched their claws out&#10;after him, and rose up like enormous rocks, from which rolling&#10;masses dashed down, and became fire-spitting dragons.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The prince was lying half-dead in his ship, when it sank&#10;at last with a terrible shock into the branches of a large tree in&#10;the wood.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I will conquer God!&#34; said the prince. &#34;I have sworn it:&#10;my will must be done!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And he spent seven years in the construction of wonderful&#10;ships to sail through the air, and had darts cast from the hardest&#10;steel to break the walls of heaven with. He gathered warriors from&#10;all countries, so many that when they were placed side by side they&#10;covered the space of several miles. They entered the ships and the&#10;prince was approaching his own, when God sent a swarm of gnats&#8212;one&#10;swarm of little gnats. They buzzed round the prince and stung his&#10;face and hands; angrily he drew his sword and brandished it, but he&#10;only touched the air and did not hit the gnats. Then he ordered his&#10;servants to bring costly coverings and wrap him in them, that the&#10;gnats might no longer be able to reach him. The servants carried&#10;out his orders, but one single gnat had placed itself inside one of&#10;the coverings, crept into the prince&#39;s ear and stung him. The place&#10;burnt like fire, and the poison entered into his blood. Mad with&#10;pain, he tore off the coverings and his clothes too, flinging them&#10;far away, and danced about before the eyes of his ferocious&#10;soldiers, who now mocked at him, the mad prince, who wished to make&#10;war with God, and was overcome by a single little gnat.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Wild Swans'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;FAR away in the land to which the swallows fly when it is&#10;winter, dwelt a king who had eleven sons, and one daughter, named&#10;Eliza. The eleven brothers were princes, and each went to school&#10;with a star on his breast, and a sword by his side. They wrote with&#10;diamond pencils on gold slates, and learnt their lessons so quickly&#10;and read so easily that every one might know they were princes.&#10;Their sister Eliza sat on a little stool of plate-glass, and had a&#10;book full of pictures, which had cost as much as half a kingdom.&#10;Oh, these children were indeed happy, but it was not to remain so&#10;always. Their father, who was king of the country, married a very&#10;wicked queen, who did not love the poor children at all. They knew&#10;this from the very first day after the wedding. In the palace there&#10;were great festivities, and the children played at receiving&#10;company; but instead of having, as usual, all the cakes and apples&#10;that were left, she gave them some sand in a tea-cup, and told them&#10;to pretend it was cake. The week after, she sent little Eliza into&#10;the country to a peasant and his wife, and then she told the king&#10;so many untrue things about the young princes, that he gave himself&#10;no more trouble respecting them.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Go out into the world and get your own living,&#34; said the&#10;queen. &#34;Fly like great birds, who have no voice.&#34; But she could not&#10;make them ugly as she wished, for they were turned into eleven&#10;beautiful wild swans. Then, with a strange cry, they flew through&#10;the windows of the palace, over the park, to the forest beyond. It&#10;was early morning when they passed the peasant&#39;s cottage, where&#10;their sister Eliza lay asleep in her room. They hovered over the&#10;roof, twisted their long necks and flapped their wings, but no one&#10;heard them or saw them, so they were at last obliged to fly away,&#10;high up in the clouds; and over the wide world they flew till they&#10;came to a thick, dark wood, which stretched far away to the&#10;seashore. Poor little Eliza was alone in her room playing with a&#10;green leaf, for she had no other playthings, and she pierced a hole&#10;through the leaf, and looked through it at the sun, and it was as&#10;if she saw her brothers&#39; clear eyes, and when the warm sun shone on&#10;her cheeks, she thought of all the kisses they had given her. One&#10;day passed just like another; sometimes the winds rustled through&#10;the leaves of the rose-bush, and would whisper to the roses, &#34;Who&#10;can be more beautiful than you!&#34; But the roses would shake their&#10;heads, and say, &#34;Eliza is.&#34; And when the old woman sat at the&#10;cottage door on Sunday, and read her hymn-book, the wind would&#10;flutter the leaves, and say to the book, &#34;Who can be more pious&#10;than you?&#34; and then the hymn-book would answer &#34;Eliza.&#34; And the&#10;roses and the hymn-book told the real truth. At fifteen she&#10;returned home, but when the queen saw how beautiful she was, she&#10;became full of spite and hatred towards her. Willingly would she&#10;have turned her into a swan, like her brothers, but she did not&#10;dare to do so yet, because the king wished to see his daughter.&#10;Early one morning the queen went into the bath-room; it was built&#10;of marble, and had soft cushions, trimmed with the most beautiful&#10;tapestry. She took three toads with her, and kissed them, and said&#10;to one, &#34;When Eliza comes to the bath, seat yourself upon her head,&#10;that she may become as stupid as you are.&#34; Then she said to&#10;another, &#34;Place yourself on her forehead, that she may become as&#10;ugly as you are, and that her father may not know her.&#34; &#34;Rest on&#10;her heart,&#34; she whispered to the third, &#34;then she will have evil&#10;inclinations, and suffer in consequence.&#34; So she put the toads into&#10;the clear water, and they turned green immediately. She next called&#10;Eliza, and helped her to undress and get into the bath. As Eliza&#10;dipped her head under the water, one of the toads sat on her hair,&#10;a second on her forehead, and a third on her breast, but she did&#10;not seem to notice them, and when she rose out of the water, there&#10;were three red poppies floating upon it. Had not the creatures been&#10;venomous or been kissed by the witch, they would have been changed&#10;into red roses. At all events they became flowers, because they had&#10;rested on Eliza&#39;s head, and on her heart. She was too good and too&#10;innocent for witchcraft to have any power over her. When the wicked&#10;queen saw this, she rubbed her face with walnut-juice, so that she&#10;was quite brown; then she tangled her beautiful hair and smeared it&#10;with disgusting ointment, till it was quite impossible to recognize&#10;the beautiful Eliza.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;When her father saw her, he was much shocked, and declared&#10;she was not his daughter. No one but the watch-dog and the swallows&#10;knew her; and they were only poor animals, and could say nothing.&#10;Then poor Eliza wept, and thought of her eleven brothers, who were&#10;all away. Sorrowfully, she stole away from the palace, and walked,&#10;the whole day, over fields and moors, till she came to the great&#10;forest. She knew not in what direction to go; but she was so&#10;unhappy, and longed so for her brothers, who had been, like&#10;herself, driven out into the world, that she was determined to seek&#10;them. She had been but a short time in the wood when night came on,&#10;and she quite lost the path; so she laid herself down on the soft&#10;moss, offered up her evening prayer, and leaned her head against&#10;the stump of a tree. All nature was still, and the soft, mild air&#10;fanned her forehead. The light of hundreds of glow-worms shone&#10;amidst the grass and the moss, like green fire; and if she touched&#10;a twig with her hand, ever so lightly, the brilliant insects fell&#10;down around her, like shooting-stars.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;All night long she dreamt of her brothers. She and they&#10;were children again, playing together. She saw them writing with&#10;their diamond pencils on golden slates, while she looked at the&#10;beautiful picture-book which had cost half a kingdom. They were not&#10;writing lines and letters, as they used to do; but descriptions of&#10;the noble deeds they had performed, and of all they had discovered&#10;and seen. In the picture-book, too, everything was living. The&#10;birds sang, and the people came out of the book, and spoke to Eliza&#10;and her brothers; but, as the leaves turned over, they darted back&#10;again to their places, that all might be in order.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;When she awoke, the sun was high in the heavens; yet she&#10;could not see him, for the lofty trees spread their branches&#10;thickly over her head; but his beams were glancing through the&#10;leaves here and there, like a golden mist. There was a sweet&#10;fragrance from the fresh green verdure, and the birds almost&#10;perched upon her shoulders. She heard water rippling from a number&#10;of springs, all flowing in a lake with golden sands. Bushes grew&#10;thickly round the lake, and at one spot an opening had been made by&#10;a deer, through which Eliza went down to the water. The lake was so&#10;clear that, had not the wind rustled the branches of the trees and&#10;the bushes, so that they moved, they would have appeared as if&#10;painted in the depths of the lake; for every leaf was reflected in&#10;the water, whether it stood in the shade or the sunshine. As soon&#10;as Eliza saw her own face, she was quite terrified at finding it so&#10;brown and ugly; but when she wetted her little hand, and rubbed her&#10;eyes and forehead, the white skin gleamed forth once more; and,&#10;after she had undressed, and dipped herself in the fresh water, a&#10;more beautiful king&#39;s daughter could not be found in the wide&#10;world. As soon as she had dressed herself again, and braided her&#10;long hair, she went to the bubbling spring, and drank some water&#10;out of the hollow of her hand. Then she wandered far into the&#10;forest, not knowing whither she went. She thought of her brothers,&#10;and felt sure that God would not forsake her. It is God who makes&#10;the wild apples grow in the wood, to satisfy the hungry, and He now&#10;led her to one of these trees, which was so loaded with fruit, that&#10;the boughs bent beneath the weight. Here she held her noonday&#10;repast, placed props under the boughs, and then went into the&#10;gloomiest depths of the forest. It was so still that she could hear&#10;the sound of her own footsteps, as well as the rustling of every&#10;withered leaf which she crushed under her feet. Not a bird was to&#10;be seen, not a sunbeam could penetrate through the large, dark&#10;boughs of the trees. Their lofty trunks stood so close together,&#10;that, when she looked before her, it seemed as if she were enclosed&#10;within trellis-work. Such solitude she had never known before. The&#10;night was very dark. Not a single glow-worm glittered in the&#10;moss.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Sorrowfully she laid herself down to sleep; and, after a&#10;while, it seemed to her as if the branches of the trees parted over&#10;her head, and that the mild eyes of angels looked down upon her&#10;from heaven. When she awoke in the morning, she knew not whether&#10;she had dreamt this, or if it had really been so. Then she&#10;continued her wandering; but she had not gone many steps forward,&#10;when she met an old woman with berries in her basket, and she gave&#10;her a few to eat. Then Eliza asked her if she had not seen eleven&#10;princes riding through the forest.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;No,&#34; replied the old woman, &#34;But I saw yesterday eleven&#10;swans, with gold crowns on their heads, swimming on the river close&#10;by.&#34; Then she led Eliza a little distance farther to a sloping&#10;bank, and at the foot of it wound a little river. The trees on its&#10;banks stretched their long leafy branches across the water towards&#10;each other, and where the growth prevented them from meeting&#10;naturally, the roots had torn themselves away from the ground, so&#10;that the branches might mingle their foliage as they hung over the&#10;water. Eliza bade the old woman farewell, and walked by the flowing&#10;river, till she reached the shore of the open sea. And there,&#10;before the young maiden&#39;s eyes, lay the glorious ocean, but not a&#10;sail appeared on its surface, not even a boat could be seen. How&#10;was she to go farther? She noticed how the countless pebbles on the&#10;sea-shore had been smoothed and rounded by the action of the water.&#10;Glass, iron, stones, everything that lay there mingled together,&#10;had taken its shape from the same power, and felt as smooth, or&#10;even smoother than her own delicate hand. &#34;The water rolls on&#10;without weariness,&#34; she said, till all that is hard becomes smooth;&#10;so will I be unwearied in my task. Thanks for your lessons, bright&#10;rolling waves; my heart tells me you will lead me to my dear&#10;brothers.&#34; On the foam-covered sea-weeds, lay eleven white swan&#10;feathers, which she gathered up and placed together. Drops of water&#10;lay upon them; whether they were dew-drops or tears no one could&#10;say. Lonely as it was on the sea-shore, she did not observe it, for&#10;the ever-moving sea showed more changes in a few hours than the&#10;most varying lake could produce during a whole year. If a black&#10;heavy cloud arose, it was as if the sea said, &#34;I can look dark and&#10;angry too;&#34; and then the wind blew, and the waves turned to white&#10;foam as they rolled. When the wind slept, and the clouds glowed&#10;with the red sunlight, then the sea looked like a rose leaf. But&#10;however quietly its white glassy surface rested, there was still a&#10;motion on the shore, as its waves rose and fell like the breast of&#10;a sleeping child. When the sun was about to set, Eliza saw eleven&#10;white swans with golden crowns on their heads, flying towards the&#10;land, one behind the other, like a long white ribbon. Then Eliza&#10;went down the slope from the shore, and hid herself behind the&#10;bushes. The swans alighted quite close to her and flapped their&#10;great white wings. As soon as the sun had disappeared under the&#10;water, the feathers of the swans fell off, and eleven beautiful&#10;princes, Eliza&#39;s brothers, stood near her. She uttered a loud cry,&#10;for, although they were very much changed, she knew them&#10;immediately. She sprang into their arms, and called them each by&#10;name. Then, how happy the princes were at meeting their little&#10;sister again, for they recognized her, although she had grown so&#10;tall and beautiful. They laughed, and they wept, and very soon&#10;understood how wickedly their mother had acted to them all. &#34;We&#10;brothers,&#34; said the eldest, &#34;fly about as wild swans, so long as&#10;the sun is in the sky; but as soon as it sinks behind the hills, we&#10;recover our human shape. Therefore must we always be near a resting&#10;place for our feet before sunset; for if we should be flying&#10;towards the clouds at the time we recovered our natural shape as&#10;men, we should sink deep into the sea. We do not dwell here, but in&#10;a land just as fair, that lies beyond the ocean, which we have to&#10;cross for a long distance; there is no island in our passage upon&#10;which we could pass, the night; nothing but a little rock rising&#10;out of the sea, upon which we can scarcely stand with safety, even&#10;closely crowded together. If the sea is rough, the foam dashes over&#10;us, yet we thank God even for this rock; we have passed whole&#10;nights upon it, or we should never have reached our beloved&#10;fatherland, for our flight across the sea occupies two of the&#10;longest days in the year. We have permission to visit out home once&#10;in every year, and to remain eleven days, during which we fly&#10;across the forest to look once more at the palace where our father&#10;dwells, and where we were born, and at the church, where our mother&#10;lies buried. Here it seems as if the very trees and bushes were&#10;related to us. The wild horses leap over the plains as we have seen&#10;them in our childhood. The charcoal burners sing the old songs, to&#10;which we have danced as children. This is our fatherland, to which&#10;we are drawn by loving ties; and here we have found you, our dear&#10;little sister., Two days longer we can remain here, and then must&#10;we fly away to a beautiful land which is not our home; and how can&#10;we take you with us? We have neither ship nor boat.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;How can I break this spell?&#34; said their sister. And then&#10;she talked about it nearly the whole night, only slumbering for a&#10;few hours. Eliza was awakened by the rustling of the swans&#39; wings&#10;as they soared above. Her brothers were again changed to swans, and&#10;they flew in circles wider and wider, till they were far away; but&#10;one of them, the youngest swan, remained behind, and laid his head&#10;in his sister&#39;s lap, while she stroked his wings; and they remained&#10;together the whole day. Towards evening, the rest came back, and as&#10;the sun went down they resumed their natural forms. &#34;To-morrow,&#34;&#10;said one, &#34;we shall fly away, not to return again till a whole year&#10;has passed. But we cannot leave you here. Have you courage to go&#10;with us? My arm is strong enough to carry you through the wood; and&#10;will not all our wings be strong enough to fly with you over the&#10;sea?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, take me with you,&#34; said Eliza. Then they spent the&#10;whole night in weaving a net with the pliant willow and rushes. It&#10;was very large and strong. Eliza laid herself down on the net, and&#10;when the sun rose, and her brothers again became wild swans, they&#10;took up the net with their beaks, and flew up to the clouds with&#10;their dear sister, who still slept. The sunbeams fell on her face,&#10;therefore one of the swans soared over her head, so that his broad&#10;wings might shade her. They were far from the land when Eliza woke.&#10;She thought she must still be dreaming, it seemed so strange to her&#10;to feel herself being carried so high in the air over the sea. By&#10;her side lay a branch full of beautiful ripe berries, and a bundle&#10;of sweet roots; the youngest of her brothers had gathered them for&#10;her, and placed them by her side. She smiled her thanks to him; she&#10;knew it was the same who had hovered over her to shade her with his&#10;wings. They were now so high, that a large ship beneath them looked&#10;like a white sea-gull skimming the waves. A great cloud floating&#10;behind them appeared like a vast mountain, and upon it Eliza saw&#10;her own shadow and those of the eleven swans, looking gigantic in&#10;size. Altogether it formed a more beautiful picture than she had&#10;ever seen; but as the sun rose higher, and the clouds were left&#10;behind, the shadowy picture vanished away. Onward the whole day&#10;they flew through the air like a winged arrow, yet more slowly than&#10;usual, for they had their sister to carry. The weather seemed&#10;inclined to be stormy, and Eliza watched the sinking sun with great&#10;anxiety, for the little rock in the ocean was not yet in sight. It&#10;appeared to her as if the swans were making great efforts with&#10;their wings. Alas! she was the cause of their not advancing more&#10;quickly. When the sun set, they would change to men, fall into the&#10;sea and be drowned. Then she offered a prayer from her inmost&#10;heart, but still no appearance of the rock. Dark clouds came&#10;nearer, the gusts of wind told of a coming storm, while from a&#10;thick, heavy mass of clouds the lightning burst forth flash after&#10;flash. The sun had reached the edge of the sea, when the swans&#10;darted down so swiftly, that Eliza&#39;s head trembled; she believed&#10;they were falling, but they again soared onward. Presently she&#10;caught sight of the rock just below them, and by this time the sun&#10;was half hidden by the waves. The rock did not appear larger than a&#10;seal&#39;s head thrust out of the water. They sunk so rapidly, that at&#10;the moment their feet touched the rock, it shone only like a star,&#10;and at last disappeared like the last spark in a piece of burnt&#10;paper. Then she saw her brothers standing closely round her with&#10;their arms linked together. There was but just room enough for&#10;them, and not the smallest space to spare. The sea dashed against&#10;the rock, and covered them with spray. The heavens were lighted up&#10;with continual flashes, and peal after peal of thunder rolled. But&#10;the sister and brothers sat holding each other&#39;s hands, and singing&#10;hymns, from which they gained hope and courage. In the early dawn&#10;the air became calm and still, and at sunrise the swans flew away&#10;from the rock with Eliza. The sea was still rough, and from their&#10;high position in the air, the white foam on the dark green waves&#10;looked like millions of swans swimming on the water. As the sun&#10;rose higher, Eliza saw before her, floating on the air, a range of&#10;mountains, with shining masses of ice on their summits. In the&#10;centre, rose a castle apparently a mile long, with rows of columns,&#10;rising one above another, while, around it, palm-trees waved and&#10;flowers bloomed as large as mill wheels. She asked if this was the&#10;land to which they were hastening. The swans shook their heads, for&#10;what she beheld were the beautiful ever-changing cloud palaces of&#10;the &#34;Fata Morgana,&#34; into which no mortal can enter. Eliza was still&#10;gazing at the scene, when mountains, forests, and castles melted&#10;away, and twenty stately churches rose in their stead, with high&#10;towers and pointed gothic windows. Eliza even fancied she could&#10;hear the tones of the organ, but it was the music of the murmuring&#10;sea which she heard. As they drew nearer to the churches, they also&#10;changed into a fleet of ships, which seemed to be sailing beneath&#10;her; but as she looked again, she found it was only a sea mist&#10;gliding over the ocean. So there continued to pass before her eyes&#10;a constant change of scene, till at last she saw the real land to&#10;which they were bound, with its blue mountains, its cedar forests,&#10;and its cities and palaces. Long before the sun went down, she sat&#10;on a rock, in front of a large cave, on the floor of which the&#10;over-grown yet delicate green creeping plants looked like an&#10;embroidered carpet. &#34;Now we shall expect to hear what you dream of&#10;to-night,&#34; said the youngest brother, as he showed his sister her&#10;bedroom.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Heaven grant that I may dream how to save you,&#34; she&#10;replied. And this thought took such hold upon her mind that she&#10;prayed earnestly to God for help, and even in her sleep she&#10;continued to pray. Then it appeared to her as if she were flying&#10;high in the air, towards the cloudy palace of the &#34;Fata Morgana,&#34;&#10;and a fairy came out to meet her, radiant and beautiful in&#10;appearance, and yet very much like the old woman who had given her&#10;berries in the wood, and who had told her of the swans with golden&#10;crowns on their heads. &#34;Your brothers can be released,&#34; said she,&#10;&#34;if you have only courage and perseverance. True, water is softer&#10;than your own delicate hands, and yet it polishes stones into&#10;shapes; it feels no pain as your fingers would feel, it has no&#10;soul, and cannot suffer such agony and torment as you will have to&#10;endure. Do you see the stinging nettle which I hold in my hand?&#10;Quantities of the same sort grow round the cave in which you sleep,&#10;but none will be of any use to you unless they grow upon the graves&#10;in a churchyard. These you must gather even while they burn&#10;blisters on your hands. Break them to pieces with your hands and&#10;feet, and they will become flax, from which you must spin and weave&#10;eleven coats with long sleeves; if these are then thrown over the&#10;eleven swans, the spell will be broken. But remember, that from the&#10;moment you commence your task until it is finished, even should it&#10;occupy years of your life, you must not speak. The first word you&#10;utter will pierce through the hearts of your brothers like a deadly&#10;dagger. Their lives hang upon your tongue. Remember all I have told&#10;you.&#34; And as she finished speaking, she touched her hand lightly&#10;with the nettle, and a pain, as of burning fire, awoke&#10;Eliza.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was broad daylight, and close by where she had been&#10;sleeping lay a nettle like the one she had seen in her dream. She&#10;fell on her knees and offered her thanks to God. Then she went&#10;forth from the cave to begin her work with her delicate hands. She&#10;groped in amongst the ugly nettles, which burnt great blisters on&#10;her hands and arms, but she determined to bear it gladly if she&#10;could only release her dear brothers. So she bruised the nettles&#10;with her bare feet and spun the flax. At sunset her brothers&#10;returned and were very much frightened when they found her dumb.&#10;They believed it to be some new sorcery of their wicked&#10;step-mother. But when they saw her hands they understood what she&#10;was doing on their behalf, and the youngest brother wept, and where&#10;his tears fell the pain ceased, and the burning blisters vanished.&#10;She kept to her work all night, for she could not rest till she had&#10;released her dear brothers. During the whole of the following day,&#10;while her brothers were absent, she sat in solitude, but never&#10;before had the time flown so quickly. One coat was already finished&#10;and she had begun the second, when she heard the huntsman&#39;s horn,&#10;and was struck with fear. The sound came nearer and nearer, she&#10;heard the dogs barking, and fled with terror into the cave. She&#10;hastily bound together the nettles she had gathered into a bundle&#10;and sat upon them. Immediately a great dog came bounding towards&#10;her out of the ravine, and then another and another; they barked&#10;loudly, ran back, and then came again. In a very few minutes all&#10;the huntsmen stood before the cave, and the handsomest of them was&#10;the king of the country. He advanced towards her, for he had never&#10;seen a more beautiful maiden.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;How did you come here, my sweet child?&#34; he asked. But&#10;Eliza shook her head. She dared not speak, at the cost of her&#10;brothers&#39; lives. And she hid her hands under her apron, so that the&#10;king might not see how she must be suffering.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Come with me,&#34; he said; &#34;here you cannot remain. If you&#10;are as good as you are beautiful, I will dress you in silk and&#10;velvet, I will place a golden crown upon your head, and you shall&#10;dwell, and rule, and make your home in my richest castle.&#34; And then&#10;he lifted her on his horse. She wept and wrung her hands, but the&#10;king said, &#34;I wish only for your happiness. A time will come when&#10;you will thank me for this.&#34; And then he galloped away over the&#10;mountains, holding her before him on this horse, and the hunters&#10;followed behind them. As the sun went down, they approached a fair&#10;royal city, with churches, and cupolas. On arriving at the castle&#10;the king led her into marble halls, where large fountains played,&#10;and where the walls and the ceilings were covered with rich&#10;paintings. But she had no eyes for all these glorious sights, she&#10;could only mourn and weep. Patiently she allowed the women to array&#10;her in royal robes, to weave pearls in her hair, and draw soft&#10;gloves over her blistered fingers. As she stood before them in all&#10;her rich dress, she looked so dazzingly beautiful that the court&#10;bowed low in her presence. Then the king declared his intention of&#10;making her his bride, but the archbishop shook his head, and&#10;whispered that the fair young maiden was only a witch who had&#10;blinded the king&#39;s eyes and bewitched his heart. But the king would&#10;not listen to this; he ordered the music to sound, the daintiest&#10;dishes to be served, and the loveliest maidens to dance.&#10;After-wards he led her through fragrant gardens and lofty halls,&#10;but not a smile appeared on her lips or sparkled in her eyes. She&#10;looked the very picture of grief. Then the king opened the door of&#10;a little chamber in which she. was to sleep; it was adorned with&#10;rich green tapestry, and resembled the cave in which he had found&#10;her. On the floor lay the bundle of flax which she had spun from&#10;the nettles, and under the ceiling hung the coat she had made.&#10;These things had been brought away from the cave as curiosities by&#10;one of the huntsmen.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Here you can dream yourself back again in the old home in&#10;the cave,&#34; said the king; &#34;here is the work with which you employed&#10;yourself. It will amuse you now in the midst of all this splendor&#10;to think of that time.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;When Eliza saw all these things which lay so near her&#10;heart, a smile played around her mouth, and the crimson blood&#10;rushed to her cheeks. She thought of her brothers, and their&#10;release made her so joyful that she kissed the king&#39;s hand. Then he&#10;pressed her to his heart. Very soon the joyous church bells&#10;announced the marriage feast, and that the beautiful dumb girl out&#10;of the wood was to be made the queen of the country. Then the&#10;archbishop whispered wicked words in the king&#39;s ear, but they did&#10;not sink into his heart. The marriage was still to take place, and&#10;the archbishop himself had to place the crown on the bride&#39;s head;&#10;in his wicked spite, he pressed the narrow circlet so tightly on&#10;her forehead that it caused her pain. But a heavier weight&#10;encircled her heart&#8212;sorrow for her brothers. She felt not bodily&#10;pain. Her mouth was closed; a single word would cost the lives of&#10;her brothers. But she loved the kind, handsome king, who did&#10;everything to make her happy more and more each day; she loved him&#10;with all her heart, and her eyes beamed with the love she dared not&#10;speak. Oh! if she had only been able to confide in him and tell him&#10;of her grief. But dumb she must remain till her task was finished.&#10;Therefore at night she crept away into her little chamber, which&#10;had been decked out to look like the cave, and quickly wove one&#10;coat after another. But when she began the seventh she found she&#10;had no more flax. She knew that the nettles she wanted to use grew&#10;in the churchyard, and that she must pluck them herself. How should&#10;she get out there? &#34;Oh, what is the pain in my fingers to the&#10;torment which my heart endures?&#34; said she. &#34;I must venture, I shall&#10;not be denied help from heaven.&#34; Then with a trembling heart, as if&#10;she were about to perform a wicked deed, she crept into the garden&#10;in the broad moonlight, and passed through the narrow walks and the&#10;deserted streets, till she reached the churchyard. Then she saw on&#10;one of the broad tombstones a group of ghouls. These hideous&#10;creatures took off their rags, as if they intended to bathe, and&#10;then clawing open the fresh graves with their long, skinny fingers,&#10;pulled out the dead bodies and ate the flesh! Eliza had to pass&#10;close by them, and they fixed their wicked glances upon her, but&#10;she prayed silently, gathered the burning nettles, and carried them&#10;home with her to the castle. One person only had seen her, and that&#10;was the archbishop&#8212;he was awake while everybody was asleep. Now he&#10;thought his opinion was evidently correct. All was not right with&#10;the queen. She was a witch, and had bewitched the king and all the&#10;people. Secretly he told the king what he had seen and what he&#10;feared, and as the hard words came from his tongue, the carved&#10;images of the saints shook their heads as if they would say. &#34;It is&#10;not so. Eliza is innocent.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But the archbishop interpreted it in another way; he&#10;believed that they witnessed against her, and were shaking their&#10;heads at her wickedness. Two large tears rolled down the king&#39;s&#10;cheeks, and he went home with doubt in his heart, and at night he&#10;pretended to sleep, but there came no real sleep to his eyes, for&#10;he saw Eliza get up every night and disappear in her own chamber.&#10;From day to day his brow became darker, and Eliza saw it and did&#10;not understand the reason, but it alarmed her and made her heart&#10;tremble for her brothers. Her hot tears glittered like pearls on&#10;the regal velvet and diamonds, while all who saw her were wishing&#10;they could be queens. In the mean time she had almost finished her&#10;task; only one coat of mail was wanting, but she had no flax left,&#10;and not a single nettle. Once more only, and for the last time,&#10;must she venture to the churchyard and pluck a few handfuls. She&#10;thought with terror of the solitary walk, and of the horrible&#10;ghouls, but her will was firm, as well as her trust in Providence.&#10;Eliza went, and the king and the archbishop followed her. They saw&#10;her vanish through the wicket gate into the churchyard, and when&#10;they came nearer they saw the ghouls sitting on the tombstone, as&#10;Eliza had seen them, and the king turned away his head, for he&#10;thought she was with them&#8212;she whose head had rested on his breast&#10;that very evening. &#34;The people must condemn her,&#34; said he, and she&#10;was very quickly condemned by every one to suffer death by fire.&#10;Away from the gorgeous regal halls was she led to a dark, dreary&#10;cell, where the wind whistled through the iron bars. Instead of the&#10;velvet and silk dresses, they gave her the coats of mail which she&#10;had woven to cover her, and the bundle of nettles for a pillow; but&#10;nothing they could give her would have pleased her more. She&#10;continued her task with joy, and prayed for help, while the&#10;street-boys sang jeering songs about her, and not a soul comforted&#10;her with a kind word. Towards evening, she heard at the grating the&#10;flutter of a swan&#39;s wing, it was her youngest brother&#8212;he had found&#10;his sister, and she sobbed for joy, although she knew that very&#10;likely this would be the last night she would have to live. But&#10;still she could hope, for her task was almost finished, and her&#10;brothers were come. Then the archbishop arrived, to be with her&#10;during her last hours, as he had promised the king. But she shook&#10;her head, and begged him, by looks and gestures, not to stay; for&#10;in this night she knew she must finish her task, otherwise all her&#10;pain and tears and sleepless nights would have been suffered in&#10;vain. The archbishop withdrew, uttering bitter words against her;&#10;but poor Eliza knew that she was innocent, and diligently continued&#10;her work.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The little mice ran about the floor, they dragged the&#10;nettles to her feet, to help as well as they could; and the thrush&#10;sat outside the grating of the window, and sang to her the whole&#10;night long, as sweetly as possible, to keep up her&#10;spirits.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was still twilight, and at least an hour before&#10;sunrise, when the eleven brothers stood at the castle gate, and&#10;demanded to be brought before the king. They were told it could not&#10;be, it was yet almost night, and as the king slept they dared not&#10;disturb him. They threatened, they entreated. Then the guard&#10;appeared, and even the king himself, inquiring what all the noise&#10;meant. At this moment the sun rose. The eleven brothers were seen&#10;no more, but eleven wild swans flew away over the&#10;castle.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And now all the people came streaming forth from the gates&#10;of the city, to see the witch burnt. An old horse drew the cart on&#10;which she sat. They had dressed her in a garment of coarse&#10;sackcloth. Her lovely hair hung loose on her shoulders, her cheeks&#10;were deadly pale, her lips moved silently, while her fingers still&#10;worked at the green flax. Even on the way to death, she would not&#10;give up her task. The ten coats of mail lay at her feet, she was&#10;working hard at the eleventh, while the mob jeered her and said,&#10;&#34;See the witch, how she mutters! She has no hymn-book in her hand.&#10;She sits there with her ugly sorcery. Let us tear it in a thousand&#10;pieces.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And then they pressed towards her, and would have&#10;destroyed the coats of mail, but at the same moment eleven wild&#10;swans flew over her, and alighted on the cart. Then they flapped&#10;their large wings, and the crowd drew on one side in&#10;alarm.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;It is a sign from heaven that she is innocent,&#34; whispered&#10;many of them; but they ventured not to say it aloud.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;As the executioner seized her by the hand, to lift her out&#10;of the cart, she hastily threw the eleven coats of mail over the&#10;swans, and they immediately became eleven handsome princes; but the&#10;youngest had a swan&#39;s wing, instead of an arm; for she had not been&#10;able to finish the last sleeve of the coat.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Now I may speak,&#34; she exclaimed. &#34;I am&#10;innocent.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the people, who saw what happened, bowed to her, as&#10;before a saint; but she sank lifeless in her brothers&#39; arms,&#10;overcome with suspense, anguish, and pain.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, she is innocent,&#34; said the eldest brother; and then&#10;he related all that had taken place; and while he spoke there rose&#10;in the air a fragrance as from millions of roses. Every piece of&#10;faggot in the pile had taken root, and threw out branches, and&#10;appeared a thick hedge, large and high, covered with roses; while&#10;above all bloomed a white and shining flower, that glittered like a&#10;star. This flower the king plucked, and placed in Eliza&#39;s bosom,&#10;when she awoke from her swoon, with peace and happiness in her&#10;heart. And all the church bells rang of themselves, and the birds&#10;came in great troops. And a marriage procession returned to the&#10;castle, such as no king had ever before seen.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)

The Story that used to visit him&#10;of its own accord no longer came and knocked at his door. And why&#10;did it come no longer? It is true enough that for days and years&#10;the man had not thought of it, had not expected it to come and&#10;knock; and if he had expected it, it would certainly not have come;&#10;for without there was war, and within was the care and sorrow that&#10;war brings with it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The stork and the swallows came back from their long&#10;journey, for they thought of no danger; and, behold, when they&#10;arrived, the nest was burnt, the habitations of men were burnt, the&#10;hedges were all in disorder, and everything seemed gone, and the&#10;enemy&#39;s horses were stamping in the old graves. Those were hard,&#10;gloomy times, but they came to an end.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And now they were past and gone&#8212;so people said; yet no&#10;Story came and knocked at the door, or gave any tidings of its&#10;presence.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I suppose it must be dead, or gone away with many other&#10;things,&#34; said the man.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But the story never dies. And more than a whole year went&#10;by, and he longed&#8212;oh, so very much!&#8212;for the Story.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I wonder if the Story will ever come back again and&#10;knock?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And he remembered it so well in all the various forms in&#10;which it had come to him, sometimes young and charming, like spring&#10;itself, sometimes as a beautiful maiden, with a wreath of thyme in&#10;her hair, and a beechen branch in her hand, and with eyes that&#10;gleamed like deep woodland lakes in the bright sunshine.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Sometimes it had come to him in the guise of a peddler,&#10;and had opened its box and let silver ribbon come fluttering out,&#10;with verses and inscriptions of old remembrances.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;But it was most charming of all when it came as an old&#10;grandmother, with silvery hair, and such large, sensible eyes. She&#10;knew so well how to tell about the oldest times, long before the&#10;princesses spun with the golden spindles, and the dragons lay&#10;outside the castles, guarding them. She told with such an air of&#10;truth, that black spots danced before the eyes of all who heard&#10;her, and the floor became black with human blood; terrible to see&#10;and to hear, and yet so entertaining, because such a long time had&#10;passed since it all happened.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Will it ever knock at my door again?&#34; said the man, and&#10;he gazed at the door, so that black spots came before his eyes and&#10;upon the floor; he did not know if it was blood, or mourning crape&#10;from the dark heavy days.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And as he sat thus, the thought came upon him whether the&#10;Story might not have hidden itself, like the princess in the old&#10;tale. And he would now go in search of it; if he found it, it would&#10;beam in new splendor, lovelier than ever.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Who knows? Perhaps it has hidden itself in the straw that&#10;balances on the margin of the well. Carefully, carefully! Perhaps&#10;it lies hidden in a certain flower&#8212;that flower in one of the great&#10;books on the book-shelf.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the man went and opened one of the newest books, to&#10;gain information on this point; but there was no flower to be&#10;found. There he read about Holger Danske; and the man read that the&#10;tale had been invented and put together by a monk in France, that&#10;it was a romance, &#34;translated into Danish and printed in that&#10;language;&#34; that Holger Danske had never really lived, and&#10;consequently could never come again, as we have sung, and have been&#10;so glad to believe. And William Tell was treated just like Holger&#10;Danske. These were all only myths&#8212;nothing on which we could depend;&#10;and yet it is all written in a very learned book.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Well, I shall believe what I believe!&#34; said the man.&#10;&#34;There grows no plantain where no foot has trod.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And he closed the book and put it back in its place, and&#10;went to the fresh flowers at the window. Perhaps the Story might&#10;have hidden itself in the red tulips, with the golden yellow edges,&#10;or in the fresh rose, or in the beaming camellia. The sunshine lay&#10;among the flowers, but no Story.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The flowers which had been here in the dark troublous time&#10;had been much more beautiful; but they had been cut off, one after&#10;another, to be woven into wreaths and placed in coffins, and the&#10;flag had waved over them! Perhaps the Story had been buried with&#10;the flowers; but then the flowers would have known of it, and the&#10;coffin would have heard it, and every little blade of grass that&#10;shot forth would have told of it. The Story never dies.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Perhaps it has been here once, and has knocked; but who&#10;had eyes or ears for it in those times? People looked darkly,&#10;gloomily, and almost angrily at the sunshine of spring, at the&#10;twittering birds, and all the cheerful green; the tongue could not&#10;even bear the old merry, popular songs, and they were laid in the&#10;coffin with so much that our heart held dear. The Story may have&#10;knocked without obtaining a hearing; there was none to bid it&#10;welcome, and so it may have gone away.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I will go forth and seek it. Out in the country! out in&#10;the wood! and on the open sea beach!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Out in the country lies an old manor house, with red&#10;walls, pointed gables, and a red flag that floats on the tower. The&#10;nightingale sings among the finely-fringed beech-leaves, looking at&#10;the blooming apple trees of the garden, and thinking that they bear&#10;roses. Here the bees are mightily busy in the summer-time, and&#10;hover round their queen with their humming song. The autumn has&#10;much to tell of the wild chase, of the leaves of the trees, and of&#10;the races of men that are passing away together. The wild swans&#10;sing at Christmas-time on the open water, while in the old hall the&#10;guests by the fireside gladly listen to songs and to old&#10;legends.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Down into the old part of the garden, where the great&#10;avenue of wild chestnut trees lures the wanderer to tread its&#10;shades, went the man who was in search of the Story; for here the&#10;wind had once murmured something to him of &#34;Waldemar Daa and his&#10;Daughters.&#34; The Dryad in the tree, who was the Story-mother&#10;herself, had here told him the &#34;Dream of the Old Oak Tree.&#34; Here,&#10;in the time of the ancestral mother, had stood clipped hedges, but&#10;now only ferns and stinging nettles grew there, hiding the&#10;scattered fragments of old sculptured figures; the moss is growing&#10;in their eyes, but they can see as well as ever, which was more&#10;than the man could do who was in search of the Story, for he could&#10;not find that. Where could it be?&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The crows flew past him by hundreds across the old trees,&#10;and screamed, &#34;Krah! da!&#8212;Krah! da!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And he went out of the garden and over the grass-plot of&#10;the yard, into the alder grove; there stood a little six-sided&#10;house, with a poultry-yard and a duck-yard. In the middle of the&#10;room sat the old woman who had the management of the whole, and who&#10;knew accurately about every egg that was laid, and about every&#10;chicken that could creep out of an egg. But she was not the Story&#10;of which the man was in search; that she could attest with a&#10;Christian certificate of baptism and of vaccination that lay in her&#10;drawer.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Without, not far from the house, is a hill covered with&#10;red-thorn and broom. Here lies an old grave-stone, which was&#10;brought here many years ago from the churchyard of the provincial&#10;town, a remembrance of one of the most honored councillors of the&#10;place; his wife and his five daughters, all with folded hands and&#10;stiff ruffs, stand round him. One could look at them so long, that&#10;it had an effect upon the thoughts, and these reacted upon the&#10;stones, as if they were telling of old times; at least it had been&#10;so with the man who was in search of the Story.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;As he came nearer, he noticed a living butterfly sitting&#10;on the forehead of the sculptured councillor. The butterfly flapped&#10;its wings, and flew a little bit farther, and then returned&#10;fatigued to sit upon the grave-stone, as if to point out what grew&#10;there. Four-leaved shamrocks grew there; there were seven specimens&#10;close to each other. When fortune comes, it comes in a heap. He&#10;plucked the shamrocks and put them in his pocket.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Fortune is as good as red gold, but a new charming story&#10;would be better still,&#34; thought the man; but he could not find it&#10;here.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the sun went down, round and large; the meadow was&#10;covered with vapor. The moor-woman was at her&#10;brewing.&#38;#160;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It was evening. He stood alone in his room, and looked out&#10;upon the sea, over the meadow, over moor and coast. The moon shone&#10;bright, a mist was over the meadow, making it look like a great&#10;lake; and, indeed, it was once so, as the legend tells&#8212;and in the&#10;moonlight the eye realizes these myths.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the man thought of what he had been reading in the&#10;town, that William Tell and Holger Danske never really lived, but&#10;yet live in popular story, like the lake yonder, a living evidence&#10;for such myths. Yes, Holger Danske will return again!&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;As he stood thus and thought, something beat quite&#10;strongly against the window. Was it a bird, a bat or an owl? Those&#10;are not let in, even when they knock. The window flew open of&#10;itself, and an old woman looked in at the man.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What&#39;s your pleasure?&#34; said he. &#34;Who are you? You&#39;re&#10;looking in at the first floor window. Are you standing on a&#10;ladder?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You have a four-leaved shamrock in your pocket,&#34; she&#10;replied. &#34;Indeed, you have seven, and one of them is a six-leaved&#10;one.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Who are you?&#34; asked the man again.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The Moor-woman,&#34; she replied. &#34;The Moor-woman who brews.&#10;I was at it. The bung was in the cask, but one of the little&#10;moor-imps pulled it out in his mischief, and flung it up into the&#10;yard, where it beat against the window; and now the beer&#39;s running&#10;out of the cask, and that won&#39;t do good to anybody.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Pray tell me some more!&#34; said the man.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, wait a little,&#34; answered the Moor-woman. &#34;I&#39;ve&#10;something else to do just now.&#34; And she was gone.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The man was going to shut the window, when the woman&#10;already stood before him again.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Now it&#39;s done,&#34; she said; &#34;but I shall have half the beer&#10;to brew over again to-morrow, if the weather is suitable. Well,&#10;what have you to ask me? I&#39;ve come back, for I always keep my word,&#10;and you have seven four-leaved shamrocks in your pocket, and one of&#10;them is a six-leaved one. That inspires respect, for that&#39;s an&#10;order that grows beside the sandy way; but that every one does not&#10;find. What have you to ask me? Don&#39;t stand there like a ridiculous&#10;oaf, for I must go back again directly to my bung and my&#10;cask.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the man asked about the Story, and inquired if the&#10;Moor-woman had met it in her journeyings.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;By the big brewing-vat!&#34; exclaimed the woman, &#34;haven&#39;t&#10;you got stories enough? I really believe that most people have&#10;enough of them. Here are other things to take notice of, other&#10;things to examine. Even the children have gone beyond that. Give&#10;the little boy a cigar, and the little girl a new crinoline; they&#10;like that much better. To listen to stories! No, indeed, there are&#10;more important things to be done here, and other things to&#10;notice!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What do you mean by that?&#34; asked the man, &#34;and what do&#10;you know of the world? You don&#39;t see anything but frogs and&#10;Will-o&#39;-the-Wisps!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, beware of the Will-o&#39;-the-Wisps,&#34; said the&#10;Moor-woman, &#34;for they&#39;re out&#8212;they&#39;re let loose&#8212;that&#39;s what we must&#10;talk about! Come to me in the moor, where my presence is necessary,&#10;and I will tell you all about it; but you must make haste, and come&#10;while your seven four-leaved shamrocks, for which one has six&#10;leaves, are still fresh, and the moon stands high!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the Moor-woman was gone.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;It struck twelve in the town, and before the last stroke&#10;had died away, the man was out in the yard, out in the garden, and&#10;stood in the meadow. The mist had vanished, and the Moor-woman&#10;stopped her brewing.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You&#39;ve been a long time coming!&#34; said the Moor-woman.&#10;&#34;Witches get forward faster than men, and I&#39;m glad that I belong to&#10;the witch folk!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;What have you to say to me now?&#34; asked the man. &#34;Is it&#10;anything about the Story?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Can you never get beyond asking about that?&#34; retorted the&#10;woman.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Can you tell me anything about the poetry of the future?&#34;&#10;resumed the man.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Don&#39;t get on your stilts,&#34; said the crone, &#34;and I&#39;ll&#10;answer you. You think of nothing but poetry, and only ask about&#10;that Story, as if she were the lady of the whole troop. She&#39;s the&#10;oldest of us all, but she takes precedence of the youngest. I know&#10;her well. I&#39;ve been young, too, and she&#39;s no chicken now. I was&#10;once quite a pretty elf-maiden, and have danced in my time with the&#10;others in the moonlight, and have heard the nightingale, and have&#10;gone into the forest and met the Story-maiden, who was always to be&#10;found out there, running about. Sometimes she took up her night&#39;s&#10;lodging in a half-blown tulip, or in a field flower; sometimes she&#10;would slip into the church, and wrap herself in the mourning crape&#10;that hung down from the candles on the altar.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You are capitally well-informed,&#34; said the&#10;man.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I ought at least to know as much as you,&#34; answered the&#10;Moor-woman. &#34;Stories and poetry&#8212;yes, they&#39;re like two yards of the&#10;same piece of stuff; they can go and lie down where they like, and&#10;one can brew all their prattle, and have it all the better and&#10;cheaper. You shall have it from me for nothing. I have a whole&#10;cupboard-full of poetry in bottles. It makes essences; and that&#39;s&#10;the best of it&#8212;bitter and sweet herbs. I have everything that&#10;people want of poetry, in bottles, so that I can put a little on my&#10;handkerchief, on holidays, to smell.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Why, these are wonderful things that you&#39;re telling!&#34;&#10;said the man. &#34;You have poetry in bottles?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;More than you can require,&#34; said the woman. &#34;I suppose&#10;you know the history of &#39;the Girl who Trod on the Loaf, so that she&#10;might not soil her shoes&#39;? That has been written, and printed&#10;too.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I told that story myself,&#34; said the man.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, then you must know it; and you must know also that&#10;the girl sank into the earth directly, to the Moor-woman, just as&#10;Old Bogey&#39;s grandmother was paying her morning visit to inspect the&#10;brewery. She saw the girl gliding down, and asked to have her as a&#10;remembrance of her visit, and got her too; while I received a&#10;present that&#39;s of no use to me&#8212;a travelling druggist&#39;s shop&#8212;a whole&#10;cupboard-full of poetry in bottles. Grandmother told me where the&#10;cupboard was to be placed, and there it&#39;s standing still. Just&#10;look! You&#39;ve your seven four-leaved shamrocks in your pocket, one&#10;of which is a six-leaved one, and so you will be able to see&#10;it.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And really in the midst of the moor lay something like a&#10;great knotted block of alder, and that was the old grandmother&#39;s&#10;cupboard. The Moor-woman said that this was always open to her and&#10;to every one in the land, if they only knew where the cupboard&#10;stood. It could be opened either at the front or at the back, and&#10;at every side and corner&#8212;a perfect work of art, and yet only an old&#10;alder stump in appearance. The poets of all lands, and especially&#10;those of our own country, had been arranged here; the spirit of&#10;them had been extracted, refined, criticised and renovated, and&#10;then stored up in bottles. With what may be called great aptitude,&#10;if it was not genius the grandmother had taken as it were the&#10;flavor of this and of that poet, and had added a little devilry,&#10;and then corked up the bottles for use during all future&#10;times.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Pray let me see,&#34; said the man.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, but there are more important things to hear,&#34;&#10;replied the Moor-woman.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;But now we are at the cupboard!&#34; said the man. And he&#10;looked in. &#34;Here are bottles of all sizes. What is in this one? and&#10;what in that one yonder?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Here is what they call may-balm,&#34; replied the woman. &#34;I&#10;have not tried it myself. But I have not yet told you the &#39;more&#10;important&#39; thing you were to hear. THE WILL-O&#39;-THE-WISP&#39;S IN THE&#10;TOWN! That&#39;s of much more consequence than poetry and stories. I&#10;ought, indeed, to hold my tongue; but there must be a necessity&#8212;a&#10;fate&#8212;a something that sticks in my throat, and that wants to come&#10;out. Take care, you mortals!&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I don&#39;t understand a word of all this!&#34; cried the&#10;man.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Be kind enough to seat yourself on that cupboard,&#34; she&#10;retorted, &#34;but take care you don&#39;t fall through and break the&#10;bottles&#8212;you know what&#39;s inside of them. I must tell of the great&#10;event. It occurred no longer ago than the day before yesterday. It&#10;did not happen earlier. It has now three hundred and sixty-three&#10;days to run about. I suppose you know how many days there are in a&#10;year?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And this is what the Moor-woman told:&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;There was a great commotion yesterday out here in the&#10;marsh! There was a christening feast! A little Will-o&#39;-the-Wisp was&#10;born here&#8212;in fact, twelve of them were born all together; and they&#10;have permission, if they choose to use it, to go abroad among men,&#10;and to move about and command among them, just as if they were born&#10;mortals. That was a great event in the marsh, and accordingly all&#10;the Will-o&#39;-the-Wisps, male and female, went dancing like little&#10;lights across the moor. There are some of them of the dog species,&#10;but those are not worth mentioning. I sat there on the cupboard,&#10;and had all the twelve little new-born Will-o&#39;-the-Wisps upon my&#10;lap. They shone like glow-worms; they already began to hop, and&#10;increased in size every moment, so that before a quarter of an hour&#10;had elapsed, each of them looked just as large as his father or his&#10;uncle. Now, it&#39;s an old-established regulation and favor, that when&#10;the moon stands just as it did yesterday, and the wind blows just&#10;as it blew then, it is allowed and accorded to all&#10;Will-o&#39;-the-Wisps&#8212;that is, to all those who are born at that minute&#10;of time&#8212;to become mortals, and individually to exert their power&#10;for the space of one year.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The Will-o&#39;-the-Wisp may run about in the country and&#10;through the world, if it is not afraid of falling into the sea, or&#10;of being blown out by a heavy storm. It can enter into a person and&#10;speak for him, and make all the movements it pleases. The&#10;Will-o&#39;-the-Wisp may take whatever form he likes, of man or woman,&#10;and can act in their spirit and in their disguise in such a way&#10;that he can effect whatever he wishes to do. But he must manage, in&#10;the course of the year, to lead three hundred and sixty-five people&#10;into a bad way, and in a grand style, too. To lead them away from&#10;the right and the truth; and then he reaches the highest point.&#10;Such a Will-o&#39;-the-Wisp can attain to the honor of being a runner&#10;before the devil&#39;s state coach; and then he&#39;ll wear clothes of&#10;fiery yellow, and breathe forth flames out of his throat. That&#39;s&#10;enough to make a simple Will-o&#39;-the-Wisp smack his lips. But&#10;there&#39;s some danger in this, and a great deal of work for a&#10;Will-o&#39;-the-Wisp who aspires to play so distinguished a part. If&#10;the eyes of the man are opened to what he is, and if the man can&#10;then blow him away, it&#39;s all over with him, and he must come back&#10;into the marsh; or if, before the year is up, the Will-o&#39;-the-Wisp&#10;is seized with a longing to see his family, and so returns to it&#10;and gives the matter up, it is over with him likewise, and he can&#10;no longer burn clear, and soon becomes extinguished, and cannot be&#10;lit up again; and when the year has elapsed, and he has not led&#10;three hundred and sixty-five people away from the truth and from&#10;all that is grand and noble, he is condemned to be imprisoned in&#10;decayed wood, and to lie glimmering there, without being able to&#10;move; and that&#39;s the most terrible punishment that can be inflicted&#10;on a lively Will-o&#39;-the-Wisp.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Now, all this I know, and all this I told to the twelve&#10;little Will-o&#39;-the-Wisps whom I had on my lap, and who seemed quite&#10;crazy with joy.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I told them that the safest and most convenient course&#10;was to give up the honor, and do nothing at all; but the little&#10;flames would not agree to this, and already fancied themselves clad&#10;in fiery yellow clothes, breathing flames from their&#10;throats.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;Stay with us,&#39; said some of the older ones.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;Carry on your sport with mortals,&#39; said the&#10;others.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;The mortals are drying up our meadows; they&#39;ve taken to&#10;draining. What will our successors do?&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;We want to flame; we will flame&#8212;flame!&#39; cried the&#10;new-born Will-o&#39;the-Wisps.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And thus the affair was settled.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And now a ball was given, a minute long; it could not&#10;well be shorter. The little elf-maidens whirled round three times&#10;with the rest, that they might not appear proud, but they preferred&#10;dancing with one another.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And now the sponsors&#39; gifts were presented, and presents&#10;were thrown them. These presents flew like pebbles across the&#10;sea-water. Each of the elf-maidens gave a little piece of her&#10;veil.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;&#39;Take that,&#39; they said, &#39;and then you&#39;ll know the higher&#10;dance, the most difficult turns and twists&#8212;that is to say, if you&#10;should find them necessary. You&#39;ll know the proper deportment, and&#10;then you can show yourself in the very pick of society.&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The night raven taught each of the young&#10;Will-o&#39;-the-Wisps to say, &#39;Goo-goo-good,&#39; and to say it in the&#10;right place; and that&#39;s a great gift which brings its own&#10;reward.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The owl and the stork&#8212;but they said it was not worth&#10;mentioning, and so we won&#39;t mention it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;King Waldemar&#39;s wild chase was just then rushing over the&#10;moor, and when the great lords heard of the festivities that were&#10;going on, they sent a couple of handsome dogs, which hunt on the&#10;spoor of the wind, as a present; and these might carry two or three&#10;of the Will-o&#39;-the-Wisps. A couple of old Alpas, spirits who occupy&#10;themselves with Alp-pressing, were also at the feast; and from&#10;these the young Will-o&#39;-the-Wisps learned the art of slipping&#10;through every key-hole, as if the door stood open before them.&#10;These Alpas offered to carry the youngsters to the town, with which&#10;they were well acquainted. They usually rode through the atmosphere&#10;on their own back hair, which is fastened into a knot, for they&#10;love a hard seat; but now they sat sideways on the wild hunting&#10;dogs, took the young Will-o&#39;-the-Wisps in their laps, who wanted to&#10;go into the town to mislead and entice mortals, and, whisk! away&#10;they were. Now, this is what happened last night. To-day the&#10;Will-o&#39;-the-Wisps are in the town, and have taken the matter in&#10;hand&#8212;but where and how? Ah, can you tell me that? Still, I&#39;ve a&#10;lightning conductor in my great toe, and that will always tell me&#10;something.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Why, this is a complete story,&#34; exclaimed the&#10;man.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, but it is only the beginning,&#34; replied the woman.&#10;&#34;Can you tell me how the Will-o&#39;-the-Wisps deport themselves, and&#10;how they behave? and in what shapes they have aforetime appeared&#10;and led people into crooked paths?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I believe,&#34; replied the man, &#34;that one could tell quite a&#10;romance about the Will-o&#39;-the-Wisps, in twelve parts; or, better&#10;still, one might make quite a popular play of them.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;You might write that,&#34; said the woman, &#34;but it&#39;s best let&#10;alone.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;Yes, that&#39;s better and more agreeable,&#34; the man replied,&#10;&#34;for then we shall escape from the newspapers, and not be tied up&#10;by them, which is just as uncomfortable as for a Will-o&#39;-the-Wisp&#10;to lie in decaying wood, to have to gleam, and not to be able to&#10;stir.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I don&#39;t care about it either way,&#34; cried the woman. &#34;Let&#10;the rest write, those who can, and those who cannot likewise. I&#39;ll&#10;grant you an old bung from my cask that will open the cupboard&#10;where poetry&#39;s kept in bottles, and you may take from that whatever&#10;may be wanting. But you, my good man, seem to have blotted your&#10;hands sufficiently with ink, and to have come to that age of&#10;satiety that you need not be running about every year for stories,&#10;especially as there are much more important things to be done. You&#10;must have understood what is going on?&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The Will-o&#39;-the-Wisp is in town,&#34; said the man. &#34;I&#39;ve&#10;heard it, and I have understood it. But what do you think I ought&#10;to do? I should be thrashed if I were to go to the people and say,&#10;&#39;Look, yonder goes a Will-o&#39;-the-Wisp in his best&#10;clothes!&#39;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;They also go in undress,&#34; replied the woman. &#34;The&#10;Will-o&#39;-the-Wisp can assume all kinds of forms, and appear in every&#10;place. He goes into the church, but not for the sake of the&#10;service; and perhaps he may enter into one or other of the priests.&#10;He speaks in the Parliament, not for the benefit of the country,&#10;but only for himself. He&#39;s an artist with the color-pot as well as&#10;in the theatre; but when he gets all the power into his own hands,&#10;then the pot&#39;s empty! I chatter and chatter, but it must come out,&#10;what&#39;s sticking in my throat, to the disadvantage of my own family.&#10;But I must now be the woman that will save a good many people. It&#10;is not done with my good will, or for the sake of a medal. I do the&#10;most insane things I possibly can, and then I tell a poet about it,&#10;and thus the whole town gets to know of it directly.&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The town will not take that to heart,&#34; observed the man;&#10;&#34;that will not disturb a single person; for they will all think I&#39;m&#10;only telling them a story if I say, &#39;The Will-o&#39;-the-Wisp is in the&#10;town, says the Moor-woman.

Text.create(:title => coder.decode('&#10;The Windmill'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;A WINDMILL stood upon the hill, proud to look at, and it&#10;was proud too.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I am not proud at all,&#34; it said, &#34;but I am very much&#10;enlightened without and within. I have sun and moon for my outward&#10;use, and for inward use too; and into the bargain I have stearine&#10;candles, train oil and lamps, and tallow candles. I may well say&#10;that I&#39;m enlightened. I&#39;m a thinking being, and so well constructed&#10;that it&#39;s quite delightful. I have a good windpipe in my chest, and&#10;I have four wings that are placed outside my head, just beneath my&#10;hat. The birds have only two wings, and are obliged to carry them&#10;on their backs. I am a Dutchman by birth, that may be seen by my&#10;figure&#8212;a flying Dutchman. They are considered supernatural beings,&#10;I know, and yet I am quite natural. I have a gallery round my&#10;chest, and house-room beneath it; that&#39;s where my thoughts dwell.&#10;My strongest thought, who rules and reigns, is called by others&#10;&#39;The Man in the Mill.&#39; He knows what he wants, and is lord over the&#10;meal and the bran; but he has his companion, too, and she calls&#10;herself &#39;Mother.&#39; She is the very heart of me. She does not run&#10;about stupidly and awkwardly, for she knows what she wants, she&#10;knows what she can do, she&#39;s as soft as a zephyr and as strong as a&#10;storm; she knows how to begin a thing carefully, and to have her&#10;own way. She is my soft temper, and the father is my hard one. They&#10;are two, and yet one; they each call the other &#39;My half.&#39; These two&#10;have some little boys, young thoughts, that can grow. The little&#10;ones keep everything in order. When, lately, in my wisdom, I let&#10;the father and the boys examine my throat and the hole in my chest,&#10;to see what was going on there,&#8212;for something in me was out of&#10;order, and it&#39;s well to examine one&#39;s self,&#8212;the little ones made a&#10;tremendous noise. The youngest jumped up into my hat, and shouted&#10;so there that it tickled me. The little thoughts may grow&#8212;I know&#10;that very well; and out in the world thoughts come too, and not&#10;only of my kind, for as far as I can see, I cannot discern anything&#10;like myself; but the wingless houses, whose throats make no noise,&#10;have thoughts too, and these come to my thoughts, and make love to&#10;them, as it is called. It&#39;s wonderful enough&#8212;yes, there are many&#10;wonderful things. Something has come over me, or into me,&#8212;something&#10;has changed in the mill-work. It seems as if the one half, the&#10;father, had altered, and had received a better temper and a more&#10;affectionate helpmate&#8212;so young and good, and yet the same, only&#10;more gentle and good through the course of time. What was bitter&#10;has passed away, and the whole is much more comfortable.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;The days go on, and the days come nearer and nearer to&#10;clearness and to joy; and then a day will come when it will be over&#10;with me; but not over altogether. I must be pulled down that I may&#10;be built up again; I shall cease, but yet shall live on. To become&#10;quite a different being, and yet remain the same! That&#39;s difficult&#10;for me to understand, however enlightened I may be with sun, moon,&#10;stearine, train oil, and tallow. My old wood-work and my old&#10;brick-work will rise again from the dust!&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;I will hope that I may keep my old thoughts, the father&#10;in the mill, and the mother, great ones and little ones&#8212;the family;&#10;for I call them all, great and little, the company of thoughts,&#10;because I must, and cannot refrain from it.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;&#34;And I must also remain &#39;myself,&#39; with my throat in my&#10;chest, my wings on my head, the gallery round my body; else I&#10;should not know myself, nor could the others know me, and say,&#10;&#39;There&#39;s the mill on the hill, proud to look at, and yet not proud&#10;at all.&#39;&#34;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;That is what the mill said. Indeed, it said much more, but&#10;that is the most important part.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;And the days came, and the days went, and yesterday was&#10;the last day.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Then the mill caught fire. The flames rose up high, and&#10;beat out and in, and bit at the beams and planks, and ate them up.&#10;The mill fell, and nothing remained of it but a heap of ashes. The&#10;smoke drove across the scene of the conflagration, and the wind&#10;carried it away.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;Whatever had been alive in the mill remained, and what had&#10;been gained by it has nothing to do with this story.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#60;span&#62;The miller&#39;s family&#8212;one soul, many thoughts, and yet only&#10;one&#8212;built a new, a splendid mill, which answered its purpose. It&#10;was quite like the old one, and people said, &#34;Why, yonder is the&#10;mill on the hill, proud to look at!&#34; But this mill was better&#10;arranged, more according to the time than the last, so that&#10;progress might be made. The old beams had become worm-eaten and&#10;spongy&#8212;they lay in dust and ashes. The body of the mill did not&#10;rise out of the dust as they had believed it would do. They had&#10;taken it literally, and all things are not to be taken&#10;literally.&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 4, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/4022', :deleted => 0)
