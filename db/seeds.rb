He was&#10;obliged from time to time to take journeys to arrange his affairs.&#10;One day, having to go a long way from home, he mounted his horse,&#10;taking with him a small wallet in which he had put a few biscuits&#10;and dates, because he had to pass through the desert where no food&#10;was to be got. He arrived without any mishap, and, having finished&#10;his business, set out on his return. On the fourth day of his&#10;journey, the heat of the sun being very great, he turned out of his&#10;road to rest under some trees. He found at the foot of a large&#10;walnut-tree a fountain of clear and running water. He dismounted,&#10;fastened his horse to a branch of the tree, and sat by the&#10;fountain, after having taken from his wallet some of his dates and&#10;biscuits. When he had finished this frugal meal he washed his face&#10;and hands in the fountain.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When he was thus employed he saw an enormous genius, white with&#10;rage, coming towards him, with a scimitar in his hand.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Arise,&#34; he cried in a terrible voice, &#34;and let me kill you as&#10;you have killed my son!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As he uttered these words he gave a frightful yell. The&#10;merchant, quite as much terrified at the hideous face of the&#10;monster as at his words, answered him tremblingly, &#34;Alas, good sir,&#10;what can I have done to you to deserve death?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I shall kill you,&#34; repeated the genius, &#34;as you have killed my&#10;son.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But,&#34; said the merchant, &#34;How can I have killed your son? I do&#10;not know him, and I have never even seen him.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;When you arrived here did you not sit down on the ground?&#34;&#10;asked the genius, &#34;and did you not take some dates from your&#10;wallet, and whilst eating them did not you throw the stones&#10;about?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes,&#34; said the merchant, &#34;I certainly did so.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Then,&#34; said the genius, &#34;I tell you you have killed my son, for&#10;whilst you were throwing about the stones, my son passed by, and&#10;one of them struck him in the eye and killed him. So I shall kill&#10;you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ah, sir, forgive me!&#34; cried the merchant.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I will have no mercy on you,&#34; answered the genius.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But I killed your son quite unintentionally, so I implore you&#10;to spare my life.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No,&#34; said the genius, &#34;I shall kill you as you killed my son,&#34;&#10;and so saying, he seized the merchant by the arm, threw him on the&#10;ground, and lifted his sabre to cut off his head.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The merchant, protesting his innocence, bewailed his wife and&#10;children, and tried pitifully to avert his fate. The genius, with&#10;his raised scimitar, waited till he had finished, but was not in&#10;the least touched.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Scheherazade, at this point, seeing that it was day, and knowing&#10;that the Sultan always rose very early to attend the council,&#10;stopped speaking.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Indeed, sister,&#34; said Dinarzade, &#34;this is a wonderful&#10;story.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The rest is still more wonderful,&#34; replied Scheherazade, &#34;and&#10;you would say so, if the sultan would allow me to live another day,&#10;and would give me leave to tell it to you the next night.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Schahriar, who had been listening to Scheherazade with pleasure,&#10;said to himself, &#34;I will wait till to-morrow; I can always have her&#10;killed when I have heard the end of her story.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;All this time the grand-vizir was in a terrible state of&#10;anxiety. But he was much delighted when he saw the Sultan enter the&#10;council-chamber without giving the terrible command that he was&#10;expecting.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The next morning, before the day broke, Dinarzade said to her&#10;sister, &#34;Dear sister, if you are awake I pray you to go on with&#10;your story.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Sultan did not wait for Scheherazade to ask his leave.&#10;&#34;Finish,&#34; said he, &#34;the story of the genius and the merchant. I am&#10;curious to hear the end.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So Scheherazade went on with the story. This happened every&#10;morning. The Sultana told a story, and the Sultan let her live to&#10;finish it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When the merchant saw that the genius was determined to cut off&#10;his head, he said: &#34;One word more, I entreat you. Grant me a little&#10;delay; just a short time to go home and bid my wife and children&#10;farewell, and to make my will. When I have done this I will come&#10;back here, and you shall kill me.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But,&#34; said the genius, &#34;if I grant you the delay you ask, I am&#10;afraid that you will not come back.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I give you my word of honour,&#34; answered the merchant, &#34;that I&#10;will come back without fail.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;How long do you require?&#34; asked the genius.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I ask you for a year&#39;s grace,&#34; replied the merchant. &#34;I promise&#10;you that to-morrow twelvemonth, I shall be waiting under these&#10;trees to give myself up to you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;On this the genius left him near the fountain and&#10;disappeared.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The merchant, having recovered from his fright, mounted his&#10;horse and went on his road.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When he arrived home his wife and children received him with the&#10;greatest joy. But instead of embracing them he began to weep so&#10;bitterly that they soon guessed that something terrible was the&#10;matter.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Tell us, I pray you,&#34; said his wife, &#34;what has happened.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Alas!&#34; answered her husband, &#34;I have only a year to live.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then he told them what had passed between him and the genius,&#10;and how he had given his word to return at the end of a year to be&#10;killed. When they heard this sad news they were in despair, and&#10;wept much.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The next day the merchant began to settle his affairs, and first&#10;of all to pay his debts. He gave presents to his friends, and large&#10;alms to the poor. He set his slaves at liberty, and provided for&#10;his wife and children. The year soon passed away, and he was&#10;obliged to depart. When he tried to say good-bye he was quite&#10;overcome with grief, and with difficulty tore himself away. At&#10;length he reached the place where he had first seen the genius, on&#10;the very day that he had appointed. He dismounted, and sat down at&#10;the edge of the fountain, where he awaited the genius in terrible&#10;suspense.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Whilst he was thus waiting an old man leading a hind came&#10;towards him. They greeted one another, and then the old man said to&#10;him, &#34;May I ask, brother, what brought you to this desert place,&#10;where there are so many evil genii about? To see these beautiful&#10;trees one would imagine it was inhabited, but it is a dangerous&#10;place to stop long in.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The merchant told the old man why he was obliged to come there.&#10;He listened in astonishment.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;This is a most marvellous affair. I should like to be a witness&#10;of your interview with the genius.&#34; So saying he sat down by the&#10;merchant.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;While they were talking another old man came up, followed by two&#10;black dogs. He greeted them, and asked what they were doing in this&#10;place. The old man who was leading the hind told him the adventure&#10;of the merchant and the genius. The second old man had not sooner&#10;heard the story than he, too, decided to stay there to see what&#10;would happen. He sat down by the others, and was talking, when a&#10;third old man arrived. He asked why the merchant who was with them&#10;looked so sad. They told him the story, and he also resolved to see&#10;what would pass between the genius and the merchant, so waited with&#10;the rest.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;They soon saw in the distance a thick smoke, like a cloud of&#10;dust. This smoke came nearer and nearer, and then, all at once, it&#10;vanished, and they saw the genius, who, without speaking to them,&#10;approached the merchant, sword in hand, and, taking him by the arm,&#10;said, &#34;Get up and let me kill you as you killed my son.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The merchant and the three old men began to weep and groan.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then the old man leading the hind threw himself at the monster&#39;s&#10;feet and said, &#34;O Prince of the Genii, I beg of you to stay your&#10;fury and to listen to me. I am going to tell you my story and that&#10;of the hind I have with me, and if you find it more marvellous than&#10;that of the merchant whom you are about to kill, I hope that you&#10;will do away with a third part of his punishment?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The genius considered some time, and then he said, &#34;Very well, I&#10;agree to this.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 3, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/208', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('The Story of the First Old Man and of the&#10;Hind'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;I am now going to begin my story (said the old man), so please&#10;attend.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;This hind that you see with me is my wife. We have no children&#10;of our own, therefore I adopted the son of a favorite slave, and&#10;determined to make him my heir.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;My wife, however, took a great dislike to both mother and child,&#10;which she concealed from me till too late. When my adopted son was&#10;about ten years old I was obliged to go on a journey. Before I went&#10;I entrusted to my wife&#39;s keeping both the mother and child, and&#10;begged her to take care of them during my absence, which lasted a&#10;whole year. During this time she studied magic in order to carry&#10;out her wicked scheme. When she had learnt enough she took my son&#10;into a distant place and changed him into a calf. Then she gave him&#10;to my steward, and told him to look after a calf she had bought.&#10;She also changed the slave into a cow, which she sent to my&#10;steward.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When I returned I inquired after my slave and the child. &#34;Your&#10;slave is dead,&#34; she said, &#34;and as for your son, I have not seen him&#10;for two months, and I do not know where he is.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I was grieved to hear of my slave&#39;s death, but as my son had&#10;only disappeared, I thought I should soon find him. Eight months,&#10;however, passed, and still no tidings of him; then the feast of&#10;Bairam came.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;To celebrate it I ordered my steward to bring me a very fat cow&#10;to sacrifice. He did so. The cow that he brought was my unfortunate&#10;slave. I bound her, but just as I was about to kill her she began&#10;to low most piteously, and I saw that her eyes were streaming with&#10;tears. It seemed to me most extraordinary, and, feeling a movement&#10;of pity, I ordered the steward to lead her away and bring another.&#10;My wife, who was present, scoffed at my compassion, which made her&#10;malice of no avail. &#34;What are you doing?&#34; she cried. &#34;Kill this&#10;cow. It is the best we have to sacrifice.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;To please her, I tried again, but again the animal&#39;s lows and&#10;tears disarmed me.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Take her away,&#34; I said to the steward, &#34;and kill her; I&#10;cannot.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The steward killed her, but on skinning her found that she was&#10;nothing but bones, although she appeared so fat. I was vexed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Keep her for yourself,&#34; I said to the steward, &#34;and if you have&#10;a fat calf, bring that in her stead.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In a short time he brought a very fat calf, which, although I&#10;did not know it, was my son. It tried hard to break its cord and&#10;come to me. It threw itself at my feet, with its head on the&#10;ground, as if it wished to excite my pity, and to beg me not to&#10;take away its life.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I was even more surprised and touched at this action than I had&#10;been at the tears of the cow.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Go,&#34; I said to the steward, &#34;take back this calf, take great&#10;care of it, and bring me another in its place instantly.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As soon as my wife heard me speak this she at once cried out,&#10;&#34;What are you doing, husband? Do not sacrifice any calf but&#10;this.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Wife,&#34; I answered, &#34;I will not sacrifice this calf,&#34; and in&#10;spite of all her remonstrances, I remained firm.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I had another calf killed; this one was led away. The next day&#10;the steward asked to speak to me in private.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I have come,&#34; he said, &#34;to tell you some news which I think you&#10;will like to hear. I have a daughter who knows magic. Yesterday,&#10;when I was leading back the calf which you refused to sacrifice, I&#10;noticed that she smiled, and then directly afterwards began to cry.&#10;I asked her why she did so.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Father,&#34; she answered, &#34;this calf is the son of our master. I&#10;smile with joy at seeing him still alive, and I weep to think of&#10;his mother, who was sacrificed yesterday as a cow. These changes&#10;have been wrought by our master&#39;s wife, who hated the mother and&#10;son.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;At these words, of Genius,&#34; continued the old man, &#34;I leave you&#10;to imagine my astonishment. I went immediately with the steward to&#10;speak with his daughter myself. First of all I went to the stable&#10;to see my son, and he replied in his dumb way to all my caresses.&#10;When the steward&#39;s daughter came I asked her if she could change my&#10;son back to his proper shape.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, I can,&#34; she replied, &#34;on two conditions. One is that you&#10;will give him to me for a husband, and the other is that you will&#10;let me punish the woman who changed him into a calf.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;To the first condition,&#34; I answered, &#34;I agree with all my&#10;heart, and I will give you an ample dowry. To the second I also&#10;agree, I only beg you to spare her life.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That I will do,&#34; she replied; &#34;I will treat her as she treated&#10;your son.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then she took a vessel of water and pronounced over it some&#10;words I did not understand; then, on throwing the water over him,&#10;he became immediately a young man once more.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My son, my dear son,&#34; I exclaimed, kissing him in a transport&#10;of joy. &#34;This kind maiden has rescued you from a terrible&#10;enchantment, and I am sure that out of gratitude you will marry&#10;her.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He consented joyfully, but before they were married, the young&#10;girl changed my wife into a hind, and it is she whom you see before&#10;you. I wished her to have this form rather than a stranger one, so&#10;that we could see her in the family without repugnance.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Since then my son has become a widower and has gone travelling.&#10;I am now going in search of him, and not wishing to confide my wife&#10;to the care of other people, I am taking her with me. Is this not a&#10;most marvellous tale?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It is indeed,&#34; said the genius, &#34;and because of it I grant to&#10;you the third part of the punishment of this merchant.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When the first old man had finished his story, the second, who&#10;was leading the two black dogs, said to the genius, &#34;I am going to&#10;tell you what happened to me, and I am sure that you will find my&#10;story even more astonishing than the one to which you have just&#10;been listening. But when I have related it, will you grant me also&#10;the third part of the merchant&#39;s punishment?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes,&#34; replied the genius, &#34;provided that your story surpasses&#10;that of the hind.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With this agreement the second old man began in this way.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 3, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/208', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('The Story of the Second Old Man, and of&#10;the Two Black Dogs'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;Great prince of the genii, you must know that we are three&#10;brothers&#8212; these two black dogs and myself. Our father died, leaving&#10;us each a thousand sequins. With this sum we all three took up the&#10;same profession, and became merchants. A short time after we had&#10;opened our shops, my eldest brother, one of these two dogs,&#10;resolved to travel in foreign countries for the sake of&#10;merchandise. With this intention he sold all he had and bought&#10;merchandise suitable to the voyages he was about to make. He set&#10;out, and was away a whole year. At the end of this time a beggar&#10;came to my shop. &#34;Good-day,&#34; I said. &#34;Good-day,&#34; he answered; &#34;is&#10;it possible that you do not recognise me?&#34; Then I looked at him&#10;closely and saw he was my brother. I made him come into my house,&#10;and asked him how he had fared in his enterprise.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Do not question me,&#34; he replied, &#34;see me, you see all I have.&#10;It would but renew my trouble to tell of all the misfortunes that&#10;have befallen me in a year, and have brought me to this state.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I shut up my shop, paid him every attention, taking him to the&#10;bath, giving him my most beautiful robes. I examined my accounts,&#10;and found that I had doubled my capital&#8212;that is, that I now&#10;possessed two thousand sequins. I gave my brother half, saying:&#10;&#34;Now, brother, you can forget your losses.&#34; He accepted them with&#10;joy, and we lived together as we had before.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Some time afterwards my second brother wished also to sell his&#10;business and travel. My eldest brother and I did all we could to&#10;dissuade him, but it was of no use. He joined a caravan and set&#10;out. He came back at the end of a year in the same state as his&#10;elder brother. I took care of him, and as I had a thousand sequins&#10;to spare I gave them to him, and he re-opened his shop.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;One day, my two brothers came to me to propose that we should&#10;make a journey and trade. At first I refused to go. &#34;You&#10;travelled,&#34; I said, &#34;and what did you gain?&#34; But they came to me&#10;repeatedly, and after having held out for five years I at last gave&#10;way. But when they had made their preparation, and they began to&#10;buy the merchandise we needed, they found they had spent every&#10;piece of the thousand sequins I had given them. I did not reproach&#10;them. I divided my six thousand sequins with them, giving a&#10;thousand to each and keeping one for myself, and the other three I&#10;buried in a corner of my house. We bought merchandise, loaded a&#10;vessel with it, and set forth with a favorable wind.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;After two months&#39; sailing we arrived at a seaport, where we&#10;disembarked and did a great trade. Then we bought the merchandise&#10;of the country, and were just going to sail once more, when I was&#10;stopped on the shore by a beautiful though poorly dressed woman.&#10;She came up to me, kissed my hand, and implored me to marry her,&#10;and take her on board. At first I refused, but she begged so hard&#10;and promised to be such a good wife to me, that at last I&#10;consented. I got her some beautiful dresses, and after having&#10;married her, we embarked and set sail. During the voyage, I&#10;discovered so many good qualities in my wife that I began to lover&#10;her more and more. But my brothers began to be jealous of my&#10;prosperity, and set to work to plot against my life. One night when&#10;we were sleeping they threw my wife and myself into the sea. My&#10;wife, however, was a fairy, and so she did not let me drown, but&#10;transported me to an island. When the day dawned, she said to&#10;me,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;When I saw you on the sea-shore I took a great fancy to you,&#10;and wished to try your good nature, so I presented myself in the&#10;disguise you saw. Now I have rewarded you by saving your life. But&#10;I am very angry with your brothers, and I shall not rest till I&#10;have taken their lives.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I thanked the fairy for all that she had done for me, but I&#10;begged her not to kill my brothers.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I appeased her wrath, and in a moment she transported me from&#10;the island where we were to the roof of my house, and she&#10;disappeared a moment afterwards. I went down, and opened the doors,&#10;and dug up the three thousand sequins which I had buried. I went to&#10;the place where my shop was, opened it, and received from my&#10;fellow-merchants congratulations on my return. When I went home, I&#10;saw two black dogs who came to meet me with sorrowful faces. I was&#10;much astonished, but the fairy who reappeared said to me,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Do not be surprised to see these dogs; they are your two&#10;brothers. I have condemned them to remain for ten years in these&#10;shapes.&#34; Then having told me where I could hear news of her, she&#10;vanished.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The ten years are nearly passed, and I am on the road to find&#10;her. As in passing I met this merchant and the old man with the&#10;hind, I stayed with them.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;This is my history, O prince of genii! Do you not think it is a&#10;most marvellous one?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, indeed,&#34; replied the genius, &#34;and I will give up to you&#10;the third of the merchant&#39;s punishment.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then the third old man made the genius the same request as the&#10;other two had done, and the genius promised him the last third of&#10;the merchant&#39;s punishment if his story surpassed both the&#10;others.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So he told his story to the genius, but I cannot tell you what&#10;it was, as I do not know.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But I do know that it was even more marvellous than either of&#10;the others, so that the genius was astonished, and said to the&#10;third old man, &#34;I will give up to you the third part of the&#10;merchant&#39;s punishment. He ought to thank all three of you for&#10;having interested yourselves in his favour. But for you, he would&#10;be here no longer.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So saying, he disappeared, to the great joy of the company. The&#10;merchant did not fail to thank his friends, and then each went on&#10;his way. The merchant returned to his wife and children, and passed&#10;the rest of his days happily with them.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But, sire,&#34; added Scheherazade, &#34;however beautiful are the&#10;stories I have just told you, they cannot compare with the story of&#10;the Fisherman.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 3, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/208', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('The Story of the Fisherman'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;Sire, there was once upon a time a fisherman so old and so poor&#10;that he could scarcely manage to support his wife and three&#10;children. He went every day to fish very early, and each day he&#10;made a rule not to throw his nets more than four times. He started&#10;out one morning by moonlight and came to the sea-shore. He&#10;undressed and threw his nets, and as he was drawing them towards&#10;the bank he felt a great weight. He though he had caught a large&#10;fish, and he felt very pleased. But a moment afterwards, seeing&#10;that instead of a fish he only had in his nets the carcase of an&#10;ass, he was much disappointed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Vexed with having such a bad haul, when he had mended his nets,&#10;which the carcase of the ass had broken in several places, he threw&#10;them a second time. In drawing them in he again felt a great&#10;weight, so that he thought they were full of fish. But he only&#10;found a large basket full of rubbish. He was much annoyed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;O Fortune,&#34; he cried, &#34;do not trifle thus with me, a poor&#10;fisherman, who can hardly support his family!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So saying, he threw away the rubbish, and after having washed&#10;his nets clean of the dirt, he threw them for the third time. But&#10;he only drew in stones, shells, and mud. He was almost in&#10;despair.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then he threw his nets for the fourth time. When he thought he&#10;had a fish he drew them in with a great deal of trouble. There was&#10;no fish however, but he found a yellow pot, which by its weight&#10;seemed full of something, and he noticed that it was fastened and&#10;sealed with lead, with the impression of a seal. He was delighted.&#10;&#34;I will sell it to the founder,&#34; he said; &#34;with the money I shall&#10;get for it I shall buy a measure of wheat.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He examined the jar on all sides; he shook it to see if it would&#10;rattle. But he heard nothing, and so, judging from the impression&#10;of the seal and the lid, he thought there must be something&#10;precious inside. To find out, he took his knife, and with a little&#10;trouble he opened it. He turned it upside down, but nothing came&#10;out, which surprised him very much. He set it in front of him, and&#10;whilst he was looking at it attentively, such a thick smoke came&#10;out that he had to step back a pace or two. This smoke rose up to&#10;the clouds, and stretching over the sea and the shore, formed a&#10;thick mist, which caused the fisherman much astonishment. When all&#10;the smoke was out of the jar it gathered itself together, and&#10;became a thick mass in which appeared a genius, twice as large as&#10;the largest giant. When he saw such a terrible-looking monster, the&#10;fisherman would like to have run away, but he trembled so with&#10;fright that he could not move a step.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Great king of the genii,&#34; cried the monster, &#34;I will never&#10;again disobey you!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At these words the fisherman took courage.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What is this you are saying, great genius? Tell me your history&#10;and how you came to be shut up in that vase.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At this, the genius looked at the fisherman haughtily. &#34;Speak to&#10;me more civilly,&#34; he said, &#34;before I kill you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Alas! why should you kill me?&#34; cried the fisherman. &#34;I have&#10;just freed you; have you already forgotten that?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No,&#34; answered the genius; &#34;but that will not prevent me from&#10;killing you; and I am only going to grant you one favour, and that&#10;is to choose the manner of your death.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But what have I done to you?&#34; asked the fisherman.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I cannot treat you in any other way,&#34; said the genius, &#34;and if&#10;you would know why, listen to my story.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I rebelled against the king of the genii. To punish me, he shut&#10;me up in this vase of copper, and he put on the leaden cover his&#10;seal, which is enchantment enough to prevent my coming out. Then he&#10;had the vase thrown into the sea. During the first period of my&#10;captivity I vowed that if anyone should free me before a hundred&#10;years were passed, I would make him rich even after his death. But&#10;that century passed, and no one freed me. In the second century I&#10;vowed that I would give all the treasures in the world to my&#10;deliverer; but he never came.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;In the third, I promised to make him a king, to be always near&#10;him, and to grant him three wishes every day; but that century&#10;passed away as the other two had done, and I remained in the same&#10;plight. At last I grew angry at being captive for so long, and I&#10;vowed that if anyone would release me I would kill him at once, and&#10;would only allow him to choose in what manner he should die. So you&#10;see, as you have freed me to-day, choose in what way you will&#10;die.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The fisherman was very unhappy. &#34;What an unlucky man I am to&#10;have freed you! I implore you to spare my life.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I have told you,&#34; said the genius, &#34;that it is impossible.&#10;Choose quickly; you are wasting time.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The fisherman began to devise a plot.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Since I must die,&#34; he said, &#34;before I choose the manner of my&#10;death, I conjure you on your honour to tell me if you really were&#10;in that vase?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, I was&#34; answered the genius.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I really cannot believe it,&#34; said the fisherman. &#34;That vase&#10;could not contain one of your feet even, and how could your whole&#10;body go in? I cannot believe it unless I see you do the thing.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then the genius began to change himself into smoke, which, as&#10;before, spread over the sea and the shore, and which, then&#10;collecting itself together, began to go back into the vase slowly&#10;and evenly till there was nothing left outside. Then a voice came&#10;from the vase which said to the fisherman, &#34;Well, unbelieving&#10;fisherman, here I am in the vase; do you believe me now?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The fisherman instead of answering took the lid of lead and shut&#10;it down quickly on the vase.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Now, O genius,&#34; he cried, &#34;ask pardon of me, and choose by what&#10;death you will die! But no, it will be better if I throw you into&#10;the sea whence I drew you out, and I will build a house on the&#10;shore to warn fishermen who come to cast their nets here, against&#10;fishing up such a wicked genius as you are, who vows to kill the&#10;man who frees you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At these words the genius did all he could to get out, but he&#10;could not, because of the enchantment of the lid.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then he tried to get out by cunning.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;If you will take off the cover,&#34; he said, &#34;I will repay&#10;you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No,&#34; answered the fisherman, &#34;if I trust myself to you I am&#10;afraid you will treat me as a certain Greek king treated the&#10;physician Douban.

Text.create(:title => coder.decode('The Story of the Greek King and the&#10;Physician Douban'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;In the country of Zouman, in Persia, there lived a Greek king.&#10;This king was a leper, and all his doctors had been unable to cure&#10;him, when a very clever physician came to his court.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He was very learned in all languages, and knew a great deal&#10;about herbs and medicines.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As soon as he was told of the king&#39;s illness he put on his best&#10;robe and presented himself before the king. &#34;Sire,&#34; said he, &#34;I&#10;know that no physician has been able to cure your majesty, but if&#10;you will follow my instructions, I will promise to cure you without&#10;any medicines or outward application.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The king listened to this proposal.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;If you are clever enough to do this,&#34; he said, &#34;I promise to&#10;make you and your descendants rich for ever.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The physician went to his house and made a polo club, the handle&#10;of which he hollowed out, and put in it the drug he wished to use.&#10;Then he made a ball, and with these things he went the next day to&#10;the king.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He told him that he wished him to play at polo. Accordingly the&#10;king mounted his horse and went into the place where he played.&#10;There the physician approached him with the bat he had made,&#10;saying, &#34;Take this, sire, and strike the ball till you feel your&#10;hand and whole body in a glow. When the remedy that is in the&#10;handle of the club is warmed by your hand it will penetrate&#10;throughout your body. The you must return to your palace, bathe,&#10;and go to sleep, and when you awake to-morrow morning you will be&#10;cured.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The king took the club and urged his horse after the ball which&#10;he had thrown. He struck it, and then it was hit back by the&#10;courtiers who were playing with him. When he felt very hot he&#10;stopped playing, and went back to the palace, went into the bath,&#10;and did all that the physician had said. The next day when he arose&#10;he found, to his great joy and astonishment, that he was completely&#10;cured. When he entered his audience-chamber all his courtiers, who&#10;were eager to see if the wonderful cure had been effected, were&#10;overwhelmed with joy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The physician Douban entered the hall and bowed low to the&#10;ground. The king, seeing him, called him, made him sit by his side,&#10;and showed him every mark of honour.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;That evening he gave him a long and rich robe of state, and&#10;presented him with two thousand sequins. The following day he&#10;continued to load him with favours.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now the king had a grand-vizir who was avaricious, and envious,&#10;and a very bad man. He grew extremely jealous of the physician, and&#10;determined to bring about his ruin.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In order to do this he asked to speak in private with the king,&#10;saying that he had a most important communication to make.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What is it?&#34; asked the king.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Sire,&#34; answered the grand-vizir, &#34;it is most dangerous for a&#10;monarch to confide in a man whose faithfulness is not proved, You&#10;do not know that this physician is not a traitor come here to&#10;assassinate you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I am sure,&#34; said the king, &#34;that this man is the most faithful&#10;and virtuous of men. If he wished to take my life, why did he cure&#10;me? Cease to speak against him. I see what it is, you are jealous&#10;of him; but do not think that I can be turned against him. I&#10;remember well what a vizir said to King Sindbad, his master, to&#10;prevent him from putting the prince, his son, to death.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;What the Greek king said excited the vizir&#39;s curiousity, and he&#10;said to him, &#34;Sire, I beg your majesty to have the condescension to&#10;tell me what the vizir said to King Sindbad.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;This vizir,&#34; he replied, &#34;told King Sindbad that one ought not&#10;believe everything that a mother-in-law says, and told him this&#10;story.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 3, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/208', :deleted => 0)

One day, when he was obliged by important&#10;business to go away from her, he went to a place where all kinds of&#10;birds are sold and bought a parrot. This parrot not only spoke&#10;well, but it had the gift of telling all that had been done before&#10;it. He brought it home in a cage, and asked his wife to put it in&#10;her room, and take great care of it while he was away. Then he&#10;departed. On his return he asked the parrot what had happened&#10;during his absence, and the parrot told him some things which made&#10;him scold his wife.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She thought that one of her slaves must have been telling tales&#10;of her, but they told her it was the parrot, and she resolved to&#10;revenge herself on him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When her husband next went away for one day, she told on slave&#10;to turn under the bird&#39;s cage a hand-mill; another to throw water&#10;down from above the cage, and a third to take a mirror and turn it&#10;in front of its eyes, from left to right by the light of a candle.&#10;The slaves did this for part of the night, and did it very&#10;well.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The next day when the husband came back he asked the parrot what&#10;he had seen. The bird replied, &#34;My good master, the lightning,&#10;thunder and rain disturbed me so much all night long, that I cannot&#10;tell you what I have suffered.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The husband, who knew that it had neither rained nor thundered&#10;in the night, was convinced that the parrot was not speaking the&#10;truth, so he took him out of the cage and threw him so roughly on&#10;the ground that he killed him. Nevertheless he was sorry&#10;afterwards, for he found that the parrot had spoken the truth.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;When the Greek king,&#34; said the fisherman to the genius, &#34;had&#10;finished the story of the parrot, he added to the vizir, &#34;And so,&#10;vizir, I shall not listen to you, and I shall take care of the&#10;physician, in case I repent as the husband did when he had killed&#10;the parrot.&#34; But the vizir was determined. &#34;Sire,&#34; he replied, &#34;the&#10;death of the parrot was nothing. But when it is a question of the&#10;life of a king it is better to sacrifice the innocent than save the&#10;guilty. It is no uncertain thing, however. The physician, Douban,&#10;wishes to assassinate you. My zeal prompts me to disclose this to&#10;your Majesty. If I am wrong, I deserve to be punished as a vizir&#10;was once punished.&#34; &#34;What had the vizir done,&#34; said the Greek king,&#10;&#34;to merit the punishment?&#34; &#34;I will tell your Majesty, if you will&#10;do me the honour to listen,&#34; answered the vizir.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 3, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/208', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('The Story of the Vizir Who Was&#10;Punished'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;There was once upon a time a king who had a son who was very&#10;fond of hunting. He often allowed him to indulge in this pastime,&#10;but he had ordered his grand-vizir always to go with him, and never&#10;to lose sight of him. One day the huntsman roused a stag, and the&#10;prince, thinking that the vizir was behind, gave chase, and rode so&#10;hard that he found himself alone. He stopped, and having lost sight&#10;of it, he turned to rejoin the vizir, who had not been careful&#10;enough to follow him. But he lost his way. Whilst he was trying to&#10;find it, he saw on the side of the road a beautiful lady who was&#10;crying bitterly. He drew his horse&#39;s rein, and asked her who she&#10;was and what she was doing in this place, and if she needed help.&#10;&#34;I am the daughter of an Indian king,&#34; she answered, &#34;and whilst&#10;riding in the country I fell asleep and tumbled off. My horse has&#10;run away, and I do not know what has become of him.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The young prince had pity on her, and offered to take her behind&#10;him, which he did. As they passed by a ruined building the lady&#10;dismounted and went in. The prince also dismounted and followed&#10;her. To his great surprise, he heard her saying to some one inside,&#10;&#34;Rejoice my children; I am bringing you a nice fat youth.&#34; And&#10;other voices replied, &#34;Where is he, mamma, that we may eat him at&#10;once, as we are very hungry?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The prince at once saw the danger he was in. He now knew that&#10;the lady who said she was the daughter of an Indian king was an&#10;ogress, who lived in desolate places, and who by a thousand wiles&#10;surprised and devoured passers-by. He was terrified, and threw&#10;himself on his horse. The pretended princess appeared at this&#10;moment, and seeing that she had lost her prey, she said to him, &#34;Do&#10;not be afraid. What do you want?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I am lost,&#34; he answered, &#34;and I am looking for the road.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Keep straight on,&#34; said the ogress, &#34;and you will find it.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The prince could hardly believe his ears, and rode off as hard&#10;as he could. He found his way, and arrived safe and sound at his&#10;father&#39;s house, where he told him of the danger he had run because&#10;of the grand-vizir&#39;s carelessness. The king was very angry, and had&#10;him strangled immediately.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Sire,&#34; went on the vizir to the Greek king, &#34;to return to the&#10;physician, Douban. If you do not take care, you will repent of&#10;having trusted him. Who knows what this remedy, with which he has&#10;cured you, may not in time have a bad effect on you?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Greek king was naturally very weak, and did not perceive the&#10;wicked intention of his vizir, nor was he firm enough to keep to&#10;his first resolution.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well, vizir,&#34; he said, &#34;you are right. Perhaps he did come to&#10;take my life. He might do it by the mere smell of one of his drugs.&#10;I must see what can be done.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The best means, sire, to put your life in security, is to send&#10;for him at once, and to cut off his head directly he comes,&#34; said&#10;the vizir.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I really think,&#34; replied the king, &#34;that will be the best&#10;way.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He then ordered one of his ministers to fetch the physician, who&#10;came at once.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I have had you sent for,&#34; said the king, &#34;in order to free&#10;myself from you by taking your life.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The physician was beyond measure astonished when he heard he was&#10;to die.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What crimes have I committed, your majesty?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I have learnt,&#34; replied the king, &#34;that you are a spy, and&#10;intend to kill me. But I will be first, and kill you. Strike,&#34; he&#10;added to an executioner who was by, &#34;and rid me of this&#10;assassin.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At this cruel order the physician threw himself on his knees.&#10;&#34;Spare my life,&#34; he cried, &#34;and yours will be spared.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The fisherman stopped here to say to the genius: &#34;You see what&#10;passed between the Greek king and the physician has just passed&#10;between us two. The Greek king,&#34; he went on, &#34;had no mercy on him,&#10;and the executioner bound his eyes.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;All those present begged for his life, but in vain.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The physician on his knees, and bound, said to the king: &#34;At&#10;least let me put my affairs in order, and leave my books to persons&#10;who will make good use of them. There is one which I should like to&#10;present to your majesty. It is very precious, and ought to be kept&#10;carefully in your treasury. It contains many curious things the&#10;chief being that when you cut off my head, if your majesty will&#10;turn to the sixth leaf, and read the third line of the left-hand&#10;page, my head will answer all the questions you like to ask&#10;it.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The king, eager to see such a wonderful thing, put off his&#10;execution to the next day, and sent him under a strong guard to his&#10;house. There the physician put his affairs in order, and the next&#10;day there was a great crowd assembled in the hall to see his death,&#10;and the doings after it. The physician went up to the foot of the&#10;throne with a large book in his hand. He carried a basin, on which&#10;he spread the covering of the book, and presenting it to the king,&#10;said: &#34;Sire, take this book, and when my head is cut off, let it be&#10;placed in the basin on the covering of this book; as soon as it is&#10;there, the blood will cease to flow. Then open the book, and my&#10;head will answer your questions. But, sire, I implore your mercy,&#10;for I am innocent.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Your prayers are useless, and if it were only to hear your head&#10;speak when you are dead, you should die.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So saying, he took the book from the physician&#39;s hands, and&#10;ordered the executioner to do his duty.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The head was so cleverly cut off that it fell into the basin,&#10;and directly the blood ceased to flow. Then, to the great&#10;astonishment of the king, the eyes opened, and the head said, &#34;Your&#10;majesty, open the book.&#34; The king did so, and finding that the&#10;first leaf stuck against the second, he put his finger in his&#10;mouth, to turn it more easily. He did the same thing till he&#10;reached the sixth page, and not seeing any writing on it,&#10;&#34;Physician,&#34; he said, &#34;there is no writing.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Turn over a few more pages,&#34; answered the head. The king went&#10;on turning, still putting his finger in his mouth, till the poison&#10;in which each page was dipped took effect. His sight failed him,&#10;and he fell at the foot of his throne.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When the physician&#39;s head saw that the poison had taken effect,&#10;and that the king had only a few more minutes to live, &#34;Tyrant,&#34; it&#10;cried, &#34;see how cruelty and injustice are punished.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Scarcely had it uttered these words than the king died, and the&#10;head lost also the little life that had remained in it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;That is the end of the story of the Greek king, and now let us&#10;return to the fisherman and the genius.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;If the Greek king,&#34; said the fisherman, &#34;had spared the&#10;physician, he would not have thus died. The same thing applies to&#10;you. Now I am going to throw you into the sea.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My friend,&#34; said the genius, &#34;do not do such a cruel thing. Do&#10;not treat me as Imma treated Ateca.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What did Imma do to Ateca?&#34; asked the fisherman.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Do you think I can tell you while I am shut up in here?&#34;&#10;replied the genius. &#34;Let me out, and I will make you rich.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The hope of being no longer poor made the fisherman give&#10;way.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;If you will give me your promise to do this, I will open the&#10;lid. I do not think you will dare to break your word.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The genius promised, and the fisherman lifted the lid. He came&#10;out at once in smoke, and then, having resumed his proper form, the&#10;first thing he did was to kick the vase into the sea. This&#10;frightened the fisherman, but the genius laughed and said, &#34;Do not&#10;be afraid; I only did it to frighten you, and to show you that I&#10;intend to keep my word; take your nets and follow me.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He began to walk in front of the fisherman, who followed him&#10;with some misgivings. They passed in front of the town, and went up&#10;a mountain and then down into a great plain, where there was a&#10;large lake lying between four hills.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When they reached the lake the genius said to the fisherman,&#10;&#34;Throw your nets and catch fish.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The fisherman did as he was told, hoping for a good catch, as he&#10;saw plenty of fish. What was his astonishment at seeing that there&#10;were four quite different kinds, some white, some red, some blue,&#10;and some yellow. He caught four, one of each colour. As he had&#10;never seen any like them he admired them very much, and he was very&#10;pleased to think how much money he would get for them.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Take these fish and carry them to the Sultan, who will give you&#10;more money for them than you have ever had in your life. You can&#10;come every day to fish in this lake, but be careful not to throw&#10;your nets more than once every day, otherwise some harm will happen&#10;to you. If you follow my advice carefully you will find it&#10;good.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Saying these words, he struck his foot against the ground, which&#10;opened, and when he had disappeared, it closed immediately.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The fisherman resolved to obey the genius exactly, so he did not&#10;cast his nets a second time, but walked into the town to sell his&#10;fish at the palace.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When the Sultan saw the fish he was much astonished. He looked&#10;at them one after the other, and when he had admired them long&#10;enough, &#34;Take these fish,&#34; he said to his first vizir, &#34;and given&#10;them to the clever cook the Emperor of the Greeks sent me. I think&#10;they must be as good as they are beautiful.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The vizir took them himself to the cook, saying, &#34;Here are four&#10;fish that have been brought to the Sultan. He wants you to cook&#10;them.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then he went back to the Sultan, who told him to give the&#10;fisherman four hundred gold pieces. The fisherman, who had never&#10;before possessed such a large sum of money at once, could hardly&#10;believe his good fortune. He at once relieved the needs of his&#10;family, and made good use of it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But now we must return to the kitchen, which we shall find in&#10;great confusion. The cook, when she had cleaned the fish, put them&#10;in a pan with some oil to fry them. When she thought them cooked&#10;enough on one side she turned them on the other. But scarcely had&#10;she done so when the walls of the kitchen opened, and there came&#10;out a young and beautiful damsel. She was dressed in an Egyptian&#10;dress of flowered satin, and she wore earrings, and a necklace of&#10;white pearls, and bracelets of gold set with rubies, and she held a&#10;wand of myrtle in her hand.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She went up to the pan, to the great astonishment of the cook,&#10;who stood motionless at the sight of her. She struck one of the&#10;fish with her rod, &#34;Fish, fish,&#34; said she, &#34;are you doing your&#10;duty?&#34; The fish answered nothing, and then she repeated her&#10;question, whereupon they all raised their heads together and&#10;answered very distinctly, &#34;Yes, yes. If you reckon, we reckon. If&#10;you pay your debts, we pay ours. If you fly, we conquer, and we are&#10;content.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When they had spoken the girl upset the pan, and entered the&#10;opening in the wall, which at once closed, and appeared the same as&#10;before.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When the cook had recovered from her fright she lifted up the&#10;fish which had fallen into the ashes, but she found them as black&#10;as cinders, and not fit to serve up to the Sultan. She began to&#10;cry.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Alas! what shall I say to the Sultan? He will be so angry with&#10;me, and I know he will not believe me!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Whilst she was crying the grand-vizir came in and asked if the&#10;fish were ready. She told him all that had happened, and he was&#10;much surprised. He sent at once for the fisherman, and when he came&#10;said to him, &#34;Fisherman, bring me four more fish like you have&#10;brought already, for an accident has happened to them so that they&#10;cannot be served up to the Sultan.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The fisherman did not say what the genius had told him, but he&#10;excused himself from bringing them that day on account of the&#10;length of the way, and he promised to bring them next day.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In the night he went to the lake, cast his nets, and on drawing&#10;them in found four fish, which were like the others, each of a&#10;different colour.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He went back at once and carried them to the grand-vizir as he&#10;had promised.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He then took them to the kitchen and shut himself up with the&#10;cook, who began to cook them as she had done the four others on the&#10;previous day. When she was about to turn them on the other side,&#10;the wall opened, the damsel appeared, addressed the same words to&#10;the fish, received the same answer, and then overturned the pan and&#10;disappeared.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The grand-vizir was filled with astonishment. &#34;I shall tell the&#10;Sultan all that has happened,&#34; said he. And he did so.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Sultan was very much astounded, and wished to see this&#10;marvel for himself. So he sent for the fisherman, and asked him to&#10;procure four more fish. The fisherman asked for three days, which&#10;were granted, and he then cast his nets in the lake, and again&#10;caught four different coloured fish. The sultan was delighted to&#10;see he had got them, and gave him again four hundred gold&#10;pieces.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As soon as the Sultan had the fish he had them carried to his&#10;room with all that was needed to cook them.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then he shut himself up with the grand-vizir, who began to&#10;prepare them and cook them. When they were done on one side he&#10;turned them over on the other. Then the wall of the room opened,&#10;but instead of the maiden a black slave came out. He was enormously&#10;tall, and carried a large green stick with which he touched the&#10;fish, saying in a terrible voice, &#34;Fish, fish, are you doing your&#10;duty?&#34; To these words the fish lifting up their heads replied,&#10;&#34;Yes, yes. If you reckon, we reckon. If you pay your debts, we pay&#10;ours. If you fly, we conquer, and are content.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The black slave overturned the pan in the middle of the room,&#10;and the fish were turned to cinders. Then he stepped proudly back&#10;into the wall, which closed round him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;After having seen this,&#34; said the Sultan, &#34;I cannot rest. These&#10;fish signify some mystery I must clear up.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He sent for the fisherman. &#34;Fisherman,&#34; he said, &#34;the fish you&#10;have brought us have caused me some anxiety. Where did you get them&#10;from?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Sire,&#34; he answered, &#34;I got them from a lake which lies in the&#10;middle of four hills beyond yonder mountains.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Do you know this lake?&#34; asked the Sultan of the&#10;grand-vizir.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No; though I have hunted many times round that mountain, I have&#10;never heard of it,&#34; said the vizir.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As the fisherman said it was only three hours&#39; journey away, the&#10;sultan ordered his whole court to mount and ride thither, and the&#10;fisherman led them.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;They climbed the mountain, and then, on the other side, saw the&#10;lake as the fisherman had described. The water was so clear that&#10;they could see the four kinds of fish swimming about in it. They&#10;looked at them for some time, and then the Sultan ordered them to&#10;make a camp by the edge of the water.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When night came the Sultan called his vizir, and said to him, &#34;I&#10;have resolved to clear up this mystery. I am going out alone, and&#10;do you stay here in my tent, and when my ministers come to-morrow,&#10;say I am not well, and cannot see them. Do this each day till I&#10;return.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The grand-vizir tried to persuade the Sultan not to go, but in&#10;vain. The Sultan took off his state robe and put on his sword, and&#10;when he saw all was quiet in the camp he set forth alone.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He climbed one of the hills, and then crossed the great plain,&#10;till, just as the sun rose, he beheld far in front of him a large&#10;building. When he came near to it he saw it was a splendid palace&#10;of beautiful black polished marble, covered with steel as smooth as&#10;a mirror.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He went to the gate, which stood half open, and went in, as&#10;nobody came when he knocked. He passed through a magnificent&#10;courtyard and still saw no one, though he called aloud several&#10;times.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He entered large halls where the carpets were of silk, the&#10;lounges and sofas covered with tapestry from Mecca, and the&#10;hangings of the most beautiful Indian stuffs of gold and silver.&#10;Then he found himself in a splendid room, with a fountain supported&#10;by golden lions. The water out of the lions&#39; mouths turned into&#10;diamonds and pearls, and the leaping water almost touched a most&#10;beautifully-painted dome. The palace was surrounded on three sides&#10;by magnificent gardens, little lakes, and woods. Birds sang in the&#10;trees, which were netted over to keep them always there.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Still the Sultan saw no one, till he heard a plaintive cry, and&#10;a voice which said, &#34;Oh that I could die, for I am too unhappy to&#10;wish to live any longer!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Sultan looked round to discover who it was who thus bemoaned&#10;his fate, and at last saw a handsome young man, richly clothed, who&#10;was sitting on a throne raised slightly from the ground. His face&#10;was very sad.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The sultan approached him and bowed to him. The young man bent&#10;his head very low, but did not rise.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Sire,&#34; he said to the Sultan, &#34;I cannot rise and do you the&#10;reverence that I am sure should be paid to your rank.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Sir,&#34; answered the Sultan, &#34;I am sure you have a good reason&#10;for not doing so, and having heard your cry of distress, I am come&#10;to offer you my help. Whose is this palace, and why is it thus&#10;empty?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Instead of answering the young man lifted up his robe, and&#10;showed the Sultan that, from the waist downwards, he was a block of&#10;black marble.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Sultan was horrified, and begged the young man to tell him&#10;his story.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Willingly I will tell you my sad history,&#34; said the young&#10;man.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 3, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/208', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('The Story of the Young King of the Black&#10;Isles'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;You must know, sire, that my father was Mahmoud, the king of&#10;this country, the Black Isles, so called from the four little&#10;mountains which were once islands, while the capital was the place&#10;where now the great lake lies. My story will tell you how these&#10;changes came about.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;My father died when he was sixty-six, and I succeeded him. I&#10;married my cousin, whom I loved tenderly, and I thought she loved&#10;me too.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But one afternoon, when I was half asleep, and was being fanned&#10;by two of her maids, I heard one say to the other, &#34;What a pity it&#10;is that our mistress no longer loves our master! I believe she&#10;would like to kill him if she could, for she is an&#10;enchantress.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I soon found by watching that they were right, and when I&#10;mortally wounded a favourite slave of hers for a great crime, she&#10;begged that she might build a palace in the garden, where she wept&#10;and bewailed him for two years.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At last I begged her to cease grieving for him, for although he&#10;could not speak or move, by her enchantments she just kept him&#10;alive. She turned upon me in a rage, and said over me some magic&#10;words, and I instantly became as you see me now, half man and half&#10;marble.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then this wicked enchantress changed the capital, which was a&#10;very populous and flourishing city, into the lake and desert plain&#10;you saw. The fish of four colours which are in it are the different&#10;races who lived in the town; the four hills are the four islands&#10;which give the name to my kingdom. All this the enchantress told me&#10;to add to my troubles. And this is not all. Every day she comes and&#10;beats me with a whip of buffalo hide.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When the young king had finished his sad story he burst once&#10;more into tears, and the Sultan was much moved.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Tell me,&#34; he cried, &#34;where is this wicked woman, and where is&#10;the miserable object of her affection, whom she just manages to&#10;keep alive?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Where she lives I do not know,&#34; answered the unhappy prince,&#10;&#34;but she goes every day at sunrise to see if the slave can yet&#10;speak to her, after she has beaten me.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Unfortunate king,&#34; said the Sultan, &#34;I will do what I can to&#10;avenge you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So he consulted with the young king over the best way to bring&#10;this about, and they agreed their plan should be put in effect the&#10;next day. The Sultan then rested, and the young king gave himself&#10;up to happy hopes of release. The next day the Sultan arose, and&#10;then went to the palace in the garden where the black slave was. He&#10;drew his sword and destroyed the little life that remained in him,&#10;and then threw the body down a well. He then lay down on the couch&#10;where the slave had been, and waited for the enchantress.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She went first to the young king, whom she beat with a hundred&#10;blows.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then she came to the room where she thought her wounded slave&#10;was, but where the Sultan really lay.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She came near his couch and said, &#34;Are you better to-day, my&#10;dear slave? Speak but one word to me.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;How can I be better,&#34; answered the Sultan, imitating the&#10;language of the Ethiopians, &#34;when I can never sleep for the cries&#10;and groans of your husband?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What joy to hear you speak!&#34; answered the queen. &#34;Do you wish&#10;him to regain his proper shape?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes,&#34; said the Sultan; &#34;hasten to set him at liberty, so that I&#10;may no longer hear his cries.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The queen at once went out and took a cup of water, and said&#10;over it some words that made it boil as if it were on the fire.&#10;Then she threw it over the prince, who at once regained his own&#10;form. He was filled with joy, but the enchantress said, &#34;Hasten&#10;away from this place and never come back, lest I kill you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So he hid himself to see the end of the Sultan&#39;s plan.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The enchantress went back to the Palace of Tears and said, &#34;Now&#10;I have done what you wished.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What you have done,&#34; said the Sultan, &#34;is not enough to cure&#10;me. Every day at midnight all the people whom you have changed into&#10;fish lift their heads out of the lake and cry for vengeance. Go&#10;quickly, and give them their proper shape.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The enchantress hurried away and said some words over the&#10;lake.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The fish then became men, women, and children, and the houses&#10;and shops were once more filled. The Sultan&#39;s suite, who had&#10;encamped by the lake, were not a little astonished to see&#10;themselves in the middle of a large and beautiful town.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As soon as she had disenchanted it the queen went back to the&#10;palace.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Are you quite well now?&#34; she said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Come near,&#34; said the Sultan. &#34;Nearer still.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She obeyed. Then he sprang up, and with one blow of his sword he&#10;cut her in two.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then he went and found the prince.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Rejoice,&#34; he said, &#34;your cruel enemy is dead.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The prince thanked him again and again.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And now,&#34; said the Sultan. &#34;I will go back to my capital, which&#10;I am glad to find is so near yours.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;So near mine!&#34; said the King of the Black Isles.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Do you know it is a whole year&#39;s journey from here? You came&#10;here in a few hours because it was enchanted. But I will accompany&#10;you on your journey.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It will give me much pleasure if you will escort me,&#34; said the&#10;Sultan, &#34;and as I have no children, I will make you my heir.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Sultan and the prince set out together, the Sultan laden&#10;with rich presents from the King of the Black Isles.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The day after he reached his capital the Sultan assembled his&#10;court and told them all that had befallen him, and told them how he&#10;intended to adopt the young king as his heir.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then he gave each man presents in proportion to his rank.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As for the fisherman, as he was the first cause of the&#10;deliverance of the young prince, the Sultan gave him much money,&#10;and made him and his family happy for the rest of their days.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 3, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/208', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('Story of the Three Calenders, Sons of&#10;Kings, and of Five Ladies of Bagdad'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;In the reign of the Caliph Haroun-al-Raschid, there lived at&#10;Bagdad a porter who, in spite of his humble calling, was an&#10;intelligent and sensible man. One morning he was sitting in his&#10;usual place with his basket before him, waiting to be hired, when a&#10;tall young lady, covered with a long muslin veil, came up to him&#10;and said, &#34;Pick up your basket and follow me.&#34; The porter, who was&#10;greatly pleased by her appearance and voice, jumped up at once,&#10;poised his basket on his head, and accompanied the lady, saying to&#10;himself as he went, &#34;Oh, happy day! Oh, lucky meeting!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The lady soon stopped before a closed door, at which she&#10;knocked. It was opened by an old man with a long white beard, to&#10;whom the lady held out money without speaking. The old man, who&#10;seemed to understand what she wanted, vanished into the house, and&#10;returned bringing a large jar of wine, which the porter placed in&#10;his basket. Then the lady signed to him to follow, and they went&#10;their way.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The next place she stopped at was a fruit and flower shop, and&#10;here she bought a large quantity of apples, apricots, peaches, and&#10;other things, with lilies, jasmine, and all sorts of sweet-smelling&#10;plants. From this shop she went to a butcher&#39;s, a grocer&#39;s, and a&#10;poulterer&#39;s, till at last the porter exclaimed in despair, &#34;My good&#10;lady, if you had only told me you were going to buy enough&#10;provisions to stock a town, I would have brought a horse, or rather&#10;a camel.&#34; The lady laughed, and told him she had not finished yet,&#10;but after choosing various kinds of scents and spices from a&#10;druggist&#39;s store, she halted before a magnificent palace, at the&#10;door of which she knocked gently. The porteress who opened it was&#10;of such beauty that the eyes of the man were quite dazzled, and he&#10;was the more astonished as he saw clearly that she was no slave.&#10;The lady who had led him hither stood watching him with amusement,&#10;till the porteress exclaimed, &#34;Why don&#39;t you come in, my sister?&#10;This poor man is so heavily weighed down that he is ready to&#10;drop.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When they were both inside the door was fastened, and they all&#10;three entered a large court, surrounded by an open-work gallery. At&#10;one end of the court was a platform, and on the platform stood an&#10;amber throne supported by four ebony columns, garnished with pearls&#10;and diamonds. In the middle of the court stood a marble basin&#10;filled with water from the mouth of a golden lion.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The porter looked about him, noticing and admiring everything;&#10;but his attention was specially attracted by a third lady sitting&#10;on the throne, who was even more beautiful than the other two. By&#10;the respect shown to her by the others, he judged that she must be&#10;the eldest, and in this he was right. This lady&#39;s name was Zobeida,&#10;the porteress was Sadie, and the housekeeper was Amina. At a word&#10;from Zobeida, Sadie and Amina took the basket from the porter, who&#10;was glad enough to be relieved from its weight; and when it was&#10;emptied, paid him handsomely for its use. But instead of taking up&#10;his basket and going away, the man still lingered, till Zobeida&#10;inquired what he was waiting for, and if he expected more money.&#10;&#34;Oh, madam,&#34; returned he, &#34;you have already given me too much, and&#10;I fear I may have been guilty of rudeness in not taking my&#10;departure at once. But, if you will pardon my saying so, I was lost&#10;in astonishment at seeing such beautiful ladies by themselves. A&#10;company of women without men is, however, as dull as a company of&#10;men without women.&#34; And after telling some stories to prove his&#10;point, he ended by entreating them to let him stay and make a&#10;fourth at their dinner.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The ladies were rather amused at the man&#39;s assurances and after&#10;some discussion it was agreed that he should be allowed to stay, as&#10;his society might prove entertaining. &#34;But listen, friend,&#34; said&#10;Zobeida, &#34;if we grant your request, it is only on condition that&#10;you behave with the utmost politeness, and that you keep the secret&#10;of our way of living, which chance has revealed to you.&#34; Then they&#10;all sat down to table, which had been covered by Amina with the&#10;dishes she had bought.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;After the first few mouthfuls Amina poured some wine into a&#10;golden cup. She first drank herself, according to the Arab custom,&#10;and then filled it for her sisters. When it came to the porter&#39;s&#10;turn he kissed Amina&#39;s hand, and sang a song, which he composed at&#10;the moment in praise of the wine. The three ladies were pleased&#10;with the song, and then sang themselves, so that the repast was a&#10;merry one, and lasted much longer than usual.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At length, seeing that the sun was about to set, Sadia said to&#10;the porter, &#34;Rise and go; it is now time for us to separate.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh, madam,&#34; replied he, &#34;how can you desire me to quit you in&#10;the state in which I am? Between the wine I have drunk, and the&#10;pleasure of seeing you, I should never find the way to my house.&#10;Let me remain here till morning, and when I have recovered my&#10;senses I will go when you like.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Let him stay,&#34; said Amina, who had before proved herself his&#10;friend. &#34;It is only just, as he has given us so much&#10;amusement.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;If you wish it, my sister,&#34; replied Zobeida; &#34;but if he does, I&#10;must make a new condition. Porter,&#34; she continued, turning to him,&#10;&#34;if you remain, you must promise to ask no questions about anything&#10;you may see. If you do, you may perhaps hear what you don&#39;t&#10;like.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;This being settled, Amina brought in supper, and lit up the hall&#10;with a number of sweet smelling tapers. They then sat down again at&#10;the table, and began with fresh appetites to eat, drink, sing, and&#10;recite verses. In fact, they were all enjoying themselves mightily&#10;when they heard a knock at the outer door, which Sadie rose to&#10;open. She soon returned saying that three Calenders, all blind in&#10;the right eye, and all with their heads, faces, and eyebrows clean&#10;shaved, begged for admittance, as they were newly arrived in&#10;Bagdad, and night had already fallen. &#34;They seem to have pleasant&#10;manners,&#34; she added, &#34;but you have no idea how funny they look. I&#10;am sure we should find their company diverting.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Zobeida and Amina made some difficulty about admitting the new&#10;comers, and Sadie knew the reason of their hesitation. But she&#10;urged the matter so strongly that Zobeida was at last forced to&#10;consent. &#34;Bring them in, then,&#34; said she, &#34;but make them understand&#10;that they are not to make remarks about what does not concern them,&#10;and be sure to make them read the inscription over the door.&#34; For&#10;on the door was written in letters of gold, &#34;Whoso meddles in&#10;affairs that are no business of his, will hear truths that will not&#10;please him.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The three Calenders bowed low on entering, and thanked the&#10;ladies for their kindness and hospitality. The ladies replied with&#10;words of welcome, and they were all about to seat themselves when&#10;the eyes of the Calenders fell on the porter, whose dress was not&#10;so very unlike their own, though he still wore all the hair that&#10;nature had given him. &#34;This,&#34; said one of them, &#34;is apparently one&#10;of our Arab brothers, who has rebelled against our ruler.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The porter, although half asleep from the wine he had drunk,&#10;heard the words, and without moving cried angrily to the Calender,&#10;&#34;Sit down and mind your own business. Did you not read the&#10;inscription over the door? Everybody is not obliged to live in the&#10;same way.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Do not be so angry, my good man,&#34; replied the Calender; &#34;we&#10;should be very sorry to displease you;&#34; so the quarrel was smoothed&#10;over, and supper began in good earnest. When the Calenders had&#10;satisfied their hunger, they offered to play to their hostesses, if&#10;there were any instruments in the house. The ladies were delighted&#10;at the idea, and Sadie went to see what she could find, returning&#10;in a few moments laden with two different kinds of flutes and a&#10;tambourine. Each Calender took the one he preferred, and began to&#10;play a well-known air, while the ladies sang the words of the song.&#10;These words were the gayest and liveliest possible, and every now&#10;and then the singers had to stop to indulge the laughter which&#10;almost choked them. In the midst of all their noise, a knock was&#10;heard at the door.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now early that evening the Caliph secretly left the palace,&#10;accompanied by his grand-vizir, Giafar, and Mesrour, chief of the&#10;eunuchs, all three wearing the dresses of merchants. Passing down&#10;the street, the Caliph had been attracted by the music of&#10;instruments and the sound of laughter, and had ordered his vizir to&#10;go and knock at the door of the house, as he wished to enter. The&#10;vizir replied that the ladies who lived there seemed to be&#10;entertaining their friends, and he thought his master would do well&#10;not to intrude on them; but the Caliph had taken it into his head&#10;to see for himself, and insisted on being obeyed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The knock was answered by Sadie, with a taper in her hand, and&#10;the vizir, who was surprised at her beauty, bowed low before her,&#10;and said respectfully, &#34;Madam, we are three merchants who have&#10;lately arrived from Moussoul, and, owing to a misadventure which&#10;befel us this very night, only reached our inn to find that the&#10;doors were closed to us till to-morrow morning. Not knowing what to&#10;do, we wandered in the streets till we happened to pass your house,&#10;when, seeing lights and hearing the sound of voices, we resolved to&#10;ask you to give us shelter till the dawn. If you will grant us this&#10;favour, we will, with your permission, do all in our power to help&#10;you spend the time pleasantly.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Sadie answered the merchant that she must first consult her&#10;sisters; and after having talked over the matter with them, she&#10;returned to tell him that he and his two friends would be welcome&#10;to join their company. They entered and bowed politely to the&#10;ladies and their guests. Then Zobeida, as the mistress, came&#10;forward and said gravely, &#34;You are welcome here, but I hope you&#10;will allow me to beg one thing of you&#8212;have as many eyes as you&#10;like, but no tongues; and ask no questions about anything you see,&#10;however strange it may appear to you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Madam,&#34; returned the vizir, &#34;you shall be obeyed. We have quite&#10;enough to please and interest us without troubling ourselves about&#10;that with which we have no concern.&#34; Then they all sat down, and&#10;drank to the health of the new comers.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;While the vizir, Giafar, was talking to the ladies the Caliph&#10;was occupied in wondering who they could be, and why the three&#10;Calenders had each lost his right eye. He was burning to inquire&#10;the reason of it all, but was silenced by Zobeida&#39;s request, so he&#10;tried to rouse himself and to take his part in the conversation,&#10;which was very lively, the subject of discussion being the many&#10;different sorts of pleasures that there were in the world. After&#10;some time the Calenders got up and performed some curious dances,&#10;which delighted the rest of the company.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When they had finished Zobeida rose from her seat, and, taking&#10;Amina by the hand, she said to her, &#34;My sister, our friends will&#10;excuse us if we seem to forget their presence and fulfil our&#10;nightly task.&#34; Amina understood her sister&#39;s meaning, and&#10;collecting the dishes, glasses, and musical instruments, she&#10;carried them away, while Sadie swept the hall and put everything in&#10;order. Having done this she begged the Calenders to sit on a sofa&#10;on one side of the room, and the Caliph and his friends to place&#10;themselves opposite. As to the porter, she requested him to come&#10;and help her and her sister.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Shortly after Amina entered carrying a seat, which she put down&#10;in the middle of the empty space. She next went over to the door of&#10;a closet and signed to the porter to follow her. He did so, and&#10;soon reappeared leading two black dogs by a chain, which he brought&#10;into the centre of the hall. Zobeida then got up from her seat&#10;between the Calenders and the Caliph and walked slowly across to&#10;where the porter stood with the dogs. &#34;We must do our duty,&#34; she&#10;said with a deep sigh, pushing back her sleeves, and, taking a whip&#10;from Sadie, she said to the man, &#34;Take one of those dogs to my&#10;sister Amina and give me the other.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The porter did as he was bid, but as he led the dog to Zobeida&#10;it uttered piercing howls, and gazed up at her with looks of&#10;entreaty. But Zobeida took no notice, and whipped the dog till she&#10;was out of breath. She then took the chain from the porter, and,&#10;raising the dog on its hind legs, they looked into each other&#39;s&#10;eyes sorrowfully till tears began to fall from both. Then Zobeida&#10;took her handkerchief and wiped the dog&#39;s eyes tenderly, after&#10;which she kissed it, then, putting the chain into the porter&#39;s hand&#10;she said, &#34;Take it back to the closet and bring me the other.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The same ceremony was gone through with the second dog, and all&#10;the while the whole company looked on with astonishment. The Caliph&#10;in particular could hardly contain himself, and made signs to the&#10;vizir to ask what it all meant. But the vizir pretended not to see,&#10;and turned his head away.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Zobeida remained for some time in the middle of the room, till&#10;at last Sadie went up to her and begged her to sit down, as she&#10;also had her part to play. At these words Amina fetched a lute from&#10;a case of yellow satin and gave it to Sadie, who sang several songs&#10;to its accompaniment. When she was tired she said to Amina, &#34;My&#10;sister, I can do no more; come, I pray you, and take my place.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Amina struck a few chords and then broke into a song, which she&#10;sang with so much ardour that she was quite overcome, and sank&#10;gasping on a pile of cushions, tearing open her dress as she did so&#10;to give herself some air. To the amazement of all present, her&#10;neck, instead of being as smooth and white as her face, was a mass&#10;of scars.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Calenders and the Caliph looked at each other, and whispered&#10;together, unheard by Zobeida and Sadie, who were tending their&#10;fainting sister.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What does it all mean? &#39; asked the Caliph.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;We know no more than you,&#34; said the Calender to whom he had&#10;spoken.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What! You do not belong to the house?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My lord,&#34; answered all the Calenders together, &#34;we came here&#10;for the first time an hour before you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;They then turned to the porter to see if he could explain the&#10;mystery, but the porter was no wiser than they were themselves. At&#10;length the Caliph could contain his curiosity no longer, and&#10;declared that he would compel the ladies to tell them the meaning&#10;of their strange conduct. The vizir, foreseeing what would happen,&#10;implored him to remember the condition their hostesses had imposed,&#10;and added in a whisper that if his Highness would only wait till&#10;morning he could as Caliph summon the ladies to appear before him.&#10;But the Caliph, who was not accustomed to be contradicted, rejected&#10;this advice, and it was resolved after a little more talking that&#10;the question should be put by the porter. Suddenly Zobeida turned&#10;round, and seeing their excitement she said, &#34;What is the matter&#8212;&#10;what are you all discussing so earnestly?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Madam,&#34; answered the porter, &#34;these gentlemen entreat you to&#10;explain to them why you should first whip the dogs and then cry&#10;over them, and also how it happens that the fainting lady is&#10;covered with scars. They have requested me, Madam, to be their&#10;mouthpiece.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Is it true, gentlemen,&#34; asked Zobeida, drawing herself up,&#10;&#34;that you have charged this man to put me that question?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It is,&#34; they all replied, except Giafar, who was silent.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Is this,&#34; continued Zobeida, growing more angry every moment,&#10;&#34;is this the return you make for the hospitality I have shown you?&#10;Have you forgotten the one condition on which you were allowed to&#10;enter the house? Come quickly,&#34; she added, clapping her hands three&#10;times, and the words were hardly uttered when seven black slaves,&#10;each armed with a sabre, burst in and stood over the seven men,&#10;throwing them on the ground, and preparing themselves, on a sign&#10;from their mistress, to cut off their heads.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The seven culprits all thought their last hour had come, and the&#10;Caliph repented bitterly that he had not taken the vizir&#39;s advice.&#10;But they made up their minds to die bravely, all except the porter,&#10;who loudly inquired of Zobeida why he was to suffer for other&#10;people&#39;s faults, and declared that these misfortunes would never&#10;have happened if it had not been for the Calenders, who always&#10;brought ill-luck. He ended by imploring Zobeida not to confound the&#10;innocent with the guilty and to spare his life.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In spite of her anger, there was something so comic in the&#10;groans of the porter that Zobeida could not refrain from laughing.&#10;But putting him aside she addressed the others a second time,&#10;saying, &#34;Answer me; who are you? Unless you tell me truly you have&#10;not another moment to live. I can hardly think you are men of any&#10;position, whatever country you belong to. If you were, you would&#10;have had more consideration for us.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Caliph, who was naturally very impatient, suffered far more&#10;than either of the others at feeling that his life was at the mercy&#10;of a justly offended lady, but when he heard her question he began&#10;to breathe more freely, for he was convinced that she had only to&#10;learn his name and rank for all danger to be over. So he whispered&#10;hastily to the vizir, who was next to him, to reveal their secret.&#10;But the vizir, wiser than his master, wished to conceal from the&#10;public the affront they had received, and merely answered, &#34;After&#10;all, we have only got what we deserved.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Meanwhile Zobeida had turned to the three Calenders and inquired&#10;if, as they were all blind, they were brothers.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No, madam,&#34; replied one, &#34;we are no blood relations at all,&#10;only brothers by our mode of life.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And you,&#34; she asked, addressing another, &#34;were you born blind&#10;of one eye?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No, madam,&#34; returned he, &#34;I became blind through a most&#10;surprising adventure, such as probably has never happened to&#10;anybody. After that I shaved my head and eyebrows and put on the&#10;dress in which you see me now.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Zobeida put the same question to the other two Calenders, and&#10;received the same answer.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But,&#34; added the third, &#34;it may interest you, madam, to know&#10;that we are not men of low birth, but are all three sons of kings,&#10;and of kings, too, whom the world holds in high esteem.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At these words Zobeida&#39;s anger cooled down, and she turned to&#10;her slaves and said, &#34;You can give them a little more liberty, but&#10;do not leave the hall. Those that will tell us their histories and&#10;their reasons for coming here shall be allowed to leave unhurt;&#10;those who refuse&#8212;&#34; And she paused, but in a moment the porter, who&#10;understood that he had only to relate his story to set himself free&#10;from this terrible danger, immediately broke in,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Madam, you know already how I came here, and what I have to say&#10;will soon be told. Your sister found me this morning in the place&#10;where I always stand waiting to be hired. She bade me follow her to&#10;various shops, and when my basket was quite full we returned to&#10;this house, when you had the goodness to permit me to remain, for&#10;which I shall be eternally grateful. That is my story.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He looked anxiously to Zobeida, who nodded her head and said,&#10;&#34;You can go; and take care we never meet again.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh, madam,&#34; cried the porter, &#34;let me stay yet a little while.&#10;It is not just that the others should have heard my story and that&#10;I should not hear theirs,&#34; and without waiting for permission he&#10;seated himself on the end of the sofa occupied by the ladies,&#10;whilst the rest crouched on the carpet, and the slaves stood&#10;against the wall.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then one of the Calenders, addressing himself to Zobeida as the&#10;principal lady, began his story.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 3, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/208', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('The Story of the First Calender, Son of a&#10;King'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;In order, madam, to explain how I came to lose my right eye, and&#10;to wear the dress of a Calender, you must first know that I am the&#10;son of a king. My father&#39;s only brother reigned over the&#10;neighbouring country, and had two children, a daughter and a son,&#10;who were of the same age as myself.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As I grew up, and was allowed more liberty, I went every year to&#10;pay a visit to my uncle&#39;s court, and usually stayed there about two&#10;months. In this way my cousin and I became very intimate, and were&#10;much attached to each other. The very last time I saw him he seemed&#10;more delighted to see me than ever, and gave a great feast in my&#10;honour. When we had finished eating, he said to me, &#34;My cousin, you&#10;would never guess what I have been doing since your last visit to&#10;us! Directly after your departure I set a number of men to work on&#10;a building after my own design. It is now completed, and ready to&#10;be lived in. I should like to show it to you, but you must first&#10;swear two things: to be faithful to me, and to keep my secret.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Of course I did not dream of refusing him anything he asked, and&#10;gave the promise without the least hesitation. He then bade me wait&#10;an instant, and vanished, returning in a few moments with a richly&#10;dressed lady of great beauty, but as he did not tell me her name, I&#10;thought it was better not to inquire. We all three sat down to&#10;table and amused ourselves with talking of all sorts of indifferent&#10;things, and with drinking each other&#39;s health. Suddenly the prince&#10;said to me, &#34;Cousin, we have no time to lose; be so kind as to&#10;conduct this lady to a certain spot, where you will find a&#10;dome-like tomb, newly built. You cannot mistake it. Go in, both of&#10;you, and wait till I come. I shall not be long.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As I had promised I prepared to do as I was told, and giving my&#10;hand to the lady, I escorted her, by the light of the moon, to the&#10;place of which the prince had spoken. We had barely reached it when&#10;he joined us himself, carrying a small vessel of water, a pickaxe,&#10;and a little bag containing plaster.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With the pickaxe he at once began to destroy the empty sepulchre&#10;in the middle of the tomb. One by one he took the stones and piled&#10;them up in a corner. When he had knocked down the whole sepulchre&#10;he proceeded to dig at the earth, and beneath where the sepulchre&#10;had been I saw a trap-door. He raised the door and I caught sight&#10;of the top of a spiral staircase; then he said, turning to the&#10;lady, &#34;Madam, this is the way that will lead you down to the spot&#10;which I told you of.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The lady did not answer, but silently descended the staircase,&#10;the prince following her. At the top, however, he looked at me. &#34;My&#10;cousin,&#34; he exclaimed, &#34;I do not know how to thank you for your&#10;kindness. Farewell.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What do you mean?&#34; I cried. &#34;I don&#39;t understand.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No matter,&#34; he replied, &#34;go back by the path that you&#10;came.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He would say no more, and, greatly puzzled, I returned to my&#10;room in the palace and went to bed. When I woke, and considered my&#10;adventure, I thought that I must have been dreaming, and sent a&#10;servant to ask if the prince was dressed and could see me. But on&#10;hearing that he had not slept at home I was much alarmed, and&#10;hastened to the cemetery, where, unluckily, the tombs were all so&#10;alike that I could not discover which was the one I was in search&#10;of, though I spent four days in looking for it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;You must know that all this time the king, my uncle, was absent&#10;on a hunting expedition, and as no one knew when he would be back,&#10;I at last decided to return home, leaving the ministers to make my&#10;excuses. I longed to tell them what had become of the prince, about&#10;whose fate they felt the most dreadful anxiety, but the oath I had&#10;sworn kept me silent.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;On my arrival at my father&#39;s capital, I was astonished to find a&#10;large detachment of guards drawn up before the gate of the palace;&#10;they surrounded me directly I entered. I asked the officers in&#10;command the reason of this strange behaviour, and was horrified to&#10;learn that the army had mutinied and put to death the king, my&#10;father, and had placed the grand-vizir on the throne. Further, that&#10;by his orders I was placed under arrest.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now this rebel vizir had hated me from my boy-hood, because&#10;once, when shooting at a bird with a bow, I had shot out his eye by&#10;accident. Of course I not only sent a servant at once to offer him&#10;my regrets and apologies, but I made them in person. It was all of&#10;no use. He cherished an undying hatred towards me, and lost no&#10;occasion of showing it. Having once got me in his power I felt he&#10;could show no mercy, and I was right. Mad with triumph and fury he&#10;came to me in my prison and tore out my right eye. That is how I&#10;lost it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;My persecutor, however, did not stop here. He shut me up in a&#10;large case and ordered his executioner to carry me into a desert&#10;place, to cut off my head, and then to abandon my body to the birds&#10;of prey. The case, with me inside it, was accordingly placed on a&#10;horse, and the executioner, accompanied by another man, rode into&#10;the country until they found a spot suitable for the purpose. But&#10;their hearts were not so hard as they seemed, and my tears and&#10;prayers made them waver.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Forsake the kingdom instantly,&#34; said the executioner at last,&#10;&#34;and take care never to come back, for you will not only lose your&#10;head, but make us lose ours.&#34; I thanked him gratefully, and tried&#10;to console myself for the loss of my eye by thinking of the other&#10;misfortunes I had escaped.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;After all I had gone through, and my fear of being recognised by&#10;some enemy, I could only travel very slowly and cautiously,&#10;generally resting in some out-of-the-way place by day, and walking&#10;as far as I was able by night, but at length I arrived in the&#10;kingdom of my uncle, of whose protection I was sure.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I found him in great trouble about the disappearance of his son,&#10;who had, he said, vanished without leaving a trace; but his own&#10;grief did not prevent him sharing mine. We mingled our tears, for&#10;the loss of one was the loss of the other, and then I made up my&#10;mind that it was my duty to break the solemn oath I had sworn to&#10;the prince. I therefore lost no time in telling my uncle everything&#10;I knew, and I observed that even before I had ended his sorrow&#10;appeared to be lightened a little.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My dear nephew,&#34; he said, &#34;your story gives me some hope. I was&#10;aware that my son was building a tomb, and I think I can find the&#10;spot. But as he wished to keep the matter secret, let us go alone&#10;and seek the place ourselves.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He then bade me disguise myself, and we both slipped out of a&#10;garden door which opened on to the cemetery. It did not take long&#10;for us to arrive at the scene of the prince&#39;s disappearance, or to&#10;discover the tomb I had sought so vainly before. We entered it, and&#10;found the trap-door which led to the staircase, but we had great&#10;difficulty in raising it, because the prince had fastened it down&#10;underneath with the plaster he had brought with him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;My uncle went first, and I followed him. When we reached the&#10;bottom of the stairs we stepped into a sort of ante-room, filled&#10;with such a dense smoke that it was hardly possible to see&#10;anything. However, we passed through the smoke into a large&#10;chamber, which at first seemed quite empty. The room was&#10;brilliantly lighted, and in another moment we perceived a sort of&#10;platform at one end, on which were the bodies of the prince and a&#10;lady, both half-burned, as if they had been dragged out of a fire&#10;before it had quite consumed them.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;This horrible sight turned me faint, but, to my surprise, my&#10;uncle did not show so much surprise as anger.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I knew,&#34; he said, &#34;that my son was tenderly attached to this&#10;lady, whom it was impossible he should ever marry. I tried to turn&#10;his thoughts, and presented to him the most beautiful princesses,&#10;but he cared for none of them, and, as you see, they have now been&#10;united by a horrible death in an underground tomb.&#34; But, as he&#10;spoke, his anger melted into tears, and again I wept with him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When he recovered himself he drew me to him. &#34;My dear nephew,&#34;&#10;he said, embracing me, &#34;you have come to me to take his place, and&#10;I will do my best to forget that I ever had a son who could act in&#10;so wicked a manner.&#34; Then he turned and went up the stairs.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;We reached the palace without anyone having noticed our absence,&#10;when, shortly after, a clashing of drums, and cymbals, and the&#10;blare of trumpets burst upon our astonished ears. At the same time&#10;a thick cloud of dust on the horizon told of the approach of a&#10;great army. My heart sank when I perceived that the commander was&#10;the vizir who had dethroned my father, and was come to seize the&#10;kingdom of my uncle.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The capital was utterly unprepared to stand a siege, and seeing&#10;that resistance was useless, at once opened its gates. My uncle&#10;fought hard for his life, but was soon overpowered, and when he&#10;fell I managed to escape through a secret passage, and took refuge&#10;with an officer whom I knew I could trust.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Persecuted by ill-fortune, and stricken with grief, there seemed&#10;to be only one means of safety left to me. I shaved my beard and my&#10;eyebrows, and put on the dress of a calender, in which it was easy&#10;for me to travel without being known. I avoided the towns till I&#10;reached the kingdom of the famous and powerful Caliph,&#10;Haroun-al-Raschid, when I had no further reason to fear my enemies.&#10;It was my intention to come to Bagdad and to throw myself at the&#10;feet of his Highness, who would, I felt certain, be touched by my&#10;sad story, and would grant me, besides, his help and&#10;protection.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;After a journey which lasted some months I arrived at length at&#10;the gates of this city. It was sunset, and I paused for a little to&#10;look about me, and to decide which way to turn my steps. I was&#10;still debating on this subject when I was joined by this other&#10;calender, who stopped to greet me. &#34;You, like me, appear to be a&#10;stranger,&#34; I said. He replied that I was right, and before he could&#10;say more the third calender came up. He, also, was newly arrived in&#10;Bagdad, and being brothers in misfortune, we resolved to cast in&#10;our lots together, and to share whatever fate might have in&#10;store.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;By this time it had grown late, and we did not know where to&#10;spend the night. But our lucky star having guided us to this door,&#10;we took the liberty of knocking and of asking for shelter, which&#10;was given to us at once with the best grace in the world.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;This, madam, is my story.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I am satisfied,&#34; replied Zobeida; &#34;you can go when you&#10;like.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The calender, however, begged leave to stay and to hear the&#10;histories of his two friends and of the three other persons of the&#10;company, which he was allowed to do.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 3, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/208', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('The Story of the Second Calendar, Son of&#10;a King'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Madam,&#34; said the young man, addressing Zobeida, &#34;if you wish to&#10;know how I lost my right eye, I shall have to tell you the story of&#10;my whole life.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I was scarcely more than a baby, when the king my father,&#10;finding me unusually quick and clever for my age, turned his&#10;thoughts to my education. I was taught first to read and write, and&#10;then to learn the Koran, which is the basis of our holy religion,&#10;and the better to understand it, I read with my tutors the ablest&#10;commentators on its teaching, and committed to memory all the&#10;traditions respecting the Prophet, which have been gathered from&#10;the mouth of those who were his friends. I also learnt history, and&#10;was instructed in poetry, versification, geography, chronology, and&#10;in all the outdoor exercises in which every prince should excel.&#10;But what I liked best of all was writing Arabic characters, and in&#10;this I soon surpassed my masters, and gained a reputation in this&#10;branch of knowledge that reached as far as India itself.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now the Sultan of the Indies, curious to see a young prince with&#10;such strange tastes, sent an ambassador to my father, laden with&#10;rich presents, and a warm invitation to visit his court. My father,&#10;who was deeply anxious to secure the friendship of so powerful a&#10;monarch, and held besides that a little travel would greatly&#10;improve my manners and open my mind, accepted gladly, and in a&#10;short time I had set out for India with the ambassador, attended&#10;only by a small suite on account of the length of the journey, and&#10;the badness of the roads. However, as was my duty, I took with me&#10;ten camels, laden with rich presents for the Sultan.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;We had been travelling for about a month, when one day we saw a&#10;cloud of dust moving swiftly towards us; and as soon as it came&#10;near, we found that the dust concealed a band of fifty robbers. Our&#10;men barely numbered half, and as we were also hampered by the&#10;camels, there was no use in fighting, so we tried to overawe them&#10;by informing them who we were, and whither we were going. The&#10;robbers, however, only laughed, and declared that was none of their&#10;business, and, without more words, attacked us brutally. I defended&#10;myself to the last, wounded though I was, but at length, seeing&#10;that resistance was hopeless, and that the ambassador and all our&#10;followers were made prisoners, I put spurs to my horse and rode&#10;away as fast as I could, till the poor beast fell dead from a wound&#10;in his side. I managed to jump off without any injury, and looked&#10;about to see if I was pursued. But for the moment I was safe, for,&#10;as I imagined, the robbers were all engaged in quarrelling over&#10;their booty.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I found myself in a country that was quite new to me, and dared&#10;not return to the main road lest I should again fall into the hands&#10;of the robbers. Luckily my wound was only a slight one, and after&#10;binding it up as well as I could, I walked on for the rest of the&#10;day, till I reached a cave at the foot of a mountain, where I&#10;passed the night in peace, making my supper off some fruits I had&#10;gathered on the way.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I wandered about for a whole month without knowing where I was&#10;going, till at length I found myself on the outskirts of a&#10;beautiful city, watered by winding streams, which enjoyed an&#10;eternal spring. My delight at the prospect of mixing once more with&#10;human beings was somewhat damped at the thought of the miserable&#10;object I must seem. My face and hands had been burned nearly black;&#10;my clothes were all in rags, and my shoes were in such a state that&#10;I had been forced to abandon them altogether.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I entered the town, and stopped at a tailor s shop to inquire&#10;where I was. The man saw I was better than my condition, and begged&#10;me to sit down, and in return I told him my whole story. The tailor&#10;listened with attention, but his reply, instead of giving me&#10;consolation, only increased my trouble.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Beware,&#34; he said, &#34;of telling any one what you have told me,&#10;for the prince who governs the kingdom is your father&#39;s greatest&#10;enemy, and he will be rejoiced to find you in his power.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I thanked the tailor for his counsel, and said I would do&#10;whatever he advised; then, being very hungry, I gladly ate of the&#10;food he put before me, and accepted his offer of a lodging in his&#10;house.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In a few days I had quite recovered from the hardships I had&#10;undergone, and then the tailor, knowing that it was the custom for&#10;the princes of our religion to learn a trade or profession so as to&#10;provide for themselves in times of ill-fortune, inquired if there&#10;was anything I could do for my living. I replied that I had been&#10;educated as a grammarian and a poet, but that my great gift was&#10;writing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;All that is of no use here,&#34; said the tailor. &#34;Take my advice,&#10;put on a short coat, and as you seem hardy and strong, go into the&#10;woods and cut firewood, which you will sell in the streets. By this&#10;means you will earn your living, and be able to wait till better&#10;times come. The hatchet and the cord shall be my present.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;This counsel was very distasteful to me, but I thought I could&#10;not do otherwise than adopt it. So the next morning I set out with&#10;a company of poor wood-cutters, to whom the tailor had introduced&#10;me. Even on the first day I cut enough wood to sell for a tolerable&#10;sum, and very soon I became more expert, and had made enough money&#10;to repay the tailor all he had lent me.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I had been a wood-cutter for more than a year, when one day I&#10;wandered further into the forest than I had ever done before, and&#10;reached a delicious green glade, where I began to cut wood. I was&#10;hacking at the root of a tree, when I beheld an iron ring fastened&#10;to a trapdoor of the same metal. I soon cleared away the earth, and&#10;pulling up the door, found a staircase, which I hastily made up my&#10;mind to go down, carrying my hatchet with me by way of protection.&#10;When I reached the bottom I discovered that I was in a huge palace,&#10;as brilliantly lighted as any palace above ground that I had ever&#10;seen, with a long gallery supported by pillars of jasper,&#10;ornamented with capitals of gold. Down this gallery a lady came to&#10;meet me, of such beauty that I forgot everything else, and thought&#10;only of her.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;To save her all the trouble possible, I hastened towards her,&#10;and bowed low.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Who are you? Who are you?&#34; she said. &#34;A man or a genius?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;A man, madam,&#34; I replied; &#34;I have nothing to do with&#10;genii.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;By what accident do you come here?&#34; she asked again with a&#10;sigh. &#34;I have been in this place now for five and twenty years, and&#10;you are the first man who has visited me.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Emboldened by her beauty and gentleness, I ventured to reply,&#10;&#34;Before, madam, I answer your question, allow me to say how&#10;grateful I am for this meeting, which is not only a consolation to&#10;me in my own heavy sorrow, but may perhaps enable me to render your&#10;lot happier,&#34; and then I told her who I was, and how I had come&#10;there.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Alas, prince,&#34; she said, with a deeper sigh than before, &#34;you&#10;have guessed rightly in supposing me an unwilling prisoner in this&#10;gorgeous place. I am the daughter of the king of the Ebony Isle, of&#10;whose fame you surely must have heard. At my father&#39;s desire I was&#10;married to a prince who was my own cousin; but on my very wedding&#10;day, I was snatched up by a genius, and brought here in a faint.&#10;For a long while I did nothing but weep, and would not suffer the&#10;genius to come near me; but time teaches us submission, and I have&#10;now got accustomed to his presence, and if clothes and jewels could&#10;content me, I have them in plenty. Every tenth day, for five and&#10;twenty years, I have received a visit from him, but in case I&#10;should need his help at any other time, I have only to touch a&#10;talisman that stands at the entrance of my chamber. It wants still&#10;five days to his next visit, and I hope that during that time you&#10;will do me the honour to be my guest.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I was too much dazzled by her beauty to dream of refusing her&#10;offer, and accordingly the princess had me conducted to the bath,&#10;and a rich dress befitting my rank was provided for me. Then a&#10;feast of the most delicate dishes was served in a room hung with&#10;embroidered Indian fabrics.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Next day, when we were at dinner, I could maintain my patience&#10;no longer, and implored the princess to break her bonds, and return&#10;with me to the world which was lighted by the sun.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What you ask is impossible,&#34; she answered; &#34;but stay here with&#10;me instead, and we can be happy, and all you will have to do is to&#10;betake yourself to the forest every tenth day, when I am expecting&#10;my master the genius. He is very jealous, as you know, and will not&#10;suffer a man to come near me.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Princess,&#34; I replied, &#34;I see it is only fear of the genius that&#10;makes you act like this. For myself, I dread him so little that I&#10;mean to break his talisman in pieces! Awful though you think him,&#10;he shall feel the weight of my arm, and I herewith take a solemn&#10;vow to stamp out the whole race.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The princess, who realized the consequences of such audacity,&#10;entreated me not to touch the talisman. &#34;If you do, it will be the&#10;ruin of both of us,&#34; said she; &#34;I know genii much better than you.&#34;&#10;But the wine I had drunk had confused my brain; I gave one kick to&#10;the talisman, and it fell into a thousand pieces.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Hardly had my foot touched the talisman when the air became as&#10;dark as night, a fearful noise was heard, and the palace shook to&#10;its very foundations. In an instant I was sobered, and understood&#10;what I had done. &#34;Princess!&#34; I cried, &#34;what is happening?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Alas!&#34; she exclaimed, forgetting all her own terrors in anxiety&#10;for me, &#34;fly, or you are lost.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I followed her advice and dashed up the staircase, leaving my&#10;hatchet behind me. But I was too late. The palace opened and the&#10;genius appeared, who, turning angrily to the princess, asked&#10;indignantly,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What is the matter, that you have sent for me like this?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;A pain in my heart,&#34; she replied hastily, &#34;obliged me to seek&#10;the aid of this little bottle. Feeling faint, I slipped and fell&#10;against the talisman, which broke. That is really all.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You are an impudent liar!&#34; cried the genius. &#34;How did this&#10;hatchet and those shoes get here?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I never saw them before,&#34; she answered, &#34;and you came in such a&#10;hurry that you may have picked them up on the road without knowing&#10;it.&#34; To this the genius only replied by insults and blows. I could&#10;hear the shrieks and groans of the princess, and having by this&#10;time taken off my rich garments and put on those in which I had&#10;arrived the previous day, I lifted the trap, found myself once more&#10;in the forest, and returned to my friend the tailor, with a light&#10;load of wood and a heart full of shame and sorrow.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The tailor, who had been uneasy at my long absence, was,&#10;delighted to see me; but I kept silence about my adventure, and as&#10;soon as possible retired to my room to lament in secret over my&#10;folly. While I was thus indulging my grief my host entered, and&#10;said, &#34;There is an old man downstairs who has brought your hatchet&#10;and slippers, which he picked up on the road, and now restores to&#10;you, as he found out from one of your comrades where you lived. You&#10;had better come down and speak to him yourself.&#34; At this speech I&#10;changed colour, and my legs trembled under me. The tailor noticed&#10;my confusion, and was just going to inquire the reason when the&#10;door of the room opened, and the old man appeared, carrying with&#10;him my hatchet and shoes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I am a genius,&#34; he said, &#34;the son of the daughter of Eblis,&#10;prince of the genii. Is not this hatchet yours, and these shoes?&#34;&#10;Without waiting for an answer&#8212;which, indeed, I could hardly have&#10;given him, so great was my fright&#8212;he seized hold of me, and darted&#10;up into the air with the quickness of lightning, and then, with&#10;equal swiftness, dropped down towards the earth. When he touched&#10;the ground, he rapped it with his foot; it opened, and we found&#10;ourselves in the enchanted palace, in the presence of the beautiful&#10;princess of the Ebony Isle. But how different she looked from what&#10;she was when I had last seen her, for she was lying stretched on&#10;the ground covered with blood, and weeping bitterly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Traitress!&#34; cried the genius, &#34;is not this man your lover?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She lifted up her eyes slowly, and looked sadly at me. &#34;I never&#10;saw him before,&#34; she answered slowly. &#34;I do not know who he&#10;is.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What!&#34; exclaimed the genius, &#34;you owe all your sufferings to&#10;him, and yet you dare to say he is a stranger to you!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But if he really is a stranger to me,&#34; she replied, &#34;why should&#10;I tell a lie and cause his death?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Very well,&#34; said the genius, drawing his sword, &#34;take this, and&#10;cut off his head.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Alas,&#34; answered the princess, &#34;I am too weak even to hold the&#10;sabre. And supposing that I had the strength, why should I put an&#10;innocent man to death?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You condemn yourself by your refusal,&#34; said the genius; then&#10;turning to me, he added, &#34;and you, do you not know her?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;How should I?&#34; I replied, resolved to imitate the princess in&#10;her fidelity. &#34;How should I, when I never saw her before?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Cut her head off,&#34; then, &#34;if she is a stranger to you, and I&#10;shall believe you are speaking the truth, and will set you at&#10;liberty.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Certainly,&#34; I answered, taking the sabre in my hands, and&#10;making a sign to the princess to fear nothing, as it was my own&#10;life that I was about to sacrifice, and not hers. But the look of&#10;gratitude she gave me shook my courage, and I flung the sabre to&#10;the earth.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I should not deserve to live,&#34; I said to the genius, &#34;if I were&#10;such a coward as to slay a lady who is not only unknown to me, but&#10;who is at this moment half dead herself. Do with me as you will&#8212; I&#10;am in your power&#8212;but I refuse to obey your cruel command.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I see,&#34; said the genius, &#34;that you have both made up your minds&#10;to brave me, but I will give you a sample of what you may expect.&#34;&#10;So saying, with one sweep of his sabre he cut off a hand of the&#10;princess, who was just able to lift the other to wave me an eternal&#10;farewell. Then I lost consciousness for several minutes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When I came to myself I implored the genius to keep me no longer&#10;in this state of suspense, but to lose no time in putting an end to&#10;my sufferings. The genius, however, paid no attention to my&#10;prayers, but said sternly, &#34;That is the way in which a genius&#10;treats the woman who has betrayed him. If I chose, I could kill you&#10;also; but I will be merciful, and content myself with changing you&#10;into a dog, an ass, a lion, or a bird&#8212;whichever you prefer.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I caught eagerly at these words, as giving me a faint hope of&#10;softening his wrath. &#34;O genius!&#34; I cried, &#34;as you wish to spare my&#10;life, be generous, and spare it altogether. Grant my prayer, and&#10;pardon my crime, as the best man in the whole world forgave his&#10;neighbour who was eaten up with envy of him.&#34; Contrary to my hopes,&#10;the genius seemed interested in my words, and said he would like to&#10;hear the story of the two neighbours; and as I think, madam, it may&#10;please you, I will tell it to you also.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 3, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/208', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('The Story of the Envious Man and of Him&#10;Who Was Envied'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;In a town of moderate size, two men lived in neighbouring&#10;houses; but they had not been there very long before one man took&#10;such a hatred of the other, and envied him so bitterly, that the&#10;poor man determined to find another home, hoping that when they no&#10;longer met every day his enemy would forget all about him. So he&#10;sold his house and the little furniture it contained, and moved&#10;into the capital of the country, which was luckily at no great&#10;distance. About half a mile from this city he bought a nice little&#10;place, with a large garden and a fair-sized court, in the centre of&#10;which stood an old well.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In order to live a quieter life, the good man put on the robe of&#10;a dervish, and divided his house into a quantity of small cells,&#10;where he soon established a number of other dervishes. The fame of&#10;his virtue gradually spread abroad, and many people, including&#10;several of the highest quality, came to visit him and ask his&#10;prayers.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Of course it was not long before his reputation reached the ears&#10;of the man who envied him, and this wicked wretch resolved never to&#10;rest till he had in some way worked ill to the dervish whom he&#10;hated. So he left his house and his business to look after&#10;themselves, and betook himself to the new dervish monastery, where&#10;he was welcomed by the founder with all the warmth imaginable. The&#10;excuse he gave for his appearance was that he had come to consult&#10;the chief of the dervishes on a private matter of great importance.&#10;&#34;What I have to say must not be overheard,&#34; he whispered; &#34;command,&#10;I beg of you, that your dervishes retire into their cells, as night&#10;is approaching, and meet me in the court.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The dervish did as he was asked without delay, and directly they&#10;were alone together the envious man began to tell a long story,&#10;edging, as they walked to and fro, always nearer to the well, and&#10;when they were quite close, he seized the dervish and dropped him&#10;in. He then ran off triumphantly, without having been seen by&#10;anyone, and congratulating himself that the object of his hatred&#10;was dead, and would trouble him no more.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But in this he was mistaken! The old well had long been&#10;inhabited (unknown to mere human beings) by a set of fairies and&#10;genii, who caught the dervish as he fell, so that he received no&#10;hurt. The dervish himself could see nothing, but he took for&#10;granted that something strange had happened, or he must certainly&#10;have been dashed against the side of the well and been killed. He&#10;lay quite still, and in a moment he heard a voice saying, &#34;Can you&#10;guess whom this man is that we have saved from death?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No,&#34; replied several other voices.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And the first speaker answered, &#34;I will tell you. This man, from&#10;pure goodness of heart, forsook the town where he lived and came to&#10;dwell here, in the hope of curing one of his neighbours of the envy&#10;he felt towards him. But his character soon won him the esteem of&#10;all, and the envious man&#39;s hatred grew, till he came here with the&#10;deliberate intention of causing his death. And this he would have&#10;done, without our help, the very day before the Sultan has arranged&#10;to visit this holy dervish, and to entreat his prayers for the&#10;princess, his daughter.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But what is the matter with the princess that she needs the&#10;dervish&#39;s prayers?&#34; asked another voice.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;She has fallen into the power of the genius Maimoum, the son of&#10;Dimdim,&#34; replied the first voice. &#34;But it would be quite simple for&#10;this holy chief of the dervishes to cure her if he only knew! In&#10;his convent there is a black cat which has a tiny white tip to its&#10;tail. Now to cure the princess the dervish must pull out seven of&#10;these white hairs, burn three, and with their smoke perfume the&#10;head of the princess. This will deliver her so completely that&#10;Maimoum, the son of Dimdim, will never dare to approach her&#10;again.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The fairies and genii ceased talking, but the dervish did not&#10;forget a word of all they had said; and when morning came he&#10;perceived a place in the side of the well which was broken, and&#10;where he could easily climb out.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The dervishes, who could not imagine what had become of him,&#10;were enchanted at his reappearance. He told them of the attempt on&#10;his life made by his guest of the previous day, and then retired&#10;into his cell. He was soon joined here by the black cat of which&#10;the voice had spoken, who came as usual to say good-morning to his&#10;master. He took him on his knee and seized the opportunity to pull&#10;seven white hairs out of his tail, and put them on one side till&#10;they were needed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The sun had not long risen before the Sultan, who was anxious to&#10;leave nothing undone that might deliver the princess, arrived with&#10;a large suite at the gate of the monastery, and was received by the&#10;dervishes with profound respect. The Sultan lost no time in&#10;declaring the object of his visit, and leading the chief of the&#10;dervishes aside, he said to him, &#34;Noble scheik, you have guessed&#10;perhaps what I have come to ask you?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, sire,&#34; answered the dervish; &#34;if I am not mistaken, it is&#10;the illness of the princess which has procured me this honour.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You are right,&#34; returned the Sultan, &#34;and you will give me&#10;fresh life if you can by your prayers deliver my daughter from the&#10;strange malady that has taken possession of her.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Let your highness command her to come here, and I will see what&#10;I can do.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Sultan, full of hope, sent orders at once that the princess&#10;was to set out as soon as possible, accompanied by her usual staff&#10;of attendants. When she arrived, she was so thickly veiled that the&#10;dervish could not see her face, but he desired a brazier to be held&#10;over her head, and laid the seven hairs on the burning coals. The&#10;instant they were consumed, terrific cries were heard, but no one&#10;could tell from whom they proceeded. Only the dervish guessed that&#10;they were uttered by Maimoum the son of Dimdim, who felt the&#10;princess escaping him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;All this time she had seemed unconscious of what she was doing,&#10;but now she raised her hand to her veil and uncovered her face.&#10;&#34;Where am I?&#34; she said in a bewildered manner; &#34;and how did I get&#10;here?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Sultan was so delighted to hear these words that he not only&#10;embraced his daughter, but kissed the hand of the dervish. Then,&#10;turning to his attendants who stood round, he said to them, &#34;What&#10;reward shall I give to the man who has restored me my&#10;daughter?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;They all replied with one accord that he deserved the hand of&#10;the princess.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That is my own opinion,&#34; said he, &#34;and from this moment I&#10;declare him to be my son-in-law.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Shortly after these events, the grand-vizir died, and his post&#10;was given to the dervish. But he did not hold it for long, for the&#10;Sultan fell a victim to an attack of illness, and as he had no&#10;sons, the soldiers and priests declared the dervish heir to the&#10;throne, to the great joy of all the people.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;One day, when the dervish, who had now become Sultan, was making&#10;a royal progress with his court, he perceived the envious man&#10;standing in the crowd. He made a sign to one of his vizirs, and&#10;whispered in his ear, &#34;Fetch me that man who is standing out there,&#10;but take great care not to frighten him.&#34; The vizir obeyed, and&#10;when the envious man was brought before the Sultan, the monarch&#10;said to him, &#34;My friend, I am delighted to see you again.&#34; Then&#10;turning to an officer, he added, &#34;Give him a thousand pieces of&#10;gold out of my treasury, and twenty waggon-loads of merchandise out&#10;of my private stores, and let an escort of soldiers accompany him&#10;home.&#34; He then took leave of the envious man, and went on his&#10;way.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now when I had ended my story, I proceeded to show the genius&#10;how to apply it to himself. &#34;O genius,&#34; I said, &#34;you see that this&#10;Sultan was not content with merely forgiving the envious man for&#10;the attempt on his life; he heaped rewards and riches upon&#10;him.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But the genius had made up his mind, and could not be softened.&#10;&#34;Do not imagine that you are going to escape so easily,&#34; he said.&#10;&#34;All I can do is to give you bare life; you will have to learn what&#10;happens to people who interfere with me.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As he spoke he seized me violently by the arm; the roof of the&#10;palace opened to make way for us, and we mounted up so high into&#10;the air that the earth looked like a little cloud. Then, as before,&#10;he came down with the swiftness of lightning, and we touched the&#10;ground on a mountain top.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then he stooped and gathered a handful of earth, and murmured&#10;some words over it, after which he threw the earth in my face,&#10;saying as he did so, &#34;Quit the form of a man, and assume that of a&#10;monkey.&#34; This done, he vanished, and I was in the likeness of an&#10;ape, and in a country I had never seen before.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;However there was no use in stopping where I was, so I came down&#10;the mountain and found myself in a flat plain which was bounded by&#10;the sea. I travelled towards it, and was pleased to see a vessel&#10;moored about half a mile from shore. There were no waves, so I&#10;broke off the branch of a tree, and dragging it down to the waters&#10;edge, sat across it, while, using two sticks for oars, I rowed&#10;myself towards the ship.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The deck was full of people, who watched my progress with&#10;interest, but when I seized a rope and swung myself on board, I&#10;found that I had only escaped death at the hands of the genius to&#10;perish by those of the sailors, lest I should bring ill-luck to the&#10;vessel and the merchants. &#34;Throw him into the sea!&#34; cried one.&#10;&#34;Knock him on the head with a hammer,&#34; exclaimed another. &#34;Let me&#10;shoot him with an arrow,&#34; said a third; and certainly somebody&#10;would have had his way if I had not flung myself at the captain&#39;s&#10;feet and grasped tight hold of his dress. He appeared touched by my&#10;action and patted my head, and declared that he would take me under&#10;his protection, and that no one should do me any harm.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At the end of about fifty days we cast anchor before a large&#10;town, and the ship was immediately surrounded by a multitude of&#10;small boats filled with people, who had come either to meet their&#10;friends or from simple curiosity. Among others, one boat contained&#10;several officials, who asked to see the merchants on board, and&#10;informed them that they had been sent by the Sultan in token of&#10;welcome, and to beg them each to write a few lines on a roll of&#10;paper. &#34;In order to explain this strange request,&#34; continued the&#10;officers, &#34;it is necessary that you should know that the&#10;grand-vizir, lately dead, was celebrated for his beautiful&#10;handwriting, and the Sultan is anxious to find a similar talent in&#10;his successor. Hitherto the search has been a failure, but his&#10;Highness has not yet given up hope.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;One after another the merchants set down a few lines upon the&#10;roll, and when they had all finished, I came forward, and snatched&#10;the paper from the man who held it. At first they all thought I was&#10;going to throw it into the sea, but they were quieted when they saw&#10;I held it with great care, and great was their surprise when I made&#10;signs that I too wished to write something.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Let him do it if he wants to,&#34; said the captain. &#34;If he only&#10;makes a mess of the paper, you may be sure I will punish him for&#10;it. But if, as I hope, he really can write, for he is the cleverest&#10;monkey I ever saw, I will adopt him as my son. The one I lost had&#10;not nearly so much sense!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;No more was said, and I took the pen and wrote the six sorts of&#10;writing in use among the Arabs, and each sort contained an original&#10;verse or couplet, in praise of the Sultan. And not only did my&#10;handwriting completely eclipse that of the merchants, but it is&#10;hardly too much to say that none so beautiful had ever before been&#10;seen in that country. When I had ended the officials took the roll&#10;and returned to the Sultan.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As soon as the monarch saw my writing he did not so much as look&#10;at the samples of the merchants, but desired his officials to take&#10;the finest and most richly caparisoned horse in his stables,&#10;together with the most magnificent dress they could procure, and to&#10;put it on the person who had written those lines, and bring him to&#10;court.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The officials began to laugh when they heard the Sultan&#39;s&#10;command, but as soon as they could speak they said, &#34;Deign, your&#10;highness, to excuse our mirth, but those lines were not written by&#10;a man but by a monkey.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;A monkey!&#34; exclaimed the Sultan.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, sire,&#34; answered the officials. &#34;They were written by a&#10;monkey in our presence.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Then bring me the monkey,&#34; he replied, &#34;as fast as you&#10;can.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Sultan&#39;s officials returned to the ship and showed the royal&#10;order to the captain.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;He is the master,&#34; said the good man, and desired that I should&#10;be sent for.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then they put on me the gorgeous robe and rowed me to land,&#10;where I was placed on the horse and led to the palace. Here the&#10;Sultan was awaiting me in great state surrounded by his court.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;All the way along the streets I had been the object of curiosity&#10;to a vast crowd, which had filled every doorway and every window,&#10;and it was amidst their shouts and cheers that I was ushered into&#10;the presence of the Sultan.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I approached the throne on which he was seated and made him&#10;three low bows, then prostrated myself at his feet to the surprise&#10;of everyone, who could not understand how it was possible that a&#10;monkey should be able to distinguish a Sultan from other people,&#10;and to pay him the respect due to his rank. However, excepting the&#10;usual speech, I omitted none of the common forms attending a royal&#10;audience.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When it was over the Sultan dismissed all the court, keeping&#10;with him only the chief of the eunuchs and a little slave. He then&#10;passed into another room and ordered food to be brought, making&#10;signs to me to sit at table with him and eat. I rose from my seat,&#10;kissed the ground, and took my place at the table, eating, as you&#10;may suppose, with care and in moderation.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Before the dishes were removed I made signs that writing&#10;materials, which stood in one corner of the room, should be laid in&#10;front of me. I then took a peach and wrote on it some verses in&#10;praise of the Sultan, who was speechless with astonishment; but&#10;when I did the same thing on a glass from which I had drunk he&#10;murmured to himself, &#34;Why, a man who could do as much would be&#10;cleverer than any other man, and this is only a monkey!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Supper being over chessmen were brought, and the Sultan signed&#10;to me to know if I would play with him. I kissed the ground and&#10;laid my hand on my head to show that I was ready to show myself&#10;worthy of the honour. He beat me the first game, but I won the&#10;second and third, and seeing that this did not quite please I&#10;dashed off a verse by way of consolation.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Sultan was so enchanted with all the talents of which I had&#10;given proof that he wished me to exhibit some of them to other&#10;people. So turning to the chief of the eunuchs he said, &#34;Go and beg&#10;my daughter, Queen of Beauty, to come here. I will show her&#10;something she has never seen before.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The chief of the eunuchs bowed and left the room, ushering in a&#10;few moments later the princess, Queen of Beauty. Her face was&#10;uncovered, but the moment she set foot in the room she threw her&#10;veil over her head. &#34;Sire,&#34; she said to her father, &#34;what can you&#10;be thinking of to summon me like this into the presence of a&#10;man?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I do not understand you,&#34; replied the Sultan. &#34;There is nobody&#10;here but the eunuch, who is your own servant, the little slave, and&#10;myself, yet you cover yourself with your veil and reproach me for&#10;having sent for you, as if I had committed a crime.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Sire,&#34; answered the princess, &#34;I am right and you are wrong.&#10;This monkey is really no monkey at all, but a young prince who has&#10;been turned into a monkey by the wicked spells of a genius, son of&#10;the daughter of Eblis.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As will be imagined, these words took the Sultan by surprise,&#10;and he looked at me to see how I should take the statement of the&#10;princess. As I was unable to speak, I placed my hand on my head to&#10;show that it was true.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But how do you know this, my daughter?&#34; asked he.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Sire,&#34; replied Queen of Beauty, &#34;the old lady who took care of&#10;me in my childhood was an accomplished magician, and she taught me&#10;seventy rules of her art, by means of which I could, in the&#10;twinkling of an eye, transplant your capital into the middle of the&#10;ocean. Her art likewise teaches me to recognise at first sight all&#10;persons who are enchanted, and tells me by whom the spell was&#10;wrought.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My daughter,&#34; said the Sultan, &#34;I really had no idea you were&#10;so clever.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Sire,&#34; replied the princess, &#34;there are many out-of-the-way&#10;things it is as well to know, but one should never boast of&#10;them.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well,&#34; asked the Sultan, &#34;can you tell me what must be done to&#10;disenchant the young prince?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Certainly; and I can do it.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Then restore him to his former shape,&#34; cried the Sultan. &#34;You&#10;could give me no greater pleasure, for I wish to make him my&#10;grand-vizir, and to give him to you for your husband.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;As your Highness pleases,&#34; replied the princess.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Queen of Beauty rose and went to her chamber, from which she&#10;fetched a knife with some Hebrew words engraven on the blade. She&#10;then desired the Sultan, the chief of the eunuchs, the little&#10;slave, and myself to descend into a secret court of the palace, and&#10;placed us beneath a gallery which ran all round, she herself&#10;standing in the centre of the court. Here she traced a large circle&#10;and in it wrote several words in Arab characters.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When the circle and the writing were finished she stood in the&#10;middle of it and repeated some verses from the Koran. Slowly the&#10;air grew dark, and we felt as if the earth was about to crumble&#10;away, and our fright was by no means diminished at seeing the&#10;genius, son of the daughter of Eblis, suddenly appear under the&#10;form of a colossal lion.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Dog,&#34; cried the princess when she first caught sight of him,&#10;&#34;you think to strike terror into me by daring to present yourself&#10;before me in this hideous shape.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And you,&#34; retorted the lion, &#34;have not feared to break our&#10;treaty that engaged solemnly we should never interfere with each&#10;other.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Accursed genius!&#34; exclaimed the princess, &#34;it is you by whom&#10;that treaty was first broken.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I will teach you how to give me so much trouble,&#34; said the&#10;lion, and opening his huge mouth he advanced to swallow her. But&#10;the princess expected something of the sort and was on her guard.&#10;She bounded on one side, and seizing one of the hairs of his mane&#10;repeated two or three words over it. In an instant it became a&#10;sword, and with a sharp blow she cut the lion&#39;s body into two&#10;pieces. These pieces vanished no one knew where, and only the&#10;lion&#39;s head remained, which was at once changed into a scorpion.&#10;Quick as thought the princess assumed the form of a serpent and&#10;gave battle to the scorpion, who, finding he was getting the worst&#10;of it, turned himself into an eagle and took flight. But in a&#10;moment the serpent had become an eagle more powerful still, who&#10;soared up in the air and after him, and then we lost sight of them&#10;both.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;We all remained where we were quaking with anxiety, when the&#10;ground opened in front of us and a black and white cat leapt out,&#10;its hair standing on end, and miauing frightfully. At its heels was&#10;a wolf, who had almost seized it, when the cat changed itself into&#10;a worm, and, piercing the skin of a pomegranate which had tumbled&#10;from a tree, hid itself in the fruit. The pomegranate swelled till&#10;it grew as large as a pumpkin, and raised itself on to the roof of&#10;the gallery, from which it fell into the court and was broken into&#10;bits. While this was taking place the wolf, who had transformed&#10;himself into a cock, began to swallow the seed of the pomegranate&#10;as fast as he could. When all were gone he flew towards us,&#10;flapping his wings as if to ask if we saw any more, when suddenly&#10;his eye fell on one which lay on the bank of the little canal that&#10;flowed through the court; he hastened towards it, but before he&#10;could touch it the seed rolled into the canal and became a fish.&#10;The cock flung himself in after the fish and took the shape of a&#10;pike, and for two hours they chased each other up and down under&#10;the water, uttering horrible cries, but we could see nothing. At&#10;length they rose from the water in their proper forms, but darting&#10;such flames of fire from their mouths that we dreaded lest the&#10;palace should catch fire. Soon, however, we had much greater cause&#10;for alarm, as the genius, having shaken off the princess, flew&#10;towards us. Our fate would have been sealed if the princess, seeing&#10;our danger, had not attracted the attention of the genius to&#10;herself. As it was, the Sultan&#39;s beard was singed and his face&#10;scorched, the chief of the eunuchs was burned to a cinder, while a&#10;spark deprived me of the sight of one eye. Both I and the Sultan&#10;had given up all hope of a rescue, when there was a shout of&#10;&#34;Victory, victory!&#34; from the princess, and the genius lay at her&#10;feet a great heap of ashes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Exhausted though she was, the princess at once ordered the&#10;little slave, who alone was uninjured, to bring her a cup of water,&#10;which she took in her hand. First repeating some magic words over&#10;it, she dashed it into my face saying, &#34;If you are only a monkey by&#10;enchantment, resume the form of the man you were before.&#34; In an&#10;instant I stood before her the same man I had formerly been, though&#10;having lost the sight of one eye.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I was about to fall on my knees and thank the princess but she&#10;did not give me time. Turning to the Sultan, her father, she said,&#10;&#34;Sire, I have gained the battle, but it has cost me dear. The fire&#10;has penetrated to my heart, and I have only a few moments to live.&#10;This would not have happened if I had only noticed the last&#10;pomegranate seed and eaten it like the rest. It was the last&#10;struggle of the genius, and up to that time I was quite safe. But&#10;having let this chance slip I was forced to resort to fire, and in&#10;spite of all his experience I showed the genius that I knew more&#10;than he did. He is dead and in ashes, but my own death is&#10;approaching fast.&#34; &#34;My daughter,&#34; cried the Sultan, &#34;how sad is my&#10;condition! I am only surprised I am alive at all! The eunuch is&#10;consumed by the flames, and the prince whom you have delivered has&#10;lost the sight of one eye.&#34; He could say no more, for sobs choked&#10;his voice, and we all wept together.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Suddenly the princess shrieked, &#34;I burn, I burn!&#34; and death came&#10;to free her from her torments.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I have no words, madam, to tell you of my feelings at this&#10;terrible sight. I would rather have remained a monkey all my life&#10;than let my benefactress perish in this shocking manner. As for the&#10;Sultan, he was quite inconsolable, and his subjects, who had dearly&#10;loved the princess, shared his grief. For seven days the whole&#10;nation mourned, and then the ashes of the princess were buried with&#10;great pomp, and a superb tomb was raised over her.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As soon as the Sultan recovered from the severe illness which&#10;had seized him after the death of the princess he sent for me and&#10;plainly, though politely, informed me that my presence would always&#10;remind him of his loss, and he begged that I would instantly quit&#10;his kingdom, and on pain of death never return to it. I was, of&#10;course, bound to obey, and not knowing what was to become of me I&#10;shaved my beard and eyebrows and put on the dress of a calender.&#10;After wandering aimlessly through several countries, I resolved to&#10;come to Bagdad and request an audience of the Commander of the&#10;Faithful.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And that, madam, is my story.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The other Calender then told his story.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 3, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/208', :deleted => 0)

It was fate that deprived them of the sight of&#10;their right eyes, but mine was lost by my own folly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;My name is Agib, and I am the son of a king called Cassib, who&#10;reigned over a large kingdom, which had for its capital one of the&#10;finest seaport towns in the world.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When I succeeded to my father&#39;s throne my first care was to&#10;visit the provinces on the mainland, and then to sail to the&#10;numerous islands which lay off the shore, in order to gain the&#10;hearts of my subjects. These voyages gave me such a taste for&#10;sailing that I soon determined to explore more distant seas, and&#10;commanded a fleet of large ships to be got ready without delay.&#10;When they were properly fitted out I embarked on my expedition.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For forty days wind and weather were all in our favour, but the&#10;next night a terrific storm arose, which blew us hither and thither&#10;for ten days, till the pilot confessed that he had quite lost his&#10;bearings. Accordingly a sailor was sent up to the masthead to try&#10;to catch a sight of land, and reported that nothing was to be seen&#10;but the sea and sky, except a huge mass of blackness that lay&#10;astern.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;On hearing this the pilot grew white, and, beating his breast,&#10;he cried, &#34;Oh, sir, we are lost, lost!&#34; till the ship&#39;s crew&#10;trembled at they knew not what. When he had recovered himself a&#10;little, and was able to explain the cause of his terror, he&#10;replied, in answer to my question, that we had drifted far out of&#10;our course, and that the following day about noon we should come&#10;near that mass of darkness, which, said he, is nothing but the&#10;famous Black Mountain. This mountain is composed of adamant, which&#10;attracts to itself all the iron and nails in your ship; and as we&#10;are helplessly drawn nearer, the force of attraction will become so&#10;great that the iron and nails will fall out of the ships and cling&#10;to the mountain, and the ships will sink to the bottom with all&#10;that are in them. This it is that causes the side of the mountain&#10;towards the sea to appear of such a dense blackness.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As may be supposed&#8212;continued the pilot&#8212;the mountain sides are&#10;very rugged, but on the summit stands a brass dome supported on&#10;pillars, and bearing on top the figure of a brass horse, with a&#10;rider on his back. This rider wears a breastplate of lead, on which&#10;strange signs and figures are engraved, and it is said that as long&#10;as this statue remains on the dome, vessels will never cease to&#10;perish at the foot of the mountain.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So saying, the pilot began to weep afresh, and the crew, fearing&#10;their last hour had come, made their wills, each one in favour of&#10;his fellow.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At noon next day, as the pilot had foretold, we were so near to&#10;the Black Mountain that we saw all the nails and iron fly out of&#10;the ships and dash themselves against the mountain with a horrible&#10;noise. A moment after the vessels fell asunder and sank, the crews&#10;with them. I alone managed to grasp a floating plank, and was&#10;driven ashore by the wind, without even a scratch. What was my joy&#10;on finding myself at the bottom of some steps which led straight up&#10;the mountain, for there was not another inch to the right or the&#10;left where a man could set his foot. And, indeed, even the steps&#10;themselves were so narrow and so steep that, if the lightest breeze&#10;had arisen, I should certainly have been blown into the sea.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When I reached the top I found the brass dome and the statue&#10;exactly as the pilot had described, but was too wearied with all I&#10;had gone through to do more than glance at them, and, flinging&#10;myself under the dome, was asleep in an instant. In my dreams an&#10;old man appeared to me and said, &#34;Hearken, Agib! As soon as thou&#10;art awake dig up the ground underfoot, and thou shalt find a bow of&#10;brass and three arrows of lead. Shoot the arrows at the statue, and&#10;the rider shall tumble into the sea, but the horse will fall down&#10;by thy side, and thou shalt bury him in the place from which thou&#10;tookest the bow and arrows. This being done the sea will rise and&#10;cover the mountain, and on it thou wilt perceive the figure of a&#10;metal man seated in a boat, having an oar in each hand. Step on&#10;board and let him conduct thee; but if thou wouldest behold thy&#10;kingdom again, see that thou takest not the name of Allah into thy&#10;mouth.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Having uttered these words the vision left me, and I woke, much&#10;comforted. I sprang up and drew the bow and arrows out of the&#10;ground, and with the third shot the horseman fell with a great&#10;crash into the sea, which instantly began to rise, so rapidly, that&#10;I had hardly time to bury the horse before the boat approached me.&#10;I stepped silently in and sat down, and the metal man pushed off,&#10;and rowed without stopping for nine days, after which land appeared&#10;on the horizon. I was so overcome with joy at this sight that I&#10;forgot all the old man had told me, and cried out, &#34;Allah be&#10;praised! Allah be praised!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The words were scarcely out of my mouth when the boat and man&#10;sank from beneath me, and left me floating on the surface. All that&#10;day and the next night I swam and floated alternately, making as&#10;well as I could for the land which was nearest to me. At last my&#10;strength began to fail, and I gave myself up for lost, when the&#10;wind suddenly rose, and a huge wave cast me on a flat shore. Then,&#10;placing myself in safety, I hastily spread my clothes out to dry in&#10;the sun, and flung myself on the warm ground to rest.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Next morning I dressed myself and began to look about me. There&#10;seemed to be no one but myself on the island, which was covered&#10;with fruit trees and watered with streams, but seemed a long&#10;distance from the mainland which I hoped to reach. Before, however,&#10;I had time to feel cast down, I saw a ship making directly for the&#10;island, and not knowing whether it would contain friends or foes, I&#10;hid myself in the thick branches of a tree.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The sailors ran the ship into a creek, where ten slaves landed,&#10;carrying spades and pickaxes. In the middle of the island they&#10;stopped, and after digging some time, lifted up what seemed to be a&#10;trapdoor. They then returned to the vessel two or three times for&#10;furniture and provisions, and finally were accompanied by an old&#10;man, leading a handsome boy of fourteen or fifteen years of age.&#10;They all disappeared down the trapdoor, and after remaining below&#10;for a few minutes came up again, but without the boy, and let down&#10;the trapdoor, covering it with earth as before. This done, they&#10;entered the ship and set sail.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As soon as they were out of sight, I came down from my tree, and&#10;went to the place where the boy had been buried. I dug up the earth&#10;till I reached a large stone with a ring in the centre. This, when&#10;removed, disclosed a flight of stone steps which led to a large&#10;room richly furnished and lighted by tapers. On a pile of cushions,&#10;covered with tapestry, sat the boy. He looked up, startled and&#10;frightened at the sight of a stranger in such a place, and to&#10;soothe his fears, I at once spoke: &#34;Be not alarmed, sir, whoever&#10;you may be. I am a king, and the son of a king, and will do you no&#10;hurt. On the contrary, perhaps I have been sent here to deliver you&#10;out of this tomb, where you have been buried alive.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Hearing my words, the young man recovered himself, and when I&#10;had ended, he said, &#34;The reasons, Prince, that have caused me to be&#10;buried in this place are so strange that they cannot but surprise&#10;you. My father is a rich merchant, owning much land and many ships,&#10;and has great dealings in precious stones, but he never ceased&#10;mourning that he had no child to inherit his wealth.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;At length one day he dreamed that the following year a son&#10;would be born to him, and when this actually happened, he consulted&#10;all the wise men in the kingdom as to the future of the infant. One&#10;and all they said the same thing. I was to live happily till I was&#10;fifteen, when a terrible danger awaited me, which I should hardly&#10;escape. If, however, I should succeed in doing so, I should live to&#10;a great old age. And, they added, when the statue of the brass&#10;horse on the top of the mountain of adamant is thrown into the sea&#10;by Agib, the son of Cassib, then beware, for fifty days later your&#10;son shall fall by his hand!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;This prophecy struck the heart of my father with such woe, that&#10;he never got over it, but that did not prevent him from attending&#10;carefully to my education till I attained, a short time ago, my&#10;fifteenth birthday. It was only yesterday that the news reached him&#10;that ten days previously the statue of brass had been thrown into&#10;the sea, and he at once set about hiding me in this underground&#10;chamber, which was built for the purpose, promising to fetch me out&#10;when the forty days have passed. For myself, I have no fears, as&#10;Prince Agib is not likely to come here to look for me.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I listened to his story with an inward laugh as to the absurdity&#10;of my ever wishing to cause the death of this harmless boy, whom I&#10;hastened to assure of my friendship and even of my protection;&#10;begging him, in return, to convey me in his father&#39;s ship to my own&#10;country. I need hardly say that I took special care not to inform&#10;him that I was the Agib whom he dreaded.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The day passed in conversation on various subjects, and I found&#10;him a youth of ready wit and of some learning. I took on myself the&#10;duties of a servant, held the basin and water for him when he&#10;washed, prepared the dinner and set it on the table. He soon grew&#10;to love me, and for thirty-nine days we spent as pleasant an&#10;existence as could be expected underground.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The morning of the fortieth dawned, and the young man when he&#10;woke gave thanks in an outburst of joy that the danger was passed.&#10;&#34;My father may be here at any moment,&#34; said he, &#34;so make me, I pray&#10;you, a bath of hot water, that I may bathe, and change my clothes,&#10;and be ready to receive him.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So I fetched the water as he asked, and washed and rubbed him,&#10;after which he lay down again and slept a little. When he opened&#10;his eyes for the second time, he begged me to bring him a melon and&#10;some sugar, that he might eat and refresh himself.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I soon chose a fine melon out of those which remained, but could&#10;find no knife to cut it with. &#34;Look in the cornice over my head,&#34;&#10;said he, &#34;and I think you will see one.&#34; It was so high above me,&#10;that I had some difficulty in reaching it, and catching my foot in&#10;the covering of the bed, I slipped, and fell right upon the young&#10;man, the knife going straight into his heart.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At this awful sight I shrieked aloud in my grief and pain. I&#10;threw myself on the ground and rent my clothes and tore my hair&#10;with sorrow. Then, fearing to be punished as his murderer by the&#10;unhappy father, I raised the great stone which blocked the&#10;staircase, and quitting the underground chamber, made everything&#10;fast as before.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Scarcely had I finished when, looking out to sea, I saw the&#10;vessel heading for the island, and, feeling that it would be&#10;useless for me to protest my innocence, I again concealed myself&#10;among the branches of a tree that grew near by.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The old man and his slaves pushed off in a boat directly the&#10;ship touched land, and walked quickly towards the entrance to the&#10;underground chamber; but when they were near enough to see that the&#10;earth had been disturbed, they paused and changed colour. In&#10;silence they all went down and called to the youth by name; then&#10;for a moment I heard no more. Suddenly a fearful scream rent the&#10;air, and the next instant the slaves came up the steps, carrying&#10;with them the body of the old man, who had fainted from sorrow!&#10;Laying him down at the foot of the tree in which I had taken&#10;shelter, they did their best to recover him, but it took a long&#10;while. When at last he revived, they left him to dig a grave, and&#10;then laying the young man&#39;s body in it, they threw in the&#10;earth.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;This ended, the slaves brought up all the furniture that&#10;remained below, and put it on the vessel, and breaking some boughs&#10;to weave a litter, they laid the old man on it, and carried him to&#10;the ship, which spread its sails and stood out to sea.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So once more I was quite alone, and for a whole month I walked&#10;daily over the island, seeking for some chance of escape. At length&#10;one day it struck me that my prison had grown much larger, and that&#10;the mainland seemed to be nearer. My heart beat at this thought,&#10;which was almost too good to be true. I watched a little longer:&#10;there was no doubt about it, and soon there was only a tiny stream&#10;for me to cross.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Even when I was safe on the other side I had a long distance to&#10;go on the mud and sand before I reached dry ground, and very tired&#10;I was, when far in front of me I caught sight of a castle of red&#10;copper, which, at first sight, I took to be a fire. I made all the&#10;haste I could, and after some miles of hard walking stood before&#10;it, and gazed at it in astonishment, for it seemed to me the most&#10;wonderful building I had ever beheld. While I was still staring at&#10;it, there came towards me a tall old man, accompanied by ten young&#10;men, all handsome, and all blind of the right eye.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now in its way, the spectacle of ten men walking together, all&#10;blind of the right eye, is as uncommon as that of a copper castle,&#10;and I was turning over in my mind what could be the meaning of this&#10;strange fact, when they greeted me warmly, and inquired what had&#10;brought me there. I replied that my story was somewhat long, but&#10;that if they would take the trouble to sit down, I should be happy&#10;to tell it them. When I had finished, the young men begged that I&#10;would go with them to the castle, and I joyfully accepted their&#10;offer. We passed through what seemed to me an endless number of&#10;rooms, and came at length into a large hall, furnished with ten&#10;small blue sofas for the ten young men, which served as beds as&#10;well as chairs, and with another sofa in the middle for the old&#10;man. As none of the sofas could hold more than one person, they&#10;bade me place myself on the carpet, and to ask no questions about&#10;anything I should see.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;After a little while the old man rose and brought in supper,&#10;which I ate heartily, for I was very hungry. Then one of the young&#10;men begged me to repeat my story, which had struck them all with&#10;astonishment, and when I had ended, the old man was bidden to &#34;do&#10;his duty,&#34; as it was late, and they wished to go to bed. At these&#10;words he rose, and went to a closet, from which he brought out ten&#10;basins, all covered with blue stuff. He set one before each of the&#10;young men, together with a lighted taper.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When the covers were taken off the basins, I saw they were&#10;filled with ashes, coal-dust, and lamp-black. The young men mixed&#10;these all together, and smeared the whole over their heads and&#10;faces. They then wept and beat their breasts, crying, &#34;This is the&#10;fruit of idleness, and of our wicked lives.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;This ceremony lasted nearly the whole night, and when it stopped&#10;they washed themselves carefully, and put on fresh clothes, and lay&#10;down to sleep.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;All this while I had refrained from questions, though my&#10;curiosity almost seemed to burn a hole in me, but the following&#10;day, when we went out to walk, I said to them, &#34;Gentlemen, I must&#10;disobey your wishes, for I can keep silence no more. You do not&#10;appear to lack wit, yet you do such actions as none but madmen&#10;could be capable of. Whatever befalls me I cannot forbear asking,&#10;`Why you daub your faces with black, and how it is you are all&#10;blind of one eye?&#39;&#34; But they only answered that such questions were&#10;none of my business, and that I should do well to hold my&#10;peace.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;During that day we spoke of other things, but when night came,&#10;and the same ceremony was repeated, I implored them most earnestly&#10;to let me know the meaning of it all.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It is for your own sake,&#34; replied one of the young men, &#34;that&#10;we have not granted your request, and to preserve you from our&#10;unfortunate fate. If, however, you wish to share our destiny we&#10;will delay no longer.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I answered that whatever might be the consequence I wished to&#10;have my curiosity satisfied, and that I would take the result on my&#10;own head. He then assured me that, even when I had lost my eye, I&#10;should be unable to remain with them, as their number was complete,&#10;and could not be added to. But to this I replied that, though I&#10;should be grieved to part company with such honest gentlemen, I&#10;would not be turned from my resolution on that account.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;On hearing my determination my ten hosts then took a sheep and&#10;killed it, and handed me a knife, which they said I should&#10;by-and-by find useful. &#34;We must sew you into this sheep-skin,&#34; said&#10;they, &#34;and then leave you. A fowl of monstrous size, called a roc,&#10;will appear in the air, taking you to be a sheep. He will snatch&#10;you up and carry you into the sky, but be not alarmed, for he will&#10;bring you safely down and lay you on the top of a mountain. When&#10;you are on the ground cut the skin with the knife and throw it off.&#10;As soon as the roc sees you he will fly away from fear, but you&#10;must walk on till you come to a castle covered with plates of gold,&#10;studded with jewels. Enter boldly at the gate, which always stands&#10;open, but do not ask us to tell you what we saw or what befel us&#10;there, for that you will learn for yourself. This only we may say,&#10;that it cost us each our right eye, and has imposed upon us our&#10;nightly penance.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;After the young gentlemen had been at the trouble of sewing the&#10;sheep-skin on me they left me, and retired to the hall. In a few&#10;minutes the roc appeared, and bore me off to the top of the&#10;mountain in his huge claws as lightly as if I had been a feather,&#10;for this great white bird is so strong that he has been known to&#10;carry even an elephant to his nest in the hills.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The moment my feet touched the ground I took out my knife and&#10;cut the threads that bound me, and the sight of me in my proper&#10;clothes so alarmed the roc that he spread his wings and flew away.&#10;Then I set out to seek the castle.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I found it after wandering about for half a day, and never could&#10;I have imagined anything so glorious. The gate led into a square&#10;court, into which opened a hundred doors, ninety-nine of them being&#10;of rare woods and one of gold. Through each of these doors I caught&#10;glimpses of splendid gardens or of rich storehouses.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Entering one of the doors which was standing open I found myself&#10;in a vast hall where forty young ladies, magnificently dressed, and&#10;of perfect beauty, were reclining. As soon as they saw me they rose&#10;and uttered words of welcome, and even forced me to take possession&#10;of a seat that was higher than their own, though my proper place&#10;was at their feet. Not content with this, one brought me splendid&#10;garments, while another filled a basin with scented water and&#10;poured it over my hands, and the rest busied themselves with&#10;preparing refreshments. After I had eaten and drunk of the most&#10;delicate food and rarest wines, the ladies crowded round me and&#10;begged me to tell them all my adventures.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;By the time I had finished night had fallen, and the ladies&#10;lighted up the castle with such a prodigious quantity of tapers&#10;that even day could hardly have been brighter. We then sat down to&#10;a supper of dried fruits and sweetmeats, after which some sang and&#10;others danced. I was so well amused that I did not notice how the&#10;time was passing, but at length one of the ladies approached and&#10;informed me it was midnight, and that, as I must be tired, she&#10;would conduct me to the room that had been prepared for me. Then,&#10;bidding me good-night, I was left to sleep.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I spent the next thirty-nine days in much the same way as the&#10;first, but at the close of that time the ladies appeared (as was&#10;their custom) in my room one morning to inquire how I had slept,&#10;and instead of looking cheerful and smiling they were in floods of&#10;tears. &#34;Prince,&#34; said they, &#34;we must leave you, and never was it so&#10;hard to part from any of our friends. Most likely we shall never&#10;see you again, but if you have sufficient self-command perhaps we&#10;may yet look forward to a meeting.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ladies,&#34; I replied, &#34;what is the meaning of these strange&#10;words&#8212; I pray you to tell me?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Know then,&#34; answered one of them, &#34;that we are all princesses&#8212;&#10;each a king&#39;s daughter. We live in this castle together, in the way&#10;that you have seen, but at the end of every year secret duties call&#10;us away for the space of forty days. The time has now come; but&#10;before we depart, we will leave you our keys, so that you may not&#10;lack entertainment during our absence. But one thing we would ask&#10;of you. The Golden Door, alone, forbear to open, as you value your&#10;own peace, and the happiness of your life. That door once unlocked,&#10;we must bid you farewell for ever.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Weeping, I assured them of my prudence, and after embracing me&#10;tenderly, they went their ways.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Every day I opened two or three fresh doors, each of which&#10;contained behind it so many curious things that I had no chance of&#10;feeling dull, much as I regretted the absence of the ladies.&#10;Sometimes it was an orchard, whose fruit far exceeded in bigness&#10;any that grew in my father&#39;s garden. Sometimes it was a court&#10;planted with roses, jessamine, dafeodils, hyacinths and anemones,&#10;and a thousand other flowers of which I did not know the names. Or&#10;again, it would be an aviary, fitted with all kinds of singing&#10;birds, or a treasury heaped up with precious stones; but whatever I&#10;might see, all was perfect of its own sort.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Thirty-nine days passed away more rapidly than I could have&#10;conceived possible, and the following morning the princesses were&#10;to return to the castle. But alas! I had explored every corner,&#10;save only the room that was shut in by the Golden Door, and I had&#10;no longer anything to amuse myself with. I stood before the&#10;forbidden place for some time, gazing at its beauty; then a happy&#10;inspiration struck me, that because I unlocked the door it was not&#10;necessary that I should enter the chamber. It would be enough for&#10;me to stand outside and view whatever hidden wonders might be&#10;therein.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Thus arguing against my own conscience, I turned the key, when a&#10;smell rushed out that, pleasant though it was, overcame me&#10;completely, and I fell fainting across the threshold. Instead of&#10;being warned by this accident, directly I came to myself I went for&#10;a few moments into the air to shake of the effects of the perfume,&#10;and then entered boldly. I found myself in a large, vaulted room,&#10;lighted by tapers, scented with aloes and ambergris, standing in&#10;golden candle-sticks, whilst gold and silver lamps hung from the&#10;ceiling.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Though objects of rare workmanship lay heaped around me, I paid&#10;them scant attention, so much was I struck by a great black horse&#10;which stood in one corner, the handsomest and best-shaped animal I&#10;had ever seen. His saddle and bridle were of massive gold,&#10;curiously wrought; one side of his trough was filled with clean&#10;barley and sesame, and the other with rose water. I led the animal&#10;into the open air, and then jumped on his back, shaking the reins&#10;as I did so, but as he never stirred, I touched him lightly with a&#10;switch I had picked up in his stable. No sooner did he feel the&#10;stroke, than he spread his wings (which I had not perceived&#10;before), and flew up with me straight into the sky. When he had&#10;reached a prodigious height, he next darted back to earth, and&#10;alighted on the terrace belonging to a castle, shaking me violently&#10;out of the saddle as he did so, and giving me such a blow with his&#10;tail, that he knocked out my right eye.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Half-stunned as I was with all that had happened to me, I rose&#10;to my feet, thinking as I did so of what had befallen the ten young&#10;men, and watching the horse which was soaring into the clouds. I&#10;left the terrace and wandered on till I came to a hall, which I&#10;knew to have been the one from which the roc had taken me, by the&#10;ten blue sofas against the wall.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The ten young men were not present when I first entered, but&#10;came in soon after, accompanied by the old man. They greeted me&#10;kindly, and bewailed my misfortune, though, indeed, they had&#10;expected nothing less. &#34;All that has happened to you,&#34; they said,&#10;&#34;we also have undergone, and we should be enjoying the same&#10;happiness still, had we not opened the Golden Door while the&#10;princesses were absent. You have been no wiser than we, and have&#10;suffered the same punishment. We would gladly receive you among us,&#10;to perform such penance as we do, but we have already told you that&#10;this is impossible. Depart, therefore, from hence and go to the&#10;Court of Bagdad, where you shall meet with him that can decide your&#10;destiny.&#34; They told me the way I was to travel, and I left&#10;them.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;On the road I caused my beard and eyebrows to be shaved, and put&#10;on a Calender&#39;s habit. I have had a long journey, but arrived this&#10;evening in the city, where I met my brother Calenders at the gate,&#10;being strangers like myself. We wondered much at one another, to&#10;see we were all blind of the same eye, but we had no leisure to&#10;discourse at length of our common calamities. We had only so much&#10;time as to come hither to implore those favours which you have been&#10;generously pleased to grant us.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He finished, and it was Zobeida&#39;s turn to speak: &#34;Go wherever&#10;you please,&#34; she said, addressing all three. &#34;I pardon you all, but&#10;you must depart immediately out of this house.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 3, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/208', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('The Seven Voyages of Sindbad the&#10;Sailor'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;IN the times of the Caliph Haroun-al-Raschid there lived in&#10;Bagdad a poor porter named Hindbad, who on a very hot day was sent&#10;to carry a heavy load from one end of the city to the other. Before&#10;he had accomplished half the distance he was so tired that, finding&#10;himself in a quiet street where the pavement was sprinkled with&#10;rose water, and a cool breeze was blowing, he set his burden upon&#10;the ground, and sat down to rest in the shade of a grand house.&#10;Very soon he decided that he could not have chosen a pleasanter&#10;place; a delicious perfume of aloes wood and pastilles came from&#10;the open windows and mingled with the scent of the rose water which&#10;steamed up from the hot pavement. Within the palace he heard some&#10;music, as of many instruments cunningly played, and the melodious&#10;warble of nightingales and other birds, and by this, and the&#10;appetising smell of many dainty dishes of which he presently became&#10;aware, he judged that feasting and merry making were going on. He&#10;wondered who lived in this magnificent house which he had never&#10;seen before, the street in which it stood being one which he seldom&#10;had occasion to pass. To satisfy his curiosity he went up to some&#10;splendidly dressed servants who stood at the door, and asked one of&#10;them the name of the master of the mansion.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What,&#34; replied he, &#34;do you live in Bagdad, and not know that&#10;here lives the noble Sindbad the Sailor, that famous traveller who&#10;sailed over every sea upon which the sun shines?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The porter, who had often heard people speak of the immense&#10;wealth of Sindbad, could not help feeling envious of one whose lot&#10;seemed to be as happy as his own was miserable. Casting his eyes up&#10;to the sky he exclaimed aloud,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Consider, Mighty Creator of all things, the differences between&#10;Sindbad&#39;s life and mine. Every day I suffer a thousand hardships&#10;and misfortunes, and have hard work to get even enough bad barley&#10;bread to keep myself and my family alive, while the lucky Sindbad&#10;spends money right and left and lives upon the fat of the land!&#10;What has he done that you should give him this pleasant life&#8212; what&#10;have I done to deserve so hard a fate?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So saying he stamped upon the ground like one beside himself&#10;with misery and despair. Just at this moment a servant came out of&#10;the palace, and taking him by the arm said, &#34;Come with me, the&#10;noble Sindbad, my master, wishes to speak to you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Hindbad was not a little surprised at this summons, and feared&#10;that his unguarded words might have drawn upon him the displeasure&#10;of Sindbad, so he tried to excuse himself upon the pretext that he&#10;could not leave the burden which had been entrusted to him in the&#10;street. However the lackey promised him that it should be taken&#10;care of, and urged him to obey the call so pressingly that at last&#10;the porter was obliged to yield.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He followed the servant into a vast room, where a great company&#10;was seated round a table covered with all sorts of delicacies. In&#10;the place of honour sat a tall, grave man whose long white beard&#10;gave him a venerable air. Behind his chair stood a crowd of&#10;attendants eager to minister to his wants. This was the famous&#10;Sindbad himself. The porter, more than ever alarmed at the sight of&#10;so much magnificence, tremblingly saluted the noble company.&#10;Sindbad, making a sign to him to approach, caused him to be seated&#10;at his right hand, and himself heaped choice morsels upon his&#10;plate, and poured out for him a draught of excellent wine, and&#10;presently, when the banquet drew to a close, spoke to him&#10;familiarly, asking his name and occupation.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My lord,&#34; replied the porter, &#34;I am called Hindbad.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I am glad to see you here,&#34; continued Sindbad. &#34;And I will&#10;answer for the rest of the company that they are equally pleased,&#10;but I wish you to tell me what it was that you said just now in the&#10;street.&#34; For Sindbad, passing by the open window before the feast&#10;began, had heard his complaint and therefore had sent for him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At this question Hindbad was covered with confusion, and hanging&#10;down his head, replied, &#34;My lord, I confess that, overcome by&#10;weariness and ill-humour, I uttered indiscreet words, which I pray&#10;you to pardon me.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh!&#34; replied Sindbad, &#34;do not imagine that I am so unjust as to&#10;blame you. On the contrary, I understand your situation and can&#10;pity you. Only you appear to be mistaken about me, and I wish to&#10;set you right. You doubtless imagine that I have acquired all the&#10;wealth and luxury that you see me enjoy without difficulty or&#10;danger, but this is far indeed from being the case. I have only&#10;reached this happy state after having for years suffered every&#10;possible kind of toil and danger.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes, my noble friends,&#34; he continued, addressing the company,&#10;&#34;l assure you that my adventures have been strange enough to deter&#10;even the most avaricious men from seeking wealth by traversing the&#10;seas. Since you have, perhaps, heard but confused accounts of my&#10;seven voyages, and the dangers and wonders that I have met with by&#10;sea and land, I will now give you a full and true account of them,&#10;which I think you will be well pleased to hear.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As Sindbad was relating his adventures chiefly on account of the&#10;porter, he ordered, before beginning his tale, that the burden&#10;which had been left in the street should be carried by some of his&#10;own servants to the place for which Hindbad had set out at first,&#10;while he remained to listen to the story.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 3, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/208', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('First Voyage'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;I had inherited considerable wealth from my parents, and being&#10;young and foolish I at first squandered it recklessly upon every&#10;kind of pleasure, but presently, finding that riches speedily take&#10;to themselves wings if managed as badly as I was managing mine, and&#10;remembering also that to be old and poor is misery indeed, I began&#10;to bethink me of how I could make the best of what still remained&#10;to me. I sold all my household goods by public auction, and joined&#10;a company of merchants who traded by sea, embarking with them at&#10;Balsora in a ship which we had fitted out between us.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;We set sail and took our course towards the East Indies by the&#10;Persian Gulf, having the coast of Persia upon our left hand and&#10;upon our right the shores of Arabia Felix. I was at first much&#10;troubled by the uneasy motion of the vessel, but speedily recovered&#10;my health, and since that hour have been no more plagued by&#10;sea-sickness.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;From time to time we landed at various islands, where we sold or&#10;exchanged our merchandise, and one day, when the wind dropped&#10;suddenly, we found ourselves becalmed close to a small island like&#10;a green meadow, which only rose slightly above the surface of the&#10;water. Our sails were furled, and the captain gave permission to&#10;all who wished to land for a while and amuse themselves. I was&#10;among the number, but when after strolling about for some time we&#10;lighted a fire and sat down to enjoy the repast which we had&#10;brought with us, we were startled by a sudden and violent trembling&#10;of the island, while at the same moment those left upon the ship&#10;set up an outcry bidding us come on board for our lives, since what&#10;we had taken for an island was nothing but the back of a sleeping&#10;whale. Those who were nearest to the boat threw themselves into it,&#10;others sprang into the sea, but before I could save myself the&#10;whale plunged suddenly into the depths of the ocean, leaving me&#10;clinging to a piece of the wood which we had brought to make our&#10;fire. Meanwhile a breeze had sprung up, and in the confusion that&#10;ensued on board our vessel in hoisting the sails and taking up&#10;those who were in the boat and clinging to its sides, no one missed&#10;me and I was left at the mercy of the waves. All that day I floated&#10;up and down, now beaten this way, now that, and when night fell I&#10;despaired for my life; but, weary and spent as I was, I clung to my&#10;frail support, and great was my joy when the morning light showed&#10;me that I had drifted against an island.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The cliffs were high and steep, but luckily for me some&#10;tree-roots protruded in places, and by their aid I climbed up at&#10;last, and stretched myself upon the turf at the top, where I lay,&#10;more dead than alive, till the sun was high in the heavens. By that&#10;time I was very hungry, but after some searching I came upon some&#10;eatable herbs, and a spring of clear water, and much refreshed I&#10;set out to explore the island. Presently I reached a great plain&#10;where a grazing horse was tethered, and as I stood looking at it I&#10;heard voices talking apparently underground, and in a moment a man&#10;appeared who asked me how I came upon the island. I told him my&#10;adventures, and heard in return that he was one of the grooms of&#10;Mihrage, the king of the island, and that each year they came to&#10;feed their master&#39;s horses in this plain. He took me to a cave&#10;where his companions were assembled, and when I had eaten of the&#10;food they set before me, they bade me think myself fortunate to&#10;have come upon them when I did, since they were going back to their&#10;master on the morrow, and without their aid I could certainly never&#10;have found my way to the inhabited part of the island.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Early the next morning we accordingly set out, and when we&#10;reached the capital I was graciously received by the king, to whom&#10;I related my adventures, upon which he ordered that I should be&#10;well cared for and provided with such things as I needed. Being a&#10;merchant I sought out men of my own profession, and particularly&#10;those who came from foreign countries, as I hoped in this way to&#10;hear news from Bagdad, and find out some means of returning&#10;thither, for the capital was situated upon the sea-shore, and&#10;visited by vessels from all parts of the world. In the meantime I&#10;heard many curious things, and answered many questions concerning&#10;my own country, for I talked willingly with all who came to me.&#10;Also to while away the time of waiting I explored a little island&#10;named Cassel, which belonged to King Mihrage, and which was&#10;supposed to be inhabited by a spirit named Deggial. Indeed, the&#10;sailors assured me that often at night the playing of timbals could&#10;be heard upon it. However, I saw nothing strange upon my voyage,&#10;saving some fish that were full two hundred cubits long, but were&#10;fortunately more in dread of us than even we were of them, and fled&#10;from us if we did but strike upon a board to frighten them. Other&#10;fishes there were only a cubit long which had heads like owls.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;One day after my return, as I went down to the quay, I saw a&#10;ship which had just cast anchor, and was discharging her cargo,&#10;while the merchants to whom it belonged were busily directing the&#10;removal of it to their warehouses. Drawing nearer I presently&#10;noticed that my own name was marked upon some of the packages, and&#10;after having carefully examined them, I felt sure that they were&#10;indeed those which I had put on board our ship at Balsora. I then&#10;recognised the captain of the vessel, but as I was certain that he&#10;believed me to be dead, I went up to him and asked who owned the&#10;packages that I was looking at.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;There was on board my ship,&#34; he replied, &#34;a merchant of Bagdad&#10;named Sindbad. One day he and several of my other passengers landed&#10;upon what we supposed to be an island, but which was really an&#10;enormous whale floating asleep upon the waves. No sooner did it&#10;feel upon its back the heat of the fire which had been kindled,&#10;than it plunged into the depths of the sea. Several of the people&#10;who were upon it perished in the waters, and among others this&#10;unlucky Sindbad. This merchandise is his, but I have resolved to&#10;dispose of it for the benefit of his family if I should ever chance&#10;to meet with them.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Captain,&#34; said I, &#34;I am that Sindbad whom you believe to be&#10;dead, and these are my possessions!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When the captain heard these words he cried out in amazement,&#10;&#34;Lackaday! and what is the world coming to? In these days there is&#10;not an honest man to be met with. Did I not with my own eyes see&#10;Sindbad drown, and now you have the audacity to tell me that you&#10;are he! I should have taken you to be a just man, and yet for the&#10;sake of obtaining that which does not belong to you, you are ready&#10;to invent this horrible falsehood.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Have patience, and do me the favour to hear my story,&#34; said&#10;I.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Speak then,&#34; replied the captain, &#34;I&#39;m all attention.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So I told him of my escape and of my fortunate meeting with the&#10;king&#39;s grooms, and how kindly I had been received at the palace.&#10;Very soon I began to see that I had made some impression upon him,&#10;and after the arrival of some of the other merchants, who showed&#10;great joy at once more seeing me alive, he declared that he also&#10;recognised me.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Throwing himself upon my neck he exclaimed, &#34;Heaven be praised&#10;that you have escaped from so great a danger. As to your goods, I&#10;pray you take them, and dispose of them as you please.&#34; I thanked&#10;him, and praised his honesty, begging him to accept several bales&#10;of merchandise in token of my gratitude, but he would take nothing.&#10;Of the choicest of my goods I prepared a present for King Mihrage,&#10;who was at first amazed, having known that I had lost my all.&#10;However, when I had explained to him how my bales had been&#10;miraculously restored to me, he graciously accepted my gifts, and&#10;in return gave me many valuable things. I then took leave of him,&#10;and exchanging my merchandise for sandal and aloes wood, camphor,&#10;nutmegs, cloves, pepper, and ginger, I embarked upon the same&#10;vessel and traded so successfully upon our homeward voyage that I&#10;arrived in Balsora with about one hundred thousand sequins. My&#10;family received me with as much joy as I felt upon seeing them once&#10;more. I bought land and slaves, and built a great house in which I&#10;resolved to live happily, and in the enjoyment of all the pleasures&#10;of life to forget my past sufferings.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Here Sindbad paused, and commanded the musicians to play again,&#10;while the feasting continued until evening. When the time came for&#10;the porter to depart, Sindbad gave him a purse containing one&#10;hundred sequins, saying, &#34;Take this, Hindbad, and go home, but&#10;to-morrow come again and you shall hear more of my adventures.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The porter retired quite overcome by so much generosity, and you&#10;may imagine that he was well received at home, where his wife and&#10;children thanked their lucky stars that he had found such a&#10;benefactor.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The next day Hindbad, dressed in his best, returned to the&#10;voyager&#39;s house, and was received with open arms. As soon as all&#10;the guests had arrived the banquet began as before, and when they&#10;had feasted long and merrily, Sindbad addressed them thus:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My friends, I beg that you will give me your attention while I&#10;relate the adventures of my second voyage, which you will find even&#10;more astonishing than the first.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 3, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/208', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('Second Voyage'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;I had resolved, as you know, on my return from my first voyage,&#10;to spend the rest of my days quietly in Bagdad, but very soon I&#10;grew tired of such an idle life and longed once more to find myself&#10;upon the sea.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I procured, therefore, such goods as were suitable for the&#10;places I intended to visit, and embarked for the second time in a&#10;good ship with other merchants whom I knew to be honourable men. We&#10;went from island to island, often making excellent bargains, until&#10;one day we landed at a spot which, though covered with fruit trees&#10;and abounding in springs of excellent water, appeared to possess&#10;neither houses nor people. While my companions wandered here and&#10;there gathering flowers and fruit I sat down in a shady place, and,&#10;having heartily enjoyed the provisions and the wine I had brought&#10;with me, I fell asleep, lulled by the murmur of a clear brook which&#10;flowed close by.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;How long I slept I know not, but when I opened my eyes and&#10;started to my feet I perceived with horror that I was alone and&#10;that the ship was gone. I rushed to and fro like one distracted,&#10;uttering cries of despair, and when from the shore I saw the vessel&#10;under full sail just disappearing upon the horizon, I wished&#10;bitterly enough that I had been content to stay at home in safety.&#10;But since wishes could do me no good, I presently took courage and&#10;looked about me for a means of escape. When I had climbed a tall&#10;tree I first of all directed my anxious glances towards the sea;&#10;but, finding nothing hopeful there, I turned landward, and my&#10;curiosity was excited by a huge dazzling white object, so far off&#10;that I could not make out what it might be.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Descending from the tree I hastily collected what remained of my&#10;provisions and set off as fast as I could go towards it. As I drew&#10;near it seemed to me to be a white ball of immense size and height,&#10;and when I could touch it, I found it marvellously smooth and soft.&#10;As it was impossible to climb it&#8212;for it presented no foot-hold&#8212; I&#10;walked round about it seeking some opening, but there was none. I&#10;counted, however, that it was at least fifty paces round. By this&#10;time the sun was near setting, but quite suddenly it fell dark,&#10;something like a huge black cloud came swiftly over me, and I saw&#10;with amazement that it was a bird of extraordinary size which was&#10;hovering near. Then I remembered that I had often heard the sailors&#10;speak of a wonderful bird called a roc, and it occurred to me that&#10;the white object which had so puzzled me must be its egg.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Sure enough the bird settled slowly down upon it, covering it&#10;with its wings to keep it warm, and I cowered close beside the egg&#10;in such a position that one of the bird&#39;s feet, which was as large&#10;as the trunk of a tree, was just in front of me. Taking off my&#10;turban I bound myself securely to it with the linen in the hope&#10;that the roc, when it took flight next morning, would bear me away&#10;with it from the desolate island. And this was precisely what did&#10;happen. As soon as the dawn appeared the bird rose into the air&#10;carrying me up and up till I could no longer see the earth, and&#10;then suddenly it descended so swiftly that I almost lost&#10;consciousness. When I became aware that the roc had settled and&#10;that I was once again upon solid ground, I hastily unbound my&#10;turban from its foot and freed myself, and that not a moment too&#10;soon; for the bird, pouncing upon a huge snake, killed it with a&#10;few blows from its powerful beak, and seizing it up rose into the&#10;air once more and soon disappeared from my view. When I had looked&#10;about me I began to doubt if I had gained anything by quitting the&#10;desolate island.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The valley in which I found myself was deep and narrow, and&#10;surrounded by mountains which towered into the clouds, and were so&#10;steep and rocky that there was no way of climbing up their sides.&#10;As I wandered about, seeking anxiously for some means of escaping&#10;from this trap, I observed that the ground was strewed with&#10;diamonds, some of them of an astonishing size. This sight gave me&#10;great pleasure, but my delight was speedily damped when I saw also&#10;numbers of horrible snakes so long and so large that the smallest&#10;of them could have swallowed an elephant with ease. Fortunately for&#10;me they seemed to hide in caverns of the rocks by day, and only&#10;came out by night, probably because of their enemy the roc.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;All day long I wandered up and down the valley, and when it grew&#10;dusk I crept into a little cave, and having blocked up the entrance&#10;to it with a stone, I ate part of my little store of food and lay&#10;down to sleep, but all through the night the serpents crawled to&#10;and fro, hissing horribly, so that I could scarcely close my eyes&#10;for terror. I was thankful when the morning light appeared, and&#10;when I judged by the silence that the serpents had retreated to&#10;their dens I came tremblingly out of my cave and wandered up and&#10;down the valley once more, kicking the diamonds contemptuously out&#10;of my path, for I felt that they were indeed vain things to a man&#10;in my situation. At last, overcome with weariness, I sat down upon&#10;a rock, but I had hardly closed my eyes when I was startled by&#10;something which fell to the ground with a thud close beside me.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was a huge piece of fresh meat, and as I stared at it several&#10;more pieces rolled over the cliffs in different places. I had&#10;always thought that the stories the sailors told of the famous&#10;valley of diamonds, and of the cunning way which some merchants had&#10;devised for getting at the precious stones, were mere travellers&#39;&#10;tales invented to give pleasure to the hearers, but now I perceived&#10;that they were surely true. These merchants came to the valley at&#10;the time when the eagles, which keep their eyries in the rocks, had&#10;hatched their young. The merchants then threw great lumps of meat&#10;into the valley. These, falling with so much force upon the&#10;diamonds, were sure to take up some of the precious stones with&#10;them, when the eagles pounced upon the meat and carried it off to&#10;their nests to feed their hungry broods. Then the merchants,&#10;scaring away the parent birds with shouts and outcries, would&#10;secure their treasures. Until this moment I had looked upon the&#10;valley as my grave, for I had seen no possibility of getting out of&#10;it alive, but now I took courage and began to devise a means of&#10;escape. I began by picking up all the largest diamonds I could find&#10;and storing them carefully in the leathern wallet which had held my&#10;provisions; this I tied securely to my belt. I then chose the piece&#10;of meat which seemed most suited to my purpose, and with the aid of&#10;my turban bound it firmly to my back; this done I laid down upon my&#10;face and awaited the coming of the eagles. I soon heard the&#10;flapping of their mighty wings above me, and had the satisfaction&#10;of feeling one of them seize upon my piece of meat, and me with it,&#10;and rise slowly towards his nest, into which he presently dropped&#10;me. Luckily for me the merchants were on the watch, and setting up&#10;their usual outcries they rushed to the nest scaring away the&#10;eagle. Their amazement was great when they discovered me, and also&#10;their disappointment, and with one accord they fell to abusing me&#10;for having robbed them of their usual profit. Addressing myself to&#10;the one who seemed most aggrieved, I said: &#34;I am sure, if you knew&#10;all that I have suffered, you would show more kindness towards me,&#10;and as for diamonds, I have enough here of the very best for you&#10;and me and all your company.&#34; So saying I showed them to him. The&#10;others all crowded round me, wondering at my adventures and&#10;admiring the device by which I had escaped from the valley, and&#10;when they had led me to their camp and examined my diamonds, they&#10;assured me that in all the years that they had carried on their&#10;trade they had seen no stones to be compared with them for size and&#10;beauty.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I found that each merchant chose a particular nest, and took his&#10;chance of what he might find in it. So I begged the one who owned&#10;the nest to which I had been carried to take as much as he would of&#10;my treasure, but he contented himself with one stone, and that by&#10;no means the largest, assuring me that with such a gem his fortune&#10;was made, and he need toil no more. I stayed with the merchants&#10;several days, and then as they were journeying homewards I gladly&#10;accompanied them. Our way lay across high mountains infested with&#10;frightful serpents, but we had the good luck to escape them and&#10;came at last to the seashore. Thence we sailed to the isle of Rohat&#10;where the camphor trees grow to such a size that a hundred men&#10;could shelter under one of them with ease. The sap flows from an&#10;incision made high up in the tree into a vessel hung there to&#10;receive it, and soon hardens into the substance called camphor, but&#10;the tree itself withers up and dies when it has been so&#10;treated.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In this same island we saw the rhinoceros, an animal which is&#10;smaller than the elephant and larger than the buffalo. It has one&#10;horn about a cubit long which is solid, but has a furrow from the&#10;base to the tip. Upon it is traced in white lines the figure of a&#10;man. The rhinoceros fights with the elephant, and transfixing him&#10;with his horn carries him off upon his head, but becoming blinded&#10;with the blood of his enemy, he falls helpless to the ground, and&#10;then comes the roc, and clutches them both up in his talons and&#10;takes them to feed his young. This doubtless astonishes you, but if&#10;you do not believe my tale go to Rohat and see for yourself. For&#10;fear of wearying you I pass over in silence many other wonderful&#10;things which we saw in this island. Before we left I exchanged one&#10;of my diamonds for much goodly merchandise by which I profited&#10;greatly on our homeward way. At last we reached Balsora, whence I&#10;hastened to Bagdad, where my first action was to bestow large sums&#10;of money upon the poor, after which I settled down to enjoy&#10;tranquilly the riches I had gained with so much toil and pain.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Having thus related the adventures of his second voyage, Sindbad&#10;again bestowed a hundred sequins upon Hindbad, inviting him to come&#10;again on the following day and hear how he fared upon his third&#10;voyage. The other guests also departed to their homes, but all&#10;returned at the same hour next day, including the porter, whose&#10;former life of hard work and poverty had already begun to seem to&#10;him like a bad dream. Again after the feast was over did Sindbad&#10;claim the attention of his guests and began the account of his&#10;third voyage.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 3, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/208', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('Third Voyage'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;After a very short time the pleasant easy life I led made me&#10;quite forget the perils of my two voyages. Moreover, as I was still&#10;in the prime of life, it pleased me better to be up and doing. So&#10;once more providing myself with the rarest and choicest merchandise&#10;of Bagdad, I conveyed it to Balsora, and set sail with other&#10;merchants of my acquaintance for distant lands. We had touched at&#10;many ports and made much profit, when one day upon the open sea we&#10;were caught by a terrible wind which blew us completely out of our&#10;reckoning, and lasting for several days finally drove us into&#10;harbour on a strange island.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I would rather have come to anchor anywhere than here,&#34; quoth&#10;our captain. &#34;This island and all adjoining it are inhabited by&#10;hairy savages, who are certain to attack us, and whatever these&#10;dwarfs may do we dare not resist, since they swarm like locusts,&#10;and if one of them is killed the rest will fall upon us, and&#10;speedily make an end of us.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;These words caused great consternation among all the ship&#39;s&#10;company, and only too soon we were to find out that the captain&#10;spoke truly. There appeared a vast multitude of hideous savages,&#10;not more than two feet high and covered with reddish fur. Throwing&#10;themselves into the waves they surrounded our vessel. Chattering&#10;meanwhile in a language we could not understand, and clutching at&#10;ropes and gangways, they swarmed up the ship&#39;s side with such speed&#10;and agility that they almost seemed to fly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;You may imagine the rage and terror that seized us as we watched&#10;them, neither daring to hinder them nor able to speak a word to&#10;deter them from their purpose, whatever it might be. Of this we&#10;were not left long in doubt. Hoisting the sails, and cutting the&#10;cable of the anchor, they sailed our vessel to an island which lay&#10;a little further off, where they drove us ashore; then taking&#10;possession of her, they made off to the place from which they had&#10;come, leaving us helpless upon a shore avoided with horror by all&#10;mariners for a reason which you will soon learn.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Turning away from the sea we wandered miserably inland, finding&#10;as we went various herbs and fruits which we ate, feeling that we&#10;might as well live as long as possible though we had no hope of&#10;escape. Presently we saw in the far distance what seemed to us to&#10;be a splendid palace, towards which we turned our weary steps, but&#10;when we reached it we saw that it was a castle, lofty, and strongly&#10;built. Pushing back the heavy ebony doors we entered the courtyard,&#10;but upon the threshold of the great hall beyond it we paused,&#10;frozen with horror, at the sight which greeted us. On one side lay&#10;a huge pile of bones&#8212;human bones, and on the other numberless spits&#10;for roasting! Overcome with despair we sank trembling to the&#10;ground, and lay there without speech or motion. The sun was setting&#10;when a loud noise aroused us, the door of the hall was violently&#10;burst open and a horrible giant entered. He was as tall as a palm&#10;tree, and perfectly black, and had one eye, which flamed like a&#10;burning coal in the middle of his forehead. His teeth were long and&#10;sharp and grinned horribly, while his lower lip hung down upon his&#10;chest, and he had ears like elephant&#39;s ears, which covered his&#10;shoulders, and nails like the claws of some fierce bird.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At this terrible sight our senses left us and we lay like dead&#10;men. When at last we came to ourselves the giant sat examining us&#10;attentively with his fearful eye. Presently when he had looked at&#10;us enough he came towards us, and stretching out his hand took me&#10;by the back of the neck, turning me this way and that, but feeling&#10;that I was mere skin and bone he set me down again and went on to&#10;the next, whom he treated in the same fashion; at last he came to&#10;the captain, and finding him the fattest of us all, he took him up&#10;in one hand and stuck him upon a spit and proceeded to kindle a&#10;huge fire at which he presently roasted him. After the giant had&#10;supped he lay down to sleep, snoring like the loudest thunder,&#10;while we lay shivering with horror the whole night through, and&#10;when day broke he awoke and went out, leaving us in the castle.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When we believed him to be really gone we started up bemoaning&#10;our horrible fate, until the hall echoed with our despairing cries.&#10;Though we were many and our enemy was alone it did not occur to us&#10;to kill him, and indeed we should have found that a hard task, even&#10;if we had thought of it, and no plan could we devise to deliver&#10;ourselves. So at last, submitting to our sad fate, we spent the day&#10;in wandering up and down the island eating such fruits as we could&#10;find, and when night came we returned to the castle, having sought&#10;in vain for any other place of shelter. At sunset the giant&#10;returned, supped upon one of our unhappy comrades, slept and snored&#10;till dawn, and then left us as before. Our condition seemed to us&#10;so frightful that several of my companions thought it would be&#10;better to leap from the cliffs and perish in the waves at once,&#10;rather than await so miserable an end; but I had a plan of escape&#10;which I now unfolded to them, and which they at once agreed to&#10;attempt.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Listen, my brothers,&#34; I added. &#34;You know that plenty of&#10;driftwood lies along the shore. Let us make several rafts, and&#10;carry them to a suitable place. If our plot succeeds, we can wait&#10;patiently for the chance of some passing ship which would rescue us&#10;from this fatal island. If it fails, we must quickly take to our&#10;rafts; frail as they are, we have more chance of saving our lives&#10;with them than we have if we remain here.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;All agreed with me, and we spent the day in building rafts, each&#10;capable of carrying three persons. At nightfall we returned to the&#10;castle, and very soon in came the giant, and one more of our number&#10;was sacrificed. But the time of our vengeance was at hand! As soon&#10;as he had finished his horrible repast he lay down to sleep as&#10;before, and when we heard him begin to snore I, and nine of the&#10;boldest of my comrades, rose softly, and took each a spit, which we&#10;made red-hot in the fire, and then at a given signal we plunged it&#10;with one accord into the giant&#39;s eye, completely blinding him.&#10;Uttering a terrible cry, he sprang to his feet clutching in all&#10;directions to try to seize one of us, but we had all fled different&#10;ways as soon as the deed was done, and thrown ourselves flat upon&#10;the ground in corners where he was not likely to touch us with his&#10;feet.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;After a vain search he fumbled about till he found the door, and&#10;fled out of it howling frightfully. As for us, when he was gone we&#10;made haste to leave the fatal castle, and, stationing ourselves&#10;beside our rafts, we waited to see what would happen. Our idea was&#10;that if, when the sun rose, we saw nothing of the giant, and no&#10;longer heard his howls, which still came faintly through the&#10;darkness, growing more and more distant, we should conclude that he&#10;was dead, and that we might safely stay upon the island and need&#10;not risk our lives upon the frail rafts. But alas! morning light&#10;showed us our enemy approaching us, supported on either hand by two&#10;giants nearly as large and fearful as himself, while a crowd of&#10;others followed close upon their heels. Hesitating no longer we&#10;clambered upon our rafts and rowed with all our might out to sea.&#10;The giants, seeing their prey escaping them, seized up huge pieces&#10;of rock, and wading into the water hurled them after us with such&#10;good aim that all the rafts except the one I was upon were swamped,&#10;and their luckless crews drowned, without our being able to do&#10;anything to help them. Indeed I and my two companions had all we&#10;could do to keep our own raft beyond the reach of the giants, but&#10;by dint of hard rowing we at last gained the open sea. Here we were&#10;at the mercy of the winds and waves, which tossed us to and fro all&#10;that day and night, but the next morning we found ourselves near an&#10;island, upon which we gladly landed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There we found delicious fruits, and having satisfied our hunger&#10;we presently lay down to rest upon the shore. Suddenly we were&#10;aroused by a loud rustling noise, and starting up, saw that it was&#10;caused by an immense snake which was gliding towards us over the&#10;sand. So swiftly it came that it had seized one of my comrades&#10;before he had time to fly, and in spite of his cries and struggles&#10;speedily crushed the life out of him in its mighty coils and&#10;proceeded to swallow him. By this time my other companion and I&#10;were running for our lives to some place where we might hope to be&#10;safe from this new horror, and seeing a tall tree we climbed up&#10;into it, having first provided ourselves with a store of fruit off&#10;the surrounding bushes. When night came I fell asleep, but only to&#10;be awakened once more by the terrible snake, which after hissing&#10;horribly round the tree at last reared itself up against it, and&#10;finding my sleeping comrade who was perched just below me, it&#10;swallowed him also, and crawled away leaving me half dead with&#10;terror.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When the sun rose I crept down from the tree with hardly a hope&#10;of escaping the dreadful fate which had over-taken my comrades; but&#10;life is sweet, and I determined to do all I could to save myself.&#10;All day long I toiled with frantic haste and collected quantities&#10;of dry brushwood, reeds and thorns, which I bound with faggots, and&#10;making a circle of them under my tree I piled them firmly one upon&#10;another until I had a kind of tent in which I crouched like a mouse&#10;in a hole when she sees the cat coming. You may imagine what a&#10;fearful night I passed, for the snake returned eager to devour me,&#10;and glided round and round my frail shelter seeking an entrance.&#10;Every moment I feared that it would succeed in pushing aside some&#10;of the faggots, but happily for me they held together, and when it&#10;grew light my enemy retired, baffled and hungry, to his den. As for&#10;me I was more dead than alive! Shaking with fright and half&#10;suffocated by the poisonous breath of the monster, I came out of my&#10;tent and crawled down to the sea, feeling that it would be better&#10;to plunge from the cliffs and end my life at once than pass such&#10;another night of horror. But to my joy and relief I saw a ship&#10;sailing by, and by shouting wildly and waving my turban I managed&#10;to attract the attention of her crew.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A boat was sent to rescue me, and very soon I found myself on&#10;board surrounded by a wondering crowd of sailors and merchants&#10;eager to know by what chance I found myself in that desolate&#10;island. After I had told my story they regaled me with the choicest&#10;food the ship afforded, and the captain, seeing that I was in rags,&#10;generously bestowed upon me one of his own coats. After sailing&#10;about for some time and touching at many ports we came at last to&#10;the island of Salahat, where sandal wood grows in great abundance.&#10;Here we anchored, and as I stood watching the merchants&#10;disembarking their goods and preparing to sell or exchange them,&#10;the captain came up to me and said,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I have here, brother, some merchandise belonging to a passenger&#10;of mine who is dead. Will you do me the favour to trade with it,&#10;and when I meet with his heirs I shall be able to give them the&#10;money, though it will be only just that you shall have a portion&#10;for your trouble.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I consented gladly, for I did not like standing by idle.&#10;Whereupon he pointed the bales out to me, and sent for the person&#10;whose duty it was to keep a list of the goods that were upon the&#10;ship. When this man came he asked in what name the merchandise was&#10;to be registered.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;In the name of Sindbad the Sailor,&#34; replied the captain.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At this I was greatly surprised, but looking carefully at him I&#10;recognised him to be the captain of the ship upon which I had made&#10;my second voyage, though he had altered much since that time. As&#10;for him, believing me to be dead it was no wonder that he had not&#10;recognised me.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;So, captain,&#34; said I, &#34;the merchant who owned those bales was&#10;called Sindbad?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes,&#34; he replied. &#34;He was so named. He belonged to Bagdad, and&#10;joined my ship at Balsora, but by mischance he was left behind upon&#10;a desert island where we had landed to fill up our water-casks, and&#10;it was not until four hours later that he was missed. By that time&#10;the wind had freshened, and it was impossible to put back for&#10;him.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You suppose him to have perished then?&#34; said I.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Alas! yes,&#34; he answered.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why, captain!&#34; I cried, &#34;look well at me. I am that Sindbad who&#10;fell asleep upon the island and awoke to find himself&#10;abandoned!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The captain stared at me in amazement, but was presently&#10;convinced that I was indeed speaking the truth, and rejoiced&#10;greatly at my escape.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I am glad to have that piece of carelessness off my conscience&#10;at any rate,&#34; said he. &#34;Now take your goods, and the profit I have&#10;made for you upon them, and may you prosper in future.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I took them gratefully, and as we went from one island to&#10;another I laid in stores of cloves, cinnamon, and other spices. In&#10;one place I saw a tortoise which was twenty cubits long and as many&#10;broad, also a fish that was like a cow and had skin so thick that&#10;it was used to make shields. Another I saw that was like a camel in&#10;shape and colour. So by degrees we came back to Balsora, and I&#10;returned to Bagdad with so much money that I could not myself count&#10;it, besides treasures without end. I gave largely to the poor, and&#10;bought much land to add to what I already possessed, and thus ended&#10;my third voyage.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When Sindbad had finished his story he gave another hundred&#10;sequins to Hindbad, who then departed with the other guests, but&#10;next day when they had all reassembled, and the banquet was ended,&#10;their host continued his adventures.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 3, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/208', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('Fourth Voyage'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;Rich and happy as I was after my third voyage, I could not make&#10;up my mind to stay at home altogether. My love of trading, and the&#10;pleasure I took in anything that was new and strange, made me set&#10;my affairs in order, and begin my journey through some of the&#10;Persian provinces, having first sent off stores of goods to await&#10;my coming in the different places I intended to visit. I took ship&#10;at a distant seaport, and for some time all went well, but at last,&#10;being caught in a violent hurricane, our vessel became a total&#10;wreck in spite of all our worthy captain could do to save her, and&#10;many of our company perished in the waves. I, with a few others,&#10;had the good fortune to be washed ashore clinging to pieces of the&#10;wreck, for the storm had driven us near an island, and scrambling&#10;up beyond the reach of the waves we threw ourselves down quite&#10;exhausted, to wait for morning.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At daylight we wandered inland, and soon saw some huts, to which&#10;we directed our steps. As we drew near their black inhabitants&#10;swarmed out in great numbers and surrounded us, and we were led to&#10;their houses, and as it were divided among our captors. I with five&#10;others was taken into a hut, where we were made to sit upon the&#10;ground, and certain herbs were given to us, which the blacks made&#10;signs to us to eat. Observing that they themselves did not touch&#10;them, I was careful only to pretend to taste my portion; but my&#10;companions, being very hungry, rashly ate up all that was set&#10;before them, and very soon I had the horror of seeing them become&#10;perfectly mad. Though they chattered incessantly I could not&#10;understand a word they said, nor did they heed when I spoke to&#10;them. The savages now produced large bowls full of rice prepared&#10;with cocoanut oil, of which my crazy comrades ate eagerly, but I&#10;only tasted a few grains, understanding clearly that the object of&#10;our captors was to fatten us speedily for their own eating, and&#10;this was exactly what happened. My unlucky companions having lost&#10;their reason, felt neither anxiety nor fear, and ate greedily all&#10;that was offered them. So they were soon fat and there was an end&#10;of them, but I grew leaner day by day, for I ate but little, and&#10;even that little did me no good by reason of my fear of what lay&#10;before me. However, as I was so far from being a tempting morsel, I&#10;was allowed to wander about freely, and one day, when all the&#10;blacks had gone off upon some expedition leaving only an old man to&#10;guard me, I managed to escape from him and plunged into the forest,&#10;running faster the more he cried to me to come back, until I had&#10;completely distanced him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For seven days I hurried on, resting only when the darkness&#10;stopped me, and living chiefly upon cocoanuts, which afforded me&#10;both meat and drink, and on the eighth day I reached the seashore&#10;and saw a party of white men gathering pepper, which grew&#10;abundantly all about. Reassured by the nature of their occupation,&#10;I advanced towards them and they greeted me in Arabic, asking who I&#10;was and whence I came. My delight was great on hearing this&#10;familiar speech, and I willingly satisfied their curiosity, telling&#10;them how I had been shipwrecked, and captured by the blacks. &#34;But&#10;these savages devour men!&#34; said they. &#34;How did you escape?&#34; I&#10;repeated to them what I have just told you, at which they were&#10;mightily astonished. I stayed with them until they had collected as&#10;much pepper as they wished, and then they took me back to their own&#10;country and presented me to their king, by whom I was hospitably&#10;received. To him also I had to relate my adventures, which&#10;surprised him much, and when I had finished he ordered that I&#10;should be supplied with food and raiment and treated with&#10;consideration.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The island on which I found myself was full of people, and&#10;abounded in all sorts of desirable things, and a great deal of&#10;traffic went on in the capital, where I soon began to feel at home&#10;and contented. Moreover, the king treated me with special favour,&#10;and in consequence of this everyone, whether at the court or in the&#10;town, sought to make life pleasant to me. One thing I remarked&#10;which I thought very strange; this was that, from the greatest to&#10;the least, all men rode their horses without bridle or stirrups. I&#10;one day presumed to ask his majesty why he did not use them, to&#10;which he replied, &#34;You speak to me of things of which I have never&#10;before heard!&#34; This gave me an idea. I found a clever workman, and&#10;made him cut out under my direction the foundation of a saddle,&#10;which I wadded and covered with choice leather, adorning it with&#10;rich gold embroidery. I then got a lock-smith to make me a bit and&#10;a pair of spurs after a pattern that I drew for him, and when all&#10;these things were completed I presented them to the king and showed&#10;him how to use them. When I had saddled one of his horses he&#10;mounted it and rode about quite delighted with the novelty, and to&#10;show his gratitude he rewarded me with large gifts. After this I&#10;had to make saddles for all the principal officers of the king&#39;s&#10;household, and as they all gave me rich presents I soon became very&#10;wealthy and quite an important person in the city.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;One day the king sent for me and said, &#34;Sindbad, I am going to&#10;ask a favour of you. Both I and my subjects esteem you, and wish&#10;you to end your days amongst us. Therefore I desire that you will&#10;marry a rich and beautiful lady whom I will find for you, and think&#10;no more of your own country.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As the king&#39;s will was law I accepted the charming bride he&#10;presented to me, and lived happily with her. Nevertheless I had&#10;every intention of escaping at the first opportunity, and going&#10;back to Bagdad. Things were thus going prosperously with me when it&#10;happened that the wife of one of my neighbours, with whom I had&#10;struck up quite a friendship, fell ill, and presently died. I went&#10;to his house to offer my consolations, and found him in the depths&#10;of woe.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Heaven preserve you,&#34; said I, &#34;and send you a long life!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Alas!&#34; he replied, &#34;what is the good of saying that when I have&#10;but an hour left to live!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Come, come!&#34; said I, &#34;surely it is not so bad as all that. I&#10;trust that you may be spared to me for many years.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I hope,&#34; answered he, &#34;that your life may be long, but as for&#10;me, all is finished. I have set my house in order, and to-day I&#10;shall be buried with my wife. This has been the law upon our island&#10;from the earliest ages&#8212;the living husband goes to the grave with&#10;his dead wife, the living wife with her dead husband. So did our&#10;fathers, and so must we do. The law changes not, and all must&#10;submit to it!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As he spoke the friends and relations of the unhappy pair began&#10;to assemble. The body, decked in rich robes and sparkling with&#10;jewels, was laid upon an open bier, and the procession started,&#10;taking its way to a high mountain at some distance from the city,&#10;the wretched husband, clothed from head to foot in a black mantle,&#10;following mournfully.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When the place of interment was reached the corpse was lowered,&#10;just as it was, into a deep pit. Then the husband, bidding farewell&#10;to all his friends, stretched himself upon another bier, upon which&#10;were laid seven little loaves of bread and a pitcher of water, and&#10;he also was let down-down-down to the depths of the horrible&#10;cavern, and then a stone was laid over the opening, and the&#10;melancholy company wended its way back to the city.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;You may imagine that I was no unmoved spectator of these&#10;proceedings; to all the others it was a thing to which they had&#10;been accustomed from their youth up; but I was so horrified that I&#10;could not help telling the king how it struck me.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Sire,&#34; I said, &#34;I am more astonished than I can express to you&#10;at the strange custom which exists in your dominions of burying the&#10;living with the dead. In all my travels I have never before met&#10;with so cruel and horrible a law.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What would you have, Sindbad?&#34; he replied. &#34;It is the law for&#10;everybody. I myself should be buried with the Queen if she were the&#10;first to die.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But, your Majesty,&#34; said I, &#34;dare I ask if this law applies to&#10;foreigners also?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why, yes,&#34; replied the king smiling, in what I could but&#10;consider a very heartless manner, &#34;they are no exception to the&#10;rule if they have married in the country.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When I heard this I went home much cast down, and from that time&#10;forward my mind was never easy. If only my wife&#39;s little finger&#10;ached I fancied she was going to die, and sure enough before very&#10;long she fell really ill and in a few days breathed her last. My&#10;dismay was great, for it seemed to me that to be buried alive was&#10;even a worse fate than to be devoured by cannibals, nevertheless&#10;there was no escape. The body of my wife, arrayed in her richest&#10;robes and decked with all her jewels, was laid upon the bier. I&#10;followed it, and after me came a great procession, headed by the&#10;king and all his nobles, and in this order we reached the fatal&#10;mountain, which was one of a lofty chain bordering the sea.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Here I made one more frantic effort to excite the pity of the&#10;king and those who stood by, hoping to save myself even at this&#10;last moment, but it was of no avail. No one spoke to me, they even&#10;appeared to hasten over their dreadful task, and I speedily found&#10;myself descending into the gloomy pit, with my seven loaves and&#10;pitcher of water beside me. Almost before I reached the bottom the&#10;stone was rolled into its place above my head, and I was left to my&#10;fate. A feeble ray of light shone into the cavern through some&#10;chink, and when I had the courage to look about me I could see that&#10;I was in a vast vault, bestrewn with bones and bodies of the dead.&#10;I even fancied that I heard the expiring sighs of those who, like&#10;myself, had come into this dismal place alive. All in vain did I&#10;shriek aloud with rage and despair, reproaching myself for the love&#10;of gain and adventure which had brought me to such a pass, but at&#10;length, growing calmer, I took up my bread and water, and wrapping&#10;my face in my mantle I groped my way towards the end of the cavern,&#10;where the air was fresher.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Here I lived in darkness and misery until my provisions were&#10;exhausted, but just as I was nearly dead from starvation the rock&#10;was rolled away overhead and I saw that a bier was being lowered&#10;into the cavern, and that the corpse upon it was a man. In a moment&#10;my mind was made up, the woman who followed had nothing to expect&#10;but a lingering death; I should be doing her a service if I&#10;shortened her misery. Therefore when she descended, already&#10;insensible from terror, I was ready armed with a huge bone, one&#10;blow from which left her dead, and I secured the bread and water&#10;which gave me a hope of life. Several times did I have recourse to&#10;this desperate expedient, and I know not how long I had been a&#10;prisoner when one day I fancied that I heard something near me,&#10;which breathed loudly. Turning to the place from which the sound&#10;came I dimly saw a shadowy form which fled at my movement,&#10;squeezing itself through a cranny in the wall. I pursued it as fast&#10;as I could, and found myself in a narrow crack among the rocks,&#10;along which I was just able to force my way. I followed it for what&#10;seemed to me many miles, and at last saw before me a glimmer of&#10;light which grew clearer every moment until I emerged upon the sea&#10;shore with a joy which I cannot describe. When I was sure that I&#10;was not dreaming, I realised that it was doubtless some little&#10;animal which had found its way into the cavern from the sea, and&#10;when disturbed had fled, showing me a means of escape which I could&#10;never have discovered for myself. I hastily surveyed my&#10;surroundings, and saw that I was safe from all pursuit from the&#10;town.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The mountains sloped sheer down to the sea, and there was no&#10;road across them. Being assured of this I returned to the cavern,&#10;and amassed a rich treasure of diamonds, rubies, emeralds, and&#10;jewels of all kinds which strewed the ground. These I made up into&#10;bales, and stored them into a safe place upon the beach, and then&#10;waited hopefully for the passing of a ship. I had looked out for&#10;two days, however, before a single sail appeared, so it was with&#10;much delight that I at last saw a vessel not very far from the&#10;shore, and by waving my arms and uttering loud cries succeeded in&#10;attracting the attention of her crew. A boat was sent off to me,&#10;and in answer to the questions of the sailors as to how I came to&#10;be in such a plight, I replied that I had been shipwrecked two days&#10;before, but had managed to scramble ashore with the bales which I&#10;pointed out to them. Luckily for me they believed my story, and&#10;without even looking at the place where they found me, took up my&#10;bundles, and rowed me back to the ship. Once on board, I soon saw&#10;that the captain was too much occupied with the difficulties of&#10;navigation to pay much heed to me, though he generously made me&#10;welcome, and would not even accept the jewels with which I offered&#10;to pay my passage. Our voyage was prosperous, and after visiting&#10;many lands, and collecting in each place great store of goodly&#10;merchandise, I found myself at last in Bagdad once more with&#10;unheard of riches of every description. Again I gave large sums of&#10;money to the poor, and enriched all the mosques in the city, after&#10;which I gave myself up to my friends and relations, with whom I&#10;passed my time in feasting and merriment.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Here Sindbad paused, and all his hearers declared that the&#10;adventures of his fourth voyage had pleased them better than&#10;anything they had heard before. They then took their leave,&#10;followed by Hindbad, who had once more received a hundred sequins,&#10;and with the rest had been bidden to return next day for the story&#10;of the fifth voyage.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When the time came all were in their places, and when they had&#10;eaten and drunk of all that was set before them Sindbad began his&#10;tale.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 3, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/208', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('Fifth Voyage'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;Not even all that I had gone through could make me contented&#10;with a quiet life. I soon wearied of its pleasures, and longed for&#10;change and adventure. Therefore I set out once more, but this time&#10;in a ship of my own, which I built and fitted out at the nearest&#10;seaport. I wished to be able to call at whatever port I chose,&#10;taking my own time; but as I did not intend carrying enough goods&#10;for a full cargo, I invited several merchants of different nations&#10;to join me. We set sail with the first favourable wind, and after a&#10;long voyage upon the open seas we landed upon an unknown island&#10;which proved to be uninhabited. We determined, however, to explore&#10;it, but had not gone far when we found a roc&#39;s egg, as large as the&#10;one I had seen before and evidently very nearly hatched, for the&#10;beak of the young bird had already pierced the shell. In spite of&#10;all I could say to deter them, the merchants who were with me fell&#10;upon it with their hatchets, breaking the shell, and killing the&#10;young roc. Then lighting a fire upon the ground they hacked morsels&#10;from the bird, and proceeded to roast them while I stood by&#10;aghast.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Scarcely had they finished their ill-omened repast, when the air&#10;above us was darkened by two mighty shadows. The captain of my&#10;ship, knowing by experience what this meant, cried out to us that&#10;the parent birds were coming, and urged us to get on board with all&#10;speed. This we did, and the sails were hoisted, but before we had&#10;made any way the rocs reached their despoiled nest and hovered&#10;about it, uttering frightful cries when they discovered the mangled&#10;remains of their young one. For a moment we lost sight of them, and&#10;were flattering ourselves that we had escaped, when they reappeared&#10;and soared into the air directly over our vessel, and we saw that&#10;each held in its claws an immense rock ready to crush us. There was&#10;a moment of breathless suspense, then one bird loosed its hold and&#10;the huge block of stone hurtled through the air, but thanks to the&#10;presence of mind of the helmsman, who turned our ship violently in&#10;another direction, it fell into the sea close beside us, cleaving&#10;it asunder till we could nearly see the bottom. We had hardly time&#10;to draw a breath of relief before the other rock fell with a mighty&#10;crash right in the midst of our luckless vessel, smashing it into a&#10;thousand fragments, and crushing, or hurling into the sea,&#10;passengers and crew. I myself went down with the rest, but had the&#10;good fortune to rise unhurt, and by holding on to a piece of&#10;driftwood with one hand and swimming with the other I kept myself&#10;afloat and was presently washed up by the tide on to an island. Its&#10;shores were steep and rocky, but I scrambled up safely and threw&#10;myself down to rest upon the green turf.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When I had somewhat recovered I began to examine the spot in&#10;which I found myself, and truly it seemed to me that I had reached&#10;a garden of delights. There were trees everywhere, and they were&#10;laden with flowers and fruit, while a crystal stream wandered in&#10;and out under their shadow. When night came I slept sweetly in a&#10;cosy nook, though the remembrance that I was alone in a strange&#10;land made me sometimes start up and look around me in alarm, and&#10;then I wished heartily that I had stayed at home at ease. However,&#10;the morning sunlight restored my courage, and I once more wandered&#10;among the trees, but always with some anxiety as to what I might&#10;see next. I had penetrated some distance into the island when I saw&#10;an old man bent and feeble sitting upon the river bank, and at&#10;first I took him to be some ship-wrecked mariner like myself. Going&#10;up to him I greeted him in a friendly way, but he only nodded his&#10;head at me in reply. I then asked what he did there, and he made&#10;signs to me that he wished to get across the river to gather some&#10;fruit, and seemed to beg me to carry him on my back. Pitying his&#10;age and feebleness, I took him up, and wading across the stream I&#10;bent down that he might more easily reach the bank, and bade him&#10;get down. But instead of allowing himself to be set upon his feet&#10;(even now it makes me laugh to think of it!), this creature who had&#10;seemed to me so decrepit leaped nimbly upon my shoulders, and&#10;hooking his legs round my neck gripped me so tightly that I was&#10;well-nigh choked, and so overcome with terror that I fell&#10;insensible to the ground. When I recovered my enemy was still in&#10;his place, though he had released his hold enough to allow me&#10;breathing space, and seeing me revive he prodded me adroitly first&#10;with one foot and then with the other, until I was forced to get up&#10;and stagger about with him under the trees while he gathered and&#10;ate the choicest fruits. This went on all day, and even at night,&#10;when I threw myself down half dead with weariness, the terrible old&#10;man held on tight to my neck, nor did he fail to greet the first&#10;glimmer of morning light by drumming upon me with his heels, until&#10;I perforce awoke and resumed my dreary march with rage and&#10;bitterness in my heart.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It happened one day that I passed a tree under which lay several&#10;dry gourds, and catching one up I amused myself with scooping out&#10;its contents and pressing into it the juice of several bunches of&#10;grapes which hung from every bush. When it was full I left it&#10;propped in the fork of a tree, and a few days later, carrying the&#10;hateful old man that way, I snatched at my gourd as I passed it and&#10;had the satisfaction of a draught of excellent wine so good and&#10;refreshing that I even forgot my detestable burden, and began to&#10;sing and caper.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The old monster was not slow to perceive the effect which my&#10;draught had produced and that I carried him more lightly than&#10;usual, so he stretched out his skinny hand and seizing the gourd&#10;first tasted its contents cautiously, then drained them to the very&#10;last drop. The wine was strong and the gourd capacious, so he also&#10;began to sing after a fashion, and soon I had the delight of&#10;feeling the iron grip of his goblin legs unclasp, and with one&#10;vigorous effort I threw him to the ground, from which he never&#10;moved again. I was so rejoiced to have at last got rid of this&#10;uncanny old man that I ran leaping and bounding down to the sea&#10;shore, where, by the greatest good luck, I met with some mariners&#10;who had anchored off the island to enjoy the delicious fruits, and&#10;to renew their supply of water.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;They heard the story of my escape with amazement, saying, &#34;You&#10;fell into the hands of the Old Man of the Sea, and it is a mercy&#10;that he did not strangle you as he has everyone else upon whose&#10;shoulders he has managed to perch himself. This island is well&#10;known as the scene of his evil deeds, and no merchant or sailor who&#10;lands upon it cares to stray far away from his comrades.&#34; After we&#10;had talked for a while they took me back with them on board their&#10;ship, where the captain received me kindly, and we soon set sail,&#10;and after several days reached a large and prosperous-looking town&#10;where all the houses were built of stone. Here we anchored, and one&#10;of the merchants, who had been very friendly to me on the way, took&#10;me ashore with him and showed me a lodging set apart for strange&#10;merchants. He then provided me with a large sack, and pointed out&#10;to me a party of others equipped in like manner.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Go with them,&#34; said he, &#34;and do as they do, but beware of&#10;losing sight of them, for if you strayed your life would be in&#10;danger.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With that he supplied me with provisions, and bade me farewell,&#10;and I set out with my new companions. I soon learnt that the object&#10;of our expedition was to fill our sacks with cocoanuts, but when at&#10;length I saw the trees and noted their immense height and the&#10;slippery smoothness of their slender trunks, I did not at all&#10;understand how we were to do it. The crowns of the cocoa-palms were&#10;all alive with monkeys, big and little, which skipped from one to&#10;the other with surprising agility, seeming to be curious about us&#10;and disturbed at our appearance, and I was at first surprised when&#10;my companions after collecting stones began to throw them at the&#10;lively creatures, which seemed to me quite harmless. But very soon&#10;I saw the reason of it and joined them heartily, for the monkeys,&#10;annoyed and wishing to pay us back in our own coin, began to tear&#10;the nuts from the trees and cast them at us with angry and spiteful&#10;gestures, so that after very little labour our sacks were filled&#10;with the fruit which we could not otherwise have obtained.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As soon as we had as many as we could carry we went back to the&#10;town, where my friend bought my share and advised me to continue&#10;the same occupation until I had earned money enough to carry me to&#10;my own country. This I did, and before long had amassed a&#10;considerable sum. Just then I heard that there was a trading ship&#10;ready to sail, and taking leave of my friend I went on board,&#10;carrying with me a goodly store of cocoanuts; and we sailed first&#10;to the islands where pepper grows, then to Comari where the best&#10;aloes wood is found, and where men drink no wine by an unalterable&#10;law. Here I exchanged my nuts for pepper and good aloes wood, and&#10;went a-fishing for pearls with some of the other merchants, and my&#10;divers were so lucky that very soon I had an immense number, and&#10;those very large and perfect. With all these treasures I came&#10;joyfully back to Bagdad, where I disposed of them for large sums of&#10;money, of which I did not fail as before to give the tenth part to&#10;the poor, and after that I rested from my labours and comforted&#10;myself with all the pleasures that my riches could give me.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Having thus ended his story, Sindbad ordered that one hundred&#10;sequins should be given to Hindbad, and the guests then withdrew;&#10;but after the next day&#39;s feast he began the account of his sixth&#10;voyage as follows.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 3, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/208', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('Sixth Voyage'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;It must be a marvel to you how, after having five times met with&#10;shipwreck and unheard of perils, I could again tempt fortune and&#10;risk fresh trouble. I am even surprised myself when I look back,&#10;but evidently it was my fate to rove, and after a year of repose I&#10;prepared to make a sixth voyage, regardless of the entreaties of my&#10;friends and relations, who did all they could to keep me at home.&#10;Instead of going by the Persian Gulf, I travelled a considerable&#10;way overland, and finally embarked from a distant Indian port with&#10;a captain who meant to make a long voyage. And truly he did so, for&#10;we fell in with stormy weather which drove us completely out of our&#10;course, so that for many days neither captain nor pilot knew where&#10;we were, nor where we were going. When they did at last discover&#10;our position we had small ground for rejoicing, for the captain,&#10;casting his turban upon the deck and tearing his beard, declared&#10;that we were in the most dangerous spot upon the whole wide sea,&#10;and had been caught by a current which was at that minute sweeping&#10;us to destruction. It was too true! In spite of all the sailors&#10;could do we were driven with frightful rapidity towards the foot of&#10;a mountain, which rose sheer out of the sea, and our vessel was&#10;dashed to pieces upon the rocks at its base, not, however, until we&#10;had managed to scramble on shore, carrying with us the most&#10;precious of our possessions. When we had done this the captain said&#10;to us:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Now we are here we may as well begin to dig our graves at once,&#10;since from this fatal spot no shipwrecked mariner has ever&#10;returned.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;This speech discouraged us much, and we began to lament over our&#10;sad fate.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The mountain formed the seaward boundary of a large island, and&#10;the narrow strip of rocky shore upon which we stood was strewn with&#10;the wreckage of a thousand gallant ships, while the bones of the&#10;luckless mariners shone white in the sunshine, and we shuddered to&#10;think how soon our own would be added to the heap. All around, too,&#10;lay vast quantities of the costliest merchandise, and treasures&#10;were heaped in every cranny of the rocks, but all these things only&#10;added to the desolation of the scene. It struck me as a very&#10;strange thing that a river of clear fresh water, which gushed out&#10;from the mountain not far from where we stood, instead of flowing&#10;into the sea as rivers generally do, turned off sharply, and flowed&#10;out of sight under a natural archway of rock, and when I went to&#10;examine it more closely I found that inside the cave the walls were&#10;thick with diamonds, and rubies, and masses of crystal, and the&#10;floor was strewn with ambergris. Here, then, upon this desolate&#10;shore we abandoned ourselves to our fate, for there was no&#10;possibility of scaling the mountain, and if a ship had appeared it&#10;could only have shared our doom. The first thing our captain did&#10;was to divide equally amongst us all the food we possessed, and&#10;then the length of each man&#39;s life depended on the time he could&#10;make his portion last. I myself could live upon very little.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Nevertheless, by the time I had buried the last of my companions&#10;my stock of provisions was so small that I hardly thought I should&#10;live long enough to dig my own grave, which I set about doing,&#10;while I regretted bitterly the roving disposition which was always&#10;bringing me into such straits, and thought longingly of all the&#10;comfort and luxury that I had left. But luckily for me the fancy&#10;took me to stand once more beside the river where it plunged out of&#10;sight in the depths of the cavern, and as I did so an idea struck&#10;me. This river which hid itself underground doubtless emerged again&#10;at some distant spot. Why should I not build a raft and trust&#10;myself to its swiftly flowing waters? If I perished before I could&#10;reach the light of day once more I should be no worse off than I&#10;was now, for death stared me in the face, while there was always&#10;the possibility that, as I was born under a lucky star, I might&#10;find myself safe and sound in some desirable land. I decided at any&#10;rate to risk it, and speedily built myself a stout raft of&#10;drift-wood with strong cords, of which enough and to spare lay&#10;strewn upon the beach. I then made up many packages of rubies,&#10;emeralds, rock crystal, ambergris, and precious stuffs, and bound&#10;them upon my raft, being careful to preserve the balance, and then&#10;I seated myself upon it, having two small oars that I had fashioned&#10;laid ready to my hand, and loosed the cord which held it to the&#10;bank. Once out in the current my raft flew swiftly under the gloomy&#10;archway, and I found myself in total darkness, carried smoothly&#10;forward by the rapid river. On I went as it seemed to me for many&#10;nights and days. Once the channel became so small that I had a&#10;narrow escape of being crushed against the rocky roof, and after&#10;that I took the precaution of lying flat upon my precious bales.&#10;Though I only ate what was absolutely necessary to keep myself&#10;alive, the inevitable moment came when, after swallowing my last&#10;morsel of food, I began to wonder if I must after all die of&#10;hunger. Then, worn out with anxiety and fatigue, I fell into a deep&#10;sleep, and when I again opened my eyes I was once more in the light&#10;of day; a beautiful country lay before me, and my raft, which was&#10;tied to the river bank, was surrounded by friendly looking black&#10;men. I rose and saluted them, and they spoke to me in return, but I&#10;could not understand a word of their language. Feeling perfectly&#10;bewildered by my sudden return to life and light, I murmured to&#10;myself in Arabic, &#34;Close thine eyes, and while thou sleepest Heaven&#10;will change thy fortune from evil to good.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;One of the natives, who understood this tongue, then came&#10;forward saying:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My brother, be not surprised to see us; this is our land, and&#10;as we came to get water from the river we noticed your raft&#10;floating down it, and one of us swam out and brought you to the&#10;shore. We have waited for your awakening; tell us now whence you&#10;come and where you were going by that dangerous way?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I replied that nothing would please me better than to tell them,&#10;but that I was starving, and would fain eat something first. I was&#10;soon supplied with all I needed, and having satisfied my hunger I&#10;told them faithfully all that had befallen me. They were lost in&#10;wonder at my tale when it was interpreted to them, and said that&#10;adventures so surprising must be related to their king only by the&#10;man to whom they had happened. So, procuring a horse, they mounted&#10;me upon it, and we set out, followed by several strong men carrying&#10;my raft just as it was upon their shoulders. In this order we&#10;marched into the city of Serendib, where the natives presented me&#10;to their king, whom I saluted in the Indian fashion, prostrating&#10;myself at his feet and kissing the ground; but the monarch bade me&#10;rise and sit beside him, asking first what was my name.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I am Sindbad,&#34; I replied, &#34;whom men call `the Sailor,&#39; for I&#10;have voyaged much upon many seas.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And how come you here?&#34; asked the king.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I told my story, concealing nothing, and his surprise and&#10;delight were so great that he ordered my adventures to be written&#10;in letters of gold and laid up in the archives of his kingdom.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Presently my raft was brought in and the bales opened in his&#10;presence, and the king declared that in all his treasury there were&#10;no such rubies and emeralds as those which lay in great heaps&#10;before him. Seeing that he looked at them with interest, I ventured&#10;to say that I myself and all that I had were at his disposal, but&#10;he answered me smiling:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Nay, Sindbad. Heaven forbid that I should covet your riches; I&#10;will rather add to them, for I desire that you shall not leave my&#10;kingdom without some tokens of my good will.&#34; He then commanded his&#10;officers to provide me with a suitable lodging at his expense, and&#10;sent slaves to wait upon me and carry my raft and my bales to my&#10;new dwelling place. You may imagine that I praised his generosity&#10;and gave him grateful thanks, nor did I fail to present myself&#10;daily in his audience chamber, and for the rest of my time I amused&#10;myself in seeing all that was most worthy of attention in the city.&#10;The island of Serendib being situated on the equinoctial line, the&#10;days and nights there are of equal length. The chief city is placed&#10;at the end of a beautiful valley, formed by the highest mountain in&#10;the world, which is in the middle of the island. I had the&#10;curiosity to ascend to its very summit, for this was the place to&#10;which Adam was banished out of Paradise. Here are found rubies and&#10;many precious things, and rare plants grow abundantly, with cedar&#10;trees and cocoa palms. On the seashore and at the mouths of the&#10;rivers the divers seek for pearls, and in some valleys diamonds are&#10;plentiful. After many days I petitioned the king that I might&#10;return to my own country, to which he graciously consented.&#10;Moreover, he loaded me with rich gifts, and when I went to take&#10;leave of him he entrusted me with a royal present and a letter to&#10;the Commander of the Faithful, our sovereign lord, saying, &#34;I pray&#10;you give these to the Caliph Haroun al Raschid, and assure him of&#10;my friendship.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I accepted the charge respectfully, and soon embarked upon the&#10;vessel which the king himself had chosen for me. The king&#39;s letter&#10;was written in blue characters upon a rare and precious skin of&#10;yellowish colour, and these were the words of it: &#34;The King of the&#10;Indies, before whom walk a thousand elephants, who lives in a&#10;palace, of which the roof blazes with a hundred thousand rubies,&#10;and whose treasure house contains twenty thousand diamond crowns,&#10;to the Caliph Haroun al Raschid sends greeting. Though the offering&#10;we present to you is unworthy of your notice, we pray you to accept&#10;it as a mark of the esteem and friendship which we cherish for you,&#10;and of which we gladly send you this token, and we ask of you a&#10;like regard if you deem us worthy of it. Adieu, brother.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The present consisted of a vase carved from a single ruby, six&#10;inches high and as thick as my finger; this was filled with the&#10;choicest pearls, large, and of perfect shape and lustre; secondly,&#10;a huge snake skin, with scales as large as a sequin, which would&#10;preserve from sickness those who slept upon it. Then quantities of&#10;aloes wood, camphor, and pistachio-nuts; and lastly, a beautiful&#10;slave girl, whose robes glittered with precious stones.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;After a long and prosperous voyage we landed at Balsora, and I&#10;made haste to reach Bagdad, and taking the king&#39;s letter I&#10;presented myself at the palace gate, followed by the beautiful&#10;slave, and various members of my own family, bearing the&#10;treasure.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As soon as I had declared my errand I was conducted into the&#10;presence of the Caliph, to whom, after I had made my obeisance, I&#10;gave the letter and the king&#39;s gift, and when he had examined them&#10;he demanded of me whether the Prince of Serendib was really as rich&#10;and powerful as he claimed to be.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Commander of the Faithful,&#34; I replied, again bowing humbly&#10;before him, &#34;I can assure your Majesty that he has in no way&#10;exaggerated his wealth and grandeur. Nothing can equal the&#10;magnificence of his palace. When he goes abroad his throne is&#10;prepared upon the back of an elephant, and on either side of him&#10;ride his ministers, his favourites, and courtiers. On his&#10;elephant&#39;s neck sits an officer, his golden lance in his hand, and&#10;behind him stands another bearing a pillar of gold, at the top of&#10;which is an emerald as long as my hand. A thousand men in cloth of&#10;gold, mounted upon richly caparisoned elephants, go before him, and&#10;as the procession moves onward the officer who guides his elephant&#10;cries aloud, `Behold the mighty monarch, the powerful and valiant&#10;Sultan of the Indies, whose palace is covered with a hundred&#10;thousand rubies, who possesses twenty thousand diamond crowns.&#10;Behold a monarch greater than Solomon and Mihrage in all their&#10;glory!&#39;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Then the one who stands behind the throne answers: &#34;This king,&#10;so great and powerful, must die, must die, must die!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And the first takes up the chant again, `All praise to Him who&#10;lives for evermore.&#39;&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Further, my lord, in Serendib no judge is needed, for to the&#10;king himself his people come for justice.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Caliph was well satisfied with my report.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;From the king&#39;s letter,&#34; said he, &#34;I judged that he was a wise&#10;man. It seems that he is worthy of his people, and his people of&#10;him.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So saying he dismissed me with rich presents, and I returned in&#10;peace to my own house.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When Sindbad had done speaking his guests withdrew, Hindbad&#10;having first received a hundred sequins, but all returned next day&#10;to hear the story of the seventh voyage, Sindbad thus began.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 3, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/208', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('Seventh and Last Voyage'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;After my sixth voyage I was quite determined that I would go to&#10;sea no more. I was now of an age to appreciate a quiet life, and I&#10;had run risks enough. I only wished to end my days in peace. One&#10;day, however, when I was entertaining a number of my friends, I was&#10;told that an officer of the Caliph wished to speak to me, and when&#10;he was admitted he bade me follow him into the presence of Haroun&#10;al Raschid, which I accordingly did. After I had saluted him, the&#10;Caliph said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I have sent for you, Sindbad, because I need your services. I&#10;have chosen you to bear a letter and a gift to the King of Serendib&#10;in return for his message of friendship.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Caliph&#39;s commandment fell upon me like a thunderbolt.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Commander of the Faithful,&#34; I answered, &#34;I am ready to do all&#10;that your Majesty commands, but I humbly pray you to remember that&#10;I am utterly disheartened by the unheard of sufferings I have&#10;undergone. Indeed, I have made a vow never again to leave&#10;Bagdad.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;With this I gave him a long account of some of my strangest&#10;adventures, to which he listened patiently.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I admit,&#34; said he, &#34;that you have indeed had some extraordinary&#10;experiences, but I do not see why they should hinder you from doing&#10;as I wish. You have only to go straight to Serendib and give my&#10;message, then you are free to come back and do as you will. But go&#10;you must; my honour and dignity demand it.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Seeing that there was no help for it, I declared myself willing&#10;to obey; and the Caliph, delighted at having got his own way, gave&#10;me a thousand sequins for the expenses of the voyage. I was soon&#10;ready to start, and taking the letter and the present I embarked at&#10;Balsora, and sailed quickly and safely to Serendib. Here, when I&#10;had disclosed my errand, I was well received, and brought into the&#10;presence of the king, who greeted me with joy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Welcome, Sindbad,&#34; he cried. &#34;I have thought of you often, and&#10;rejoice to see you once more.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;After thanking him for the honour that he did me, I displayed&#10;the Caliph&#39;s gifts. First a bed with complete hangings all cloth of&#10;gold, which cost a thousand sequins, and another like to it of&#10;crimson stuff. Fifty robes of rich embroidery, a hundred of the&#10;finest white linen from Cairo, Suez, Cufa, and Alexandria. Then&#10;more beds of different fashion, and an agate vase carved with the&#10;figure of a man aiming an arrow at a lion, and finally a costly&#10;table, which had once belonged to King Solomon. The King of&#10;Serendib received with satisfaction the assurance of the Caliph&#39;s&#10;friendliness toward him, and now my task being accomplished I was&#10;anxious to depart, but it was some time before the king would think&#10;of letting me go. At last, however, he dismissed me with many&#10;presents, and I lost no time in going on board a ship, which sailed&#10;at once, and for four days all went well. On the fifth day we had&#10;the misfortune to fall in with pirates, who seized our vessel,&#10;killing all who resisted, and making prisoners of those who were&#10;prudent enough to submit at once, of whom I was one. When they had&#10;despoiled us of all we possessed, they forced us to put on vile&#10;raiment, and sailing to a distant island there sold us for slaves.&#10;I fell into the hands of a rich merchant, who took me home with&#10;him, and clothed and fed me well, and after some days sent for me&#10;and questioned me as to what I could do.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I answered that I was a rich merchant who had been captured by&#10;pirates, and therefore I knew no trade.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Tell me,&#34; said he, &#34;can you shoot with a bow?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I replied that this had been one of the pastimes of my youth,&#10;and that doubtless with practice my skill would come back to&#10;me.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Upon this he provided me with a bow and arrows, and mounting me&#10;with him upon his own elephant took the way to a vast forest which&#10;lay far from the town. When we had reached the wildest part of it&#10;we stopped, and my master said to me: &#34;This forest swarms with&#10;elephants. Hide yourself in this great tree, and shoot at all that&#10;pass you. When you have succeeded in killing one come and tell&#10;me.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So saying he gave me a supply of food, and returned to the town,&#10;and I perched myself high up in the tree and kept watch. That night&#10;I saw nothing, but just after sunrise the next morning a large herd&#10;of elephants came crashing and trampling by. I lost no time in&#10;letting fly several arrows, and at last one of the great animals&#10;fell to the ground dead, and the others retreated, leaving me free&#10;to come down from my hiding place and run back to tell my master of&#10;my success, for which I was praised and regaled with good things.&#10;Then we went back to the forest together and dug a mighty trench in&#10;which we buried the elephant I had killed, in order that when it&#10;became a skeleton my master might return and secure its tusks.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For two months I hunted thus, and no day passed without my&#10;securing, an elephant. Of course I did not always station myself in&#10;the same tree, but sometimes in one place, sometimes in another.&#10;One morning as I watched the coming of the elephants I was&#10;surprised to see that, instead of passing the tree I was in, as&#10;they usually did, they paused, and completely surrounded it,&#10;trumpeting horribly, and shaking the very ground with their heavy&#10;tread, and when I saw that their eyes were fixed upon me I was&#10;terrified, and my arrows dropped from my trembling hand. I had&#10;indeed good reason for my terror when, an instant later, the&#10;largest of the animals wound his trunk round the stem of my tree,&#10;and with one mighty effort tore it up by the roots, bringing me to&#10;the ground entangled in its branches. I thought now that my last&#10;hour was surely come; but the huge creature, picking me up gently&#10;enough, set me upon its back, where I clung more dead than alive,&#10;and followed by the whole herd turned and crashed off into the&#10;dense forest. It seemed to me a long time before I was once more&#10;set upon my feet by the elephant, and I stood as if in a dream&#10;watching the herd, which turned and trampled off in another&#10;direction, and were soon hidden in the dense underwood. Then,&#10;recovering myself, I looked about me, and found that I was standing&#10;upon the side of a great hill, strewn as far as I could see on&#10;either hand with bones and tusks of elephants. &#34;This then must be&#10;the elephants&#39; burying place,&#34; I said to myself, &#34;and they must&#10;have brought me here that I might cease to persecute them, seeing&#10;that I want nothing but their tusks, and here lie more than I could&#10;carry away in a lifetime.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Whereupon I turned and made for the city as fast as I could go,&#10;not seeing a single elephant by the way, which convinced me that&#10;they had retired deeper into the forest to leave the way open to&#10;the Ivory Hill, and I did not know how sufficiently to admire their&#10;sagacity. After a day and a night I reached my master&#39;s house, and&#10;was received by him with joyful surprise.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ah! poor Sindbad,&#34; he cried, &#34;I was wondering what could have&#10;become of you. When I went to the forest I found the tree newly&#10;uprooted, and the arrows lying beside it, and I feared I should&#10;never see you again. Pray tell me how you escaped death.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I soon satisfied his curiosity, and the next day we went&#10;together to the Ivory Hill, and he was overjoyed to find that I had&#10;told him nothing but the truth. When we had loaded our elephant&#10;with as many tusks as it could carry and were on our way back to&#10;the city, he said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My brother&#8212;since I can no longer treat as a slave one who has&#10;enriched me thus&#8212;take your liberty and may Heaven prosper you. I&#10;will no longer conceal from you that these wild elephants have&#10;killed numbers of our slaves every year. No matter what good advice&#10;we gave them, they were caught sooner or later. You alone have&#10;escaped the wiles of these animals, therefore you must be under the&#10;special protection of Heaven. Now through you the whole town will&#10;be enriched without further loss of life, therefore you shall not&#10;only receive your liberty, but I will also bestow a fortune upon&#10;you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;To which I replied, &#34;Master, I thank you, and wish you all&#10;prosperity. For myself I only ask liberty to return to my own&#10;country.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It is well,&#34; he answered, &#34;the monsoon will soon bring the&#10;ivory ships hither, then I will send you on your way with somewhat&#10;to pay your passage.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So I stayed with him till the time of the monsoon, and every day&#10;we added to our store of ivory till all his ware-houses were&#10;overflowing with it. By this time the other merchants knew the&#10;secret, but there was enough and to spare for all. When the ships&#10;at last arrived my master himself chose the one in which I was to&#10;sail, and put on board for me a great store of choice provisions,&#10;also ivory in abundance, and all the costliest curiosities of the&#10;country, for which I could not thank him enough, and so we parted.&#10;I left the ship at the first port we came to, not feeling at ease&#10;upon the sea after all that had happened to me by reason of it, and&#10;having disposed of my ivory for much gold, and bought many rare and&#10;costly presents, I loaded my pack animals, and joined a caravan of&#10;merchants. Our journey was long and tedious, but I bore it&#10;patiently, reflecting that at least I had not to fear tempests, nor&#10;pirates, nor serpents, nor any of the other perils from which I had&#10;suffered before, and at length we reached Bagdad. My first care was&#10;to present myself before the Caliph, and give him an account of my&#10;embassy. He assured me that my long absence had disquieted him&#10;much, but he had nevertheless hoped for the best. As to my&#10;adventure among the elephants he heard it with amazement, declaring&#10;that he could not have believed it had not my truthfulness been&#10;well known to him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;By his orders this story and the others I had told him were&#10;written by his scribes in letters of gold, and laid up among his&#10;treasures. I took my leave of him, well satisfied with the honours&#10;and rewards he bestowed upon me; and since that time I have rested&#10;from my labours, and given myself up wholly to my family and my&#10;friends.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Thus Sindbad ended the story of his seventh and last voyage, and&#10;turning to Hindbad he added:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well, my friend, and what do you think now? Have you ever heard&#10;of anyone who has suffered more, or had more narrow escapes than I&#10;have? Is it not just that I should now enjoy a life of ease and&#10;tranquillity?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Hindbad drew near, and kissing his hand respectfully, replied,&#10;&#34;Sir, you have indeed known fearful perils; my troubles have been&#10;nothing compared to yours. Moreover, the generous use you make of&#10;your wealth proves that you deserve it. May you live long and&#10;happily in the enjoyment in it.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Sindbad then gave him a hundred sequins, and hence-forward&#10;counted him among his friends; also he caused him to give up his&#10;profession as a porter, and to eat daily at his table that he might&#10;all his life remember Sindbad the Sailor.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 3, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/208', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('The Little Hunchback'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;In the kingdom of Kashgar, which is, as everybody knows,&#10;situated on the frontiers of Great Tartary, there lived long ago a&#10;tailor and his wife who loved each other very much. One day, when&#10;the tailor was hard at work, a little hunchback came and sat at the&#10;entrance of the shop, and began to sing and play his tambourine.&#10;The tailor was amused with the antics of the fellow, and thought he&#10;would take him home to divert his wife. The hunchback having agreed&#10;to his proposal, the tailor closed his shop and they set off&#10;together.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When they reached the house they found the table ready laid for&#10;supper, and in a very few minutes all three were sitting before a&#10;beautiful fish which the tailor&#39;s wife had cooked with her own&#10;hands. But unluckily, the hunchback happened to swallow a large&#10;bone, and, in spite of all the tailor and his wife could do to help&#10;him, died of suffocation in an instant. Besides being very sorry&#10;for the poor man, the tailor and his wife were very much frightened&#10;on their own account, for if the police came to hear of it the&#10;worthy couple ran the risk of being thrown into prison for wilful&#10;murder. In order to prevent this dreadful calamity they both set&#10;about inventing some plan which would throw suspicion on some one&#10;else, and at last they made up their minds that they could do no&#10;better than select a Jewish doctor who lived close by as the author&#10;of the crime. So the tailor picked up the hunchback by his head&#10;while his wife took his feet and carried him to the doctor&#39;s house.&#10;Then they knocked at the door, which opened straight on to a steep&#10;staircase. A servant soon appeared, feeling her way down the dark&#10;staircase and inquired what they wanted.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Tell your master,&#34; said the tailor, &#34;that we have brought a&#10;very sick man for him to cure; and,&#34; he added, holding out some&#10;money, &#34;give him this in advance, so that he may not feel he is&#10;wasting his time.&#34; The servant remounted the stairs to give the&#10;message to the doctor, and the moment she was out of sight the&#10;tailor and his wife carried the body swiftly after her, propped it&#10;up at the top of the staircase, and ran home as fast as their legs&#10;could carry them.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now the doctor was so delighted at the news of a patient (for he&#10;was young, and had not many of them), that he was transported with&#10;joy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Get a light,&#34; he called to the servant, &#34;and follow me as fast&#10;as you can!&#34; and rushing out of his room he ran towards the&#10;staircase. There he nearly fell over the body of the hunchback, and&#10;without knowing what it was gave it such a kick that it rolled&#10;right to the bottom, and very nearly dragged the doctor after it.&#10;&#34;A light! a light!&#34; he cried again, and when it was brought and he&#10;saw what he had done he was almost beside himself with terror.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Holy Moses!&#34; he exclaimed, &#34;why did I not wait for the light? I&#10;have killed the sick man whom they brought me; and if the sacred&#10;Ass of Esdras does not come to my aid I am lost! It will not be&#10;long before I am led to jail as a murderer.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Agitated though he was, and with reason, the doctor did not&#10;forget to shut the house door, lest some passers-by might chance to&#10;see what had happened. He then took up the corpse and carried it&#10;into his wife&#39;s room, nearly driving her crazy with fright.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It is all over with us!&#34; she wailed, &#34;if we cannot find some&#10;means of getting the body out of the house. Once let the sun rise&#10;and we can hide it no longer! How were you driven to commit such a&#10;terrible crime?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Never mind that,&#34; returned the doctor, &#34;the thing is to find a&#10;way out of it.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For a long while the doctor and his wife continued to turn over&#10;in their minds a way of escape, but could not find any that seemed&#10;good enough. At last the doctor gave it up altogether and resigned&#10;himself to bear the penalty of his misfortune.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But his wife, who had twice his brains, suddenly exclaimed, &#34;I&#10;have thought of something! Let us carry the body on the roof of the&#10;house and lower it down the chimney of our neighbour the&#10;Mussulman.&#34; Now this Mussulman was employed by the Sultan, and&#10;furnished his table with oil and butter. Part of his house was&#10;occupied by a great storeroom, where rats and mice held high&#10;revel.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The doctor jumped at his wife&#39;s plan, and they took up the&#10;hunchback, and passing cords under his armpits they let him down&#10;into the purveyor&#39;s bed-room so gently that he really seemed to be&#10;leaning against the wall. When they felt he was touching the ground&#10;they drew up the cords and left him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Scarcely had they got back to their own house when the purveyor&#10;entered his room. He had spent the evening at a wedding feast, and&#10;had a lantern in his hand. In the dim light it cast he was&#10;astonished to see a man standing in his chimney, but being&#10;naturally courageous he seized a stick and made straight for the&#10;supposed thief. &#34;Ah!&#34; he cried, &#34;so it is you, and not the rats and&#10;mice, who steal my butter. I&#39;ll take care that you don&#39;t want to&#10;come back!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So saying he struck him several hard blows. The corpse fell on&#10;the floor, but the man only redoubled his blows, till at length it&#10;occurred to him it was odd that the thief should lie so still and&#10;make no resistance. Then, finding he was quite dead, a cold fear&#10;took possession of him. &#34;Wretch that I am,&#34; said he, &#34;I have&#10;murdered a man. Ah, my revenge has gone too far. Without tho help&#10;of Allah I am undone! Cursed be the goods which have led me to my&#10;ruin.&#34; And already he felt the rope round his neck.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But when he had got over the first shock he began to think of&#10;some way out of the difficulty, and seizing the hunchback in his&#10;arms he carried him out into the street, and leaning him against&#10;the wall of a shop he stole back to his own house, without once&#10;looking behind him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A few minutes before the sun rose, a rich Christian merchant,&#10;who supplied the palace with all sorts of necessaries, left his&#10;house, after a night of feasting, to go to the bath. Though he was&#10;very drunk, he was yet sober enough to know that the dawn was at&#10;hand, and that all good Mussulmen would shortly be going to prayer.&#10;So he hastened his steps lest he should meet some one on his way to&#10;the mosque, who, seeing his condition, would send him to prison as&#10;a drunkard. In his haste he jostled against the hunchback, who fell&#10;heavily upon him, and the merchant, thinking he was being attacked&#10;by a thief, knocked him down with one blow of his fist. He then&#10;called loudly for help, beating the fallen man all the while.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The chief policeman of the quarter came running up, and found a&#10;Christian ill-treating a Mussulman. &#34;What are you doing?&#34; he asked&#10;indignantly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;He tried to rob me,&#34; replied the merchant, &#34;and very nearly&#10;choked me.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well, you have had your revenge,&#34; said the man, catching hold&#10;of his arm. &#34;Come, be off with you!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As he spoke he held out his hand to the hunchback to help him&#10;up, but the hunchback never moved. &#34;Oho!&#34; he went on, looking&#10;closer, &#34;so this is the way a Christian has the impudence to treat&#10;a Mussulman!&#34; and seizing the merchant in a firm grasp he took him&#10;to the inspector of police, who threw him into prison till the&#10;judge should be out of bed and ready to attend to his case. All&#10;this brought the merchant to his senses, but the more he thought of&#10;it the less he could understand how the hunchback could have died&#10;merely from the blows he had received.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The merchant was still pondering on this subject when he was&#10;summoned before the chief of police and questioned about his crime,&#10;which he could not deny. As the hunchback was one of the Sultan&#39;s&#10;private jesters, the chief of police resolved to defer sentence of&#10;death until he had consulted his master. He went to the palace to&#10;demand an audience, and told his story to the Sultan, who only&#10;answered,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;There is no pardon for a Christian who kills a Mussulman. Do&#10;your duty.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So the chief of police ordered a gallows to be erected, and sent&#10;criers to proclaim in every street in the city that a Christian was&#10;to be hanged that day for having killed a Mussulman.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When all was ready the merchant was brought from prison and led&#10;to the foot of the gallows. The executioner knotted the cord firmly&#10;round the unfortunate man&#39;s neck and was just about to swing him&#10;into the air, when the Sultan&#39;s purveyor dashed through the crowd,&#10;and cried, panting, to the hangman,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Stop, stop, don&#39;t be in such a hurry. It was not he who did the&#10;murder, it was I.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The chief of police, who was present to see that everything was&#10;in order, put several questions to the purveyor, who told him the&#10;whole story of the death of the hunchback, and how he had carried&#10;the body to the place where it had been found by the Christian&#10;merchant.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You are going,&#34; he said to the chief of police, &#34;to kill an&#10;innocent man, for it is impossible that he should have murdered a&#10;creature who was dead already. It is bad enough for me to have&#10;slain a Mussulman without having it on my conscience that a&#10;Christian who is guiltless should suffer through my fault.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now the purveyor&#39;s speech had been made in a loud voice, and was&#10;heard by all the crowd, and even if he had wished it, the chief of&#10;police could not have escaped setting the merchant free.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Loose the cords from the Christian&#39;s neck,&#34; he commanded,&#10;turning to the executioner, &#34;and hang this man in his place, seeing&#10;that by his own confession he is the murderer.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The hangman did as he was bid, and was tying the cord firmly,&#10;when he was stopped by the voice of the Jewish doctor beseeching&#10;him to pause, for he had something very important to say. When he&#10;had fought his way through the crowd and reached the chief of&#10;police,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Worshipful sir,&#34; he began, &#34;this Mussulman whom you desire to&#10;hang is unworthy of death; I alone am guilty. Last night a man and&#10;a woman who were strangers to me knocked at my door, bringing with&#10;them a patient for me to cure. The servant opened it, but having no&#10;light was hardly able to make out their faces, though she readily&#10;agreed to wake me and to hand me the fee for my services. While she&#10;was telling me her story they seem to have carried the sick man to&#10;the top of the staircase and then left him there. I jumped up in a&#10;hurry without waiting for a lantern, and in the darkness I fell&#10;against something, which tumbled headlong down the stairs and never&#10;stopped till it reached the bottom. When I examined the body I&#10;found it was quite dead, and the corpse was that of a hunchback&#10;Mussulman. Terrified at what we had done, my wife and I took the&#10;body on the roof and let it down the chimney of our neighbour the&#10;purveyor, whom you were just about to hang. The purveyor, finding&#10;him in his room, naturally thought he was a thief, and struck him&#10;such a blow that the man fell down and lay motionless on the floor.&#10;Stooping to examine him, and finding him stone dead, the purveyor&#10;supposed that the man had died from the blow he had received; but&#10;of course this was a mistake, as you will see from my account, and&#10;I only am the murderer; and although I am innocent of any wish to&#10;commit a crime, I must suffer for it all the same, or else have the&#10;blood of two Musselmans on my conscience. Therefore send away this&#10;man, I pray you, and let me take his place, as it is I who am&#10;guilty.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;On hearing the declaration of the Jewish doctor, the chief of&#10;police commanded that he should be led to the gallows, and the&#10;Sultan&#39;s purveyor go free. The cord was placed round the Jew&#39;s&#10;neck, and his feet had already ceased to touch the ground when the&#10;voice of the tailor was heard beseeching the executioner to pause&#10;one moment and to listen to what he had to say.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh, my lord,&#34; he cried, turning to the chief of police, &#34;how&#10;nearly have you caused the death of three innocent people! But if&#10;you will only have the patience to listen to my tale, you shall&#10;know who is the real culprit. If some one has to suffer, it must be&#10;me! Yesterday, at dusk, I was working in my shop with a light heart&#10;when the little hunchback, who was more than half drunk, came and&#10;sat in the doorway. He sang me several songs, and then I invited&#10;him to finish the evening at my house. He accepted my invitation,&#10;and we went away together. At supper I helped him to a slice of&#10;fish, but in eating it a bone stuck in his throat, and in spite of&#10;all we could do he died in a few minutes. We felt deeply sorry for&#10;his death, but fearing lest we should be held responsible, we&#10;carried the corpse to the house of the Jewish doctor. I knocked,&#10;and desired the servant to beg her master to come down as fast as&#10;possible and see a sick man whom we had brought for him to cure;&#10;and in order to hasten his movements I placed a piece of money in&#10;her hand as the doctor&#39;s fee. Directly she had disappeared I&#10;dragged the body to the top of the stairs, and then hurried away&#10;with my wife back to our house. In descending the stairs the doctor&#10;accidentally knocked over the corpse, and finding him dead believed&#10;that he himself was the murderer. But now you know the truth set&#10;him free, and let me die in his stead.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The chief of police and the crowd of spectators were lost in&#10;astonishment at the strange events to which the death of the&#10;hunchback had given rise.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Loosen the Jewish doctor,&#34; said he to the hangman, &#34;and string&#10;up the tailor instead, since he has made confession of his crime.&#10;Really, one cannot deny that this is a very singular story, and it&#10;deserves to be written in letters of gold.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The executioner speedily untied the knots which confined the&#10;doctor, and was passing the cord round the neck of the tailor, when&#10;the Sultan of Kashgar, who had missed his jester, happened to make&#10;inquiry of his officers as to what had become of him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Sire,&#34; replied they, &#34;the hunchback having drunk more than was&#10;good for him, escaped from the palace and was seen wandering about&#10;the town, where this morning he was found dead. A man was arrested&#10;for having caused his death, and held in custody till a gallows was&#10;erected. At the moment that he was about to suffer punishment,&#10;first one man arrived, and then another, each accusing themselves&#10;of the murder, and this went on for a long time, and at the present&#10;instant the chief of police is engaged in questioning a man who&#10;declares that he alone is the true assassin.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Sultan of Kashgar no sooner heard these words than he&#10;ordered an usher to go to the chief of police and to bring all the&#10;persons concerned in the hunchback&#39;s death, together with the&#10;corpse, that he wished to see once again. The usher hastened on his&#10;errand, but was only just in time, for the tailor was positively&#10;swinging in the air, when his voice fell upon the silence of the&#10;crowd, commanding the hangman to cut down the body. The hangman,&#10;recognising the usher as one of the king&#39;s servants, cut down the&#10;tailor, and the usher, seeing the man was safe, sought the chief of&#10;police and gave him the Sultan&#39;s message. Accordingly, the chief of&#10;police at once set out for the palace, taking with him the tailor,&#10;the doctor, the purveyor, and the merchant, who bore the dead&#10;hunchback on their shoulders.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When the procession reached the palace the chief of police&#10;prostrated himself at the feet of the Sultan, and related all that&#10;he knew of the matter. The Sultan was so much struck by the&#10;circumstances that he ordered his private historian to write down&#10;an exact account of what had passed, so that in the years to come&#10;the miraculous escape of the four men who had thought themselves&#10;murderers might never be forgotten.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Sultan asked everybody concerned in the hunchback&#39;s affair&#10;to tell him their stories. Among others was a prating barber, whose&#10;tale of one of his brothers follows.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 3, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/208', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('Story of the Barber&#39;s Fifth Brother'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;As long as our father lived Alnaschar was very idle. Instead of&#10;working for his bread he was not ashamed to ask for it every&#10;evening, and to support himself next day on what he had received&#10;the night before. When our father died, worn out by age, he only&#10;left seven hundred silver drachmas to be divided amongst us, which&#10;made one hundred for each son. Alnaschar, who had never possessed&#10;so much money in his life, was quite puzzled to know what to do&#10;with it. After reflecting upon the matter for some time he decided&#10;to lay it out on glasses, bottles, and things of that sort, which&#10;he would buy from a wholesale merchant. Having bought his stock he&#10;next proceeded to look out for a small shop in a good position,&#10;where he sat down at the open door, his wares being piled up in an&#10;uncovered basket in front of him, waiting for a customer among the&#10;passers-by.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In this attitude he remained seated, his eyes fixed on the&#10;basket, but his thoughts far away. Unknown to himself he began to&#10;talk out loud, and a tailor, whose shop was next door to his, heard&#10;quite plainly what he was saying.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;This basket,&#34; said Alnaschar to himself, &#34;has cost me a hundred&#10;drachmas&#8212; all that I possess in the world. Now in selling the&#10;contents piece by piece I shall turn two hundred, and these&#10;hundreds I shall again lay out in glass, which will produce four&#10;hundred. By this means I shall in course of time make four thousand&#10;drachmas, which will easily double themselves. When I have got ten&#10;thousand I will give up the glass trade and become a jeweller, and&#10;devote all my time to trading in pearls, diamonds, and other&#10;precious stones. At last, having all the wealth that heart can&#10;desire, I will buy a beautiful country house, with horses and&#10;slaves, and then I will lead a merry life and entertain my friends.&#10;At my feasts I will send for musicians and dancers from the&#10;neighbouring town to amuse my guests. In spite of my riches I shall&#10;not, however, give up trade till I have amassed a capital of a&#10;hundred thousand drachmas, when, having become a man of much&#10;consideration, I shall request the hand of the grand-vizir&#39;s&#10;daughter, taking care to inform the worthy father that I have heard&#10;favourable reports of her beauty and wit, and that I will pay down&#10;on our wedding day 3 thousand gold pieces. Should the vizir refuse&#10;my proposal, which after all is hardly to be expected, I will seize&#10;him by the beard and drag him to my house.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When I shall have married his daughter I will give her ten of&#10;the best eunuchs that can be found for her service. Then I shall&#10;put on my most gorgeous robes, and mounted on a horse with a saddle&#10;of fine gold, and its trappings blazing with diamonds, followed by&#10;a train of slaves, I shall present myself at the house of the&#10;grand-vizir, the people casting down their eyes and bowing low as I&#10;pass along. At the foot of the grand-vizir&#39;s staircase I shall&#10;dismount, and while my servants stand in a row to right and left I&#10;shall ascend the stairs, at the head of which the grand-vizir will&#10;be waiting to receive me. He will then embrace me as his&#10;son-in-law, and giving me his seat will place himself below me.&#10;This being done (as I have every reason to expect), two of my&#10;servants will enter, each bearing a purse containing a thousand&#10;pieces of gold. One of these I shall present to him saying, &#34;Here&#10;are the thousand gold pieces that I offered for your daughter&#39;s&#10;hand, and here,&#34; I shall continue, holding out the second purse,&#10;&#34;are another thousand to show you that I am a man who is better&#10;than his word.&#34; After hearing of such generosity the world will&#10;talk of nothing else.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I shall return home with the same pomp as I set out, and my wife&#10;will send an officer to compliment me on my visit to her father,&#10;and I shall confer on the officer the honour of a rich dress and a&#10;handsome gift. Should she send one to me I shall refuse it and&#10;dismiss the bearer. I shall never allow my wife to leave her rooms&#10;on any pretext whatever without my permission, and my visits to her&#10;will be marked by all the ceremony calculated to inspire respect.&#10;No establishment will be better ordered than mine, and I shall take&#10;care always to be dressed in a manner suitable to my position. In&#10;the evening, when we retire to our apartments, I shall sit in the&#10;place of honour, where I shall assume a grand demeanour and speak&#10;little, gazing straight before me, and when my wife, lovely as the&#10;full moon, stands humbly in front of my chair I shall pretend not&#10;to see her. Then her women will say to me, &#34;Respected lord and&#10;master, your wife and slave is before you waiting to be noticed.&#10;She is mortified that you never deign to look her way; she is tired&#10;of standing so long. Beg her, we pray you, to be seated.&#34; Of course&#10;I shall give no signs of even hearing this speech, which will vex&#10;them mightily. They will throw themselves at my feet with&#10;lamentations, and at length I will raise my head and throw a&#10;careless glance at her, then I shall go back to my former attitude.&#10;The women will think that I am displeased at my wife&#39;s dress and&#10;will lead her away to put on a finer one, and I on my side shall&#10;replace the one I am wearing with another yet more splendid. They&#10;will then return to the charge, but this time it will take much&#10;longer before they persuade me even to look at my wife. It is as&#10;well to begin on my wedding-day as I mean to go on for the rest of&#10;our lives.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The next day she will complain to her mother of the way she has&#10;been treated, which will fill my heart with joy. Her mother will&#10;come to seek me, and, kissing my hands with respect, will say, &#34;My&#10;lord&#34; (for she could not dare to risk my anger by using the&#10;familiar title of &#34;son-in-law&#34;), &#34;My lord, do not, I implore you,&#10;refuse to look upon my daughter or to approach her. She only lives&#10;to please you, and loves you with all her soul.&#34; But I shall pay no&#10;more heed to my mother-in-law&#39;s words than I did to those of the&#10;women. Again she will beseech me to listen to her entreaties,&#10;throwing herself this time at my feet, but all to no purpose. Then,&#10;putting a glass of wine into my wife&#39;s hand, she will say to her,&#10;&#34;There, present that to him yourself, he cannot have the cruelty to&#10;reject anything offered by so beautiful a hand,&#34; and my wife will&#10;take it and offer it to me tremblingly with tears in her eyes, but&#10;I shall look in the other direction. This will cause her to weep&#10;still more, and she will hold out the glass crying, &#34;Adorable&#10;husband, never shall I cease my prayers till you have done me the&#10;favour to drink.&#34; Sick of her importunities, these words will goad&#10;me to fury. I shall dart an angry look at her and give her a sharp&#10;blow on the cheek, at the same time giving her a kick so violent&#10;that she will stagger across the room and fall on to the sofa.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My brother,&#34; pursued the barber, &#34;was so much absorbed in his&#10;dreams that he actually did give a kick with his foot, which&#10;unluckily hit the basket of glass. It fell into the street and was&#10;instantly broken into a thousand pieces.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;His neighbour the tailor, who had been listening to his visions,&#10;broke into a loud fit of laughter as he saw this sight.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Wretched man!&#34; he cried, &#34;you ought to die of shame at behaving&#10;so to a young wife who has done nothing to you. You must be a brute&#10;for her tears and prayers not to touch your heart. If I were the&#10;grand-vizir I would order you a hundred blows from a bullock whip,&#10;and would have you led round the town accompanied by a herald who&#10;should proclaim your crimes.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The accident, so fatal to all his profits, had restored my&#10;brother to his senses, and seeing that the mischief had been caused&#10;by his own insufferable pride, he rent his clothes and tore his&#10;hair, and lamented himself so loudly that the passers-by stopped to&#10;listen. It was a Friday, so these were more numerous than usual.&#10;Some pitied Alnaschar, others only laughed at him, but the vanity&#10;which had gone to his head had disappeared with his basket of&#10;glass, and he was loudly bewailing his folly when a lady, evidently&#10;a person of consideration, rode by on a mule. She stopped and&#10;inquired what was the matter, and why the man wept. They told her&#10;that he was a poor man who had laid out all his money on this&#10;basket of glass, which was now broken. On hearing the cause of&#10;these loud wails the lady turned to her attendant and said to him,&#10;&#34;Give him whatever you have got with you.&#34; The man obeyed, and&#10;placed in my brother&#39;s hands a purse containing five hundred pieces&#10;of gold. Alnaschar almost died of joy on receiving it. He blessed&#10;the lady a thousand times, and, shutting up his shop where he had&#10;no longer anything to do, he returned home.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He was still absorbed in contemplating his good fortune, when a&#10;knock came to his door, and on opening it he found an old woman&#10;standing outside.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My son,&#34; she said, &#34;I have a favour to ask of you. It is the&#10;hour of prayer and I have not yet washed myself. Let me, I beg you,&#10;enter your house, and give me water.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;My brother, although the old woman was a stranger to him, did&#10;not hesitate to do as she wished. He gave her a vessel of water and&#10;then went back to his place and his thoughts, and with his mind&#10;busy over his last adventure, he put his gold into a long and&#10;narrow purse, which he could easily carry in his belt. During this&#10;time the old woman was busy over her prayers, and when she had&#10;finished she came and prostrated herself twice before my brother,&#10;and then rising called down endless blessings on his head.&#10;Observing her shabby clothes, my brother thought that her gratitude&#10;was in reality a hint that he should give her some money to buy&#10;some new ones, so he held out two pieces of gold. The old woman&#10;started back in surprise as if she had received an insult. &#34;Good&#10;heavens!&#34; she exclaimed, &#34;what is the meaning of this? Is it&#10;possible that you take me, my lord, for one of those miserable&#10;creatures who force their way into houses to beg for alms? Take&#10;back your money. I am thankful to say I do not need it, for I&#10;belong to a beautiful lady who is very rich and gives me everything&#10;I want.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;My brother was not clever enough to detect that the old woman&#10;had merely refused the two pieces of money he had offered her in&#10;order to get more, but he inquired if she could procure him the&#10;pleasure of seeing this lady.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Willingly,&#34; she replied; &#34;and she will be charmed to marry you,&#10;and to make you the master of all her wealth. So pick up your money&#10;and follow me.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Delighted at the thought that he had found so easily both a&#10;fortune and a beautiful wife, my brother asked no more questions,&#10;but concealing his purse, with the money the lady had given him, in&#10;the folds of his dress, he set out joyfully with his guide.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;They walked for some distance till the old woman stopped at a&#10;large house, where she knocked. The door was opened by a young&#10;Greek slave, and the old woman led my brother across a well-paved&#10;court into a well-furnished hall. Here she left him to inform her&#10;mistress of his presence, and as the day was hot he flung himself&#10;on a pile of cushions and took off his heavy turban. In a few&#10;minutes there entered a lady, and my brother perceived at the first&#10;glance that she was even more beautiful and more richly dressed&#10;than he had expected. He rose from his seat, but the lady signed to&#10;him to sit down again and placed herself beside him. After the&#10;usual compliments had passed between them she said, &#34;We are not&#10;comfortable here, let us go into another room,&#34; and passing into a&#10;smaller chamber, apparently communicating with no other, she&#10;continued to talk to him for some time. Then rising hastily she&#10;left him, saying, &#34;Stay where you are, I will come back in a&#10;moment.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He waited as he was told, but instead of the lady there entered&#10;a huge black slave with a sword in his hand. Approaching my brother&#10;with an angry countenance he exclaimed, &#34;What business have you&#10;here?&#34; His voice and manner were so terrific that Alnaschar had not&#10;strength to reply, and allowed his gold to be taken from him, and&#10;even sabre cuts to be inflicted on him without making any&#10;resistance. As soon as he was let go, he sank on the ground&#10;powerless to move, though he still had possession of his senses.&#10;Thinking he was dead, the black ordered the Greek slave to bring&#10;him some salt, and between them they rubbed it into his wounds,&#10;thus giving him acute agony, though he had the presence of mind to&#10;give no sign of life. They then left him, and their place was taken&#10;by the old woman, who dragged him to a trapdoor and threw him down&#10;into a vault filled with the bodies of murdered men.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At first the violence of his fall caused him to lose&#10;consciousness, but luckily the salt which had been rubbed into his&#10;wounds had by its smarting preserved his life, and little by little&#10;he regained his strength. At the end of two days he lifted the&#10;trapdoor during the night and hid himself in the courtyard till&#10;daybreak, when he saw the old woman leave the house in search of&#10;more prey. Luckily she did not observe him, and when she was out of&#10;sight he stole from this nest of assassins and took refuge in my&#10;house.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I dressed his wounds and tended him carefully, and when a month&#10;had passed he was as well as ever. His one thought was how to be&#10;revenged on that wicked old hag, and for this purpose he had a&#10;purse made large enough to contain five hundred gold pieces, but&#10;filled it instead with bits of glass. This he tied round him with&#10;his sash, and, disguising himself as an old woman, he took a sabre,&#10;which he hid under his dress.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;One morning as he was hobbling through the streets he met his&#10;old enemy prowling to see if she could find anyone to decoy. He&#10;went up to her and, imitating the voice of a woman, he said, &#34;Do&#10;you happen to have a pair of scales you could lend me? I have just&#10;come from Persia and have brought with me five hundred gold pieces,&#10;and I am anxious to see if they are the proper weight.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Good woman,&#34; replied the old hag, &#34;you could not have asked&#10;anyone better. My son is a money-changer, and if you will follow me&#10;he will weigh them for you himself. Only we must be quick or he&#10;will have gone to his shop.&#34; So saying she led the way to the same&#10;house as before, and the door was opened by the same Greek&#10;slave.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Again my brother was left in the hall, and the pretended son&#10;appeared under the form of the black slave. &#34;Miserable crone,&#34; he&#10;said to my brother, &#34;get up and come with me,&#34; and turned to lead&#10;the way to the place of murder. Alnaschar rose too, and drawing the&#10;sabre from under his dress dealt the black such a blow on his neck&#10;that his head was severed from his body. My brother picked up the&#10;head with one hand, and seizing the body with the other dragged it&#10;to the vault, when he threw it in and sent the head after it. The&#10;Greek slave, supposing that all had passed as usual, shortly&#10;arrived with the basin of salt, but when she beheld Alnaschar with&#10;the sabre in his hand she let the basin fall and turned to fly. My&#10;brother, however, was too quick for her, and in another instant her&#10;head was rolling from her shoulders. The noise brought the old&#10;woman running to see what was the matter, and he seized her before&#10;she had time to escape. &#34;Wretch!&#34; he cried, &#34;do you know me?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Who are you, my lord?&#34; she replied trembling all over. &#34;I have&#10;never seen you before.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I am he whose house you entered to offer your hypocritical&#10;prayers. Don&#39;t you remember now?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She flung herself on her knees to implore mercy, but he cut her&#10;in four pieces.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;There remained only the lady, who was quite ignorant of all that&#10;was taking place around her. He sought her through the house, and&#10;when at last he found her, she nearly fainted with terror at the&#10;sight of him. She begged hard for life, which he was generous&#10;enough to give her, but he bade her to tell him how she had got&#10;into partnership with the abominable creatures he had just put to&#10;death.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I was once,&#34; replied she, &#34;the wife of an honest merchant, and&#10;that old woman, whose wickedness I did not know, used occasionally&#10;to visit me. &#34;Madam,&#34; she said to me one day, &#34;we have a grand&#10;wedding at our house to-day. If you would do us the honour to be&#10;present, I am sure you would enjoy yourself.&#34; I allowed myself to&#10;be persuaded, put on my richest dress, and took a purse with a&#10;hundred pieces of gold. Once inside the doors I was kept by force&#10;by that dreadful black, and it is now three years that I have been&#10;here, to my great grief.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That horrible black must have amassed great wealth, remarked my&#10;brother.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Such wealth,&#34; returned she, &#34;that if you succeed in carrying it&#10;all away it will make you rich for ever. Come and let us see how&#10;much there is.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She led Alnaschar into a chamber filled with coffers packed with&#10;gold, which he gazed at with an admiration he was powerless to&#10;conceal. &#34;Go,&#34; she said, &#34;and bring men to carry them away.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;My brother did not wait to be told twice, and hurried out into&#10;the streets, where he soon collected ten men. They all came back to&#10;the house, but what was his surprise to find the door open, and the&#10;room with the chests of gold quite empty. The lady had been&#10;cleverer than himself, and had made the best use of her time.&#10;However, he tried to console himself by removing all the beautiful&#10;furniture, which more than made up for the five hundred gold pieces&#10;he had lost.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Unluckily, on leaving the house, he forgot to lock the door, and&#10;the neighbours, finding the place empty, informed the police, who&#10;next morning arrested Alnaschar as a thief. My brother tried to&#10;bribe them to let him off, but far from listening to him they tied&#10;his hands, and forced him to walk between them to the presence of&#10;the judge. When they had explained to the official the cause of&#10;complaint, he asked Alnaschar where he had obtained all the&#10;furniture that he had taken to his house the day before.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Sir,&#34; replied Alnaschar, &#34;I am ready to tell you the whole&#10;story, but give, I pray you, your word, that I shall run no risk of&#10;punishment.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That I promise,&#34; said the judge. So my brother began at the&#10;beginning and related all his adventures, and how he had avenged&#10;himself on those who had betrayed him. As to the furniture, he&#10;entreated the judge at least to allow him to keep part to make up&#10;for the five hundred pieces of gold which had been stolen from&#10;him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The judge, however, would say nothing about this, and lost no&#10;time in sending men to fetch away all that Alnaschar had taken from&#10;the house. When everything had been moved and placed under his roof&#10;he ordered my brother to leave the town and never more to enter it&#10;on peril of his life, fearing that if he returned he might seek&#10;justice from the Caliph. Alnaschar obeyed, and was on his way to a&#10;neighbouring city when he fell in with a band of robbers, who&#10;stripped him of his clothes and left him naked by the roadside.&#10;Hearing of his plight, I hurried after him to console him for his&#10;misfortunes, and to dress him in my best robe. I then brought him&#10;back disguised, under cover of night, to my house, where I have&#10;since given him all the care I bestow on my other brothers.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 3, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/208', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('The Story of the Barber&#39;s Sixth&#10;Brother'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;There now remains for me to relate to you the story of my sixth&#10;brother, whose name was Schacabac. Like the rest of us, he&#10;inherited a hundred silver drachmas from our father, which he&#10;thought was a large fortune, but through ill-luck, he soon lost it&#10;all, and was driven to beg. As he had a smooth tongue and good&#10;manners, he really did very well in his new profession, and he&#10;devoted himself specially to making friends with the servants in&#10;big houses, so as to gain access to their masters.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;One day he was passing a splendid mansion, with a crowd of&#10;servants lounging in the courtyard. He thought that from the&#10;appearance of the house it might yield him a rich harvest, so he&#10;entered and inquired to whom it belonged.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My good man, where do you come from?&#34; replied the servant.&#10;&#34;Can&#39;t you see for yourself that it can belong to nobody but a&#10;Barmecide?&#34; for the Barmecides were famed for their liberality and&#10;generosity. My brother, hearing this, asked the porters, of whom&#10;there were several, if they would give him alms. They did not&#10;refuse, but told him politely to go in, and speak to the master&#10;himself.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;My brother thanked them for their courtesy and entered the&#10;building, which was so large that it took him some time to reach&#10;the apartments of the Barmecide. At last, in a room richly&#10;decorated with paintings, he saw an old man with a long white&#10;beard, sitting on a sofa, who received him with such kindness that&#10;my brother was emboldened to make his petition.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My lord,&#34; he said, &#34;you behold in me a poor man who only lives&#10;by the help of persons as rich and as generous as you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Before he could proceed further, he was stopped by the&#10;astonishment shown by the Barmecide. &#34;Is it possible,&#34; he cried,&#10;&#34;that while I am in Bagdad, a man like you should be starving? That&#10;is a state of things that must at once be put an end to! Never&#10;shall it be said that I have abandoned you, and I am sure that you,&#10;on your part, will never abandon me.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My lord,&#34; answered my brother, &#34;I swear that I have not broken&#10;my fast this whole day.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What, you are dying of hunger?&#34; exclaimed the Barmecide. &#34;Here,&#10;slave; bring water, that we may wash our hands before meat!&#34; No&#10;slave appeared, but my brother remarked that the Barmecide did not&#10;fail to rub his hands as if the water had been poured over&#10;them.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then he said to my brother, &#34;Why don&#39;t you wash your hands too?&#34;&#10;and Schacabac, supposing that it was a joke on the part of the&#10;Barmecide (though he could see none himself), drew near, and&#10;imitated his motion.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When the Barmecide had done rubbing his hands, he raised his&#10;voice, and cried, &#34;Set food before us at once, we are very hungry.&#34;&#10;No food was brought, but the Barmecide pretended to help himself&#10;from a dish, and carry a morsel to his mouth, saying as he did so,&#10;&#34;Eat, my friend, eat, I entreat. Help yourself as freely as if you&#10;were at home! For a starving man, you seem to have a very small&#10;appetite.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Excuse me, my lord,&#34; replied Schacabac, imitating his gestures&#10;as before, &#34;I really am not losing time, and I do full justice to&#10;the repast.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;How do you like this bread?&#34; asked the Barmecide. &#34;I find it&#10;particularly good myself.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh, my lord,&#34; answered my brother, who beheld neither meat nor&#10;bread, &#34;never have I tasted anything so delicious.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Eat as much as you want,&#34; said the Barmecide. &#34;I bought the&#10;woman who makes it for five hundred pieces of gold, so that I might&#10;never be without it.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;After ordering a variety of dishes (which never came) to be&#10;placed on the table, and discussing the merits of each one, the&#10;Barmecide declared that having dined so well, they would now&#10;proceed to take their wine. To this my brother at first objected,&#10;declaring that it was forbidden; but on the Barmecide insisting&#10;that it was out of the question that he should drink by himself, he&#10;consented to take a little. The Barmecide, however, pretended to&#10;fill their glasses so often, that my brother feigned that the wine&#10;had gone into his head, and struck the Barmecide such a blow on the&#10;head, that he fell to the ground. Indeed, he raised his hand to&#10;strike him a second time, when the Barmecide cried out that he was&#10;mad, upon which my brother controlled himself, and apologised and&#10;protested that it was all the fault of the wine he had drunk. At&#10;this the Barmecide, instead of being angry, began to laugh, and&#10;embraced him heartily. &#34;I have long been seeking,&#34; he exclaimed, &#34;a&#10;man of your description, and henceforth my house shall be yours.&#10;You have had the good grace to fall in with my humour, and to&#10;pretend to eat and to drink when nothing was there. Now you shall&#10;be rewarded by a really good supper.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then he clapped his hands, and all the dishes were brought that&#10;they had tasted in imagination before and during the repast, slaves&#10;sang and played on various instruments. All the while Schacabac was&#10;treated by the Barmecide as a familiar friend, and dressed in a&#10;garment out of his own wardrobe.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Twenty years passed by, and my brother was still living with the&#10;Barmecide, looking after his house, and managing his affairs. At&#10;the end of that time his generous benefactor died without heirs, so&#10;all his possessions went to the prince. They even despoiled my&#10;brother of those that rightly belonged to him, and he, now as poor&#10;as he had ever been in his life, decided to cast in his lot with a&#10;caravan of pilgrims who were on their way to Mecca. Unluckily, the&#10;caravan was attacked and pillaged by the Bedouins, and the pilgrims&#10;were taken prisoners. My brother became the slave of a man who beat&#10;him daily, hoping to drive him to offer a ransom, although, as&#10;Schacabac pointed out, it was quite useless trouble, as his&#10;relations were as poor as himself. At length the Bedouin grew tired&#10;of tormenting, and sent him on a camel to the top of a high barren&#10;mountain, where he left him to take his chance. A passing caravan,&#10;on its way to Bagdad, told me where he was to be found, and I&#10;hurried to his rescue, and brought him in a deplorable condition&#10;back to the town.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;This,&#34;&#8212;continued the barber,&#8212;&#34;is the tale I related to the&#10;Caliph, who, when I had finished, burst into fits of laughter.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well were you called `the Silent,&#39;&#34; said he; &#34;no name was ever&#10;better deserved. But for reasons of my own, which it is not&#10;necessary to mention, I desire you to leave the town, and never to&#10;come back.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I had of course no choice but to obey, and travelled about for&#10;several years until I heard of the death of the Caliph, when I&#10;hastily returned to Bagdad, only to find that all my brothers were&#10;dead. It was at this time that I rendered to the young cripple the&#10;important service of which you have heard, and for which, as you&#10;know, he showed such profound ingratitude, that he preferred rather&#10;to leave Bagdad than to run the risk of seeing me. I sought him&#10;long from place to place, but it was only to-day, when I expected&#10;it least, that I came across him, as much irritated with me as&#10;ever&#34;&#8212; So saying the tailor went on to relate the story of the lame&#10;man and the barber, which has already been told.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;When the barber,&#34; he continued, &#34;had finished his tale, we came&#10;to the conclusion that the young man had been right, when he had&#10;accused him of being a great chatter-box. However, we wished to&#10;keep him with us, and share our feast, and we remained at table&#10;till the hour of afternoon prayer. Then the company broke up, and I&#10;went back to work in my shop.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It was during this interval that the little hunchback, half&#10;drunk already, presented himself before me, singing and playing on&#10;his drum. I took him home, to amuse my wife, and she invited him to&#10;supper. While eating some fish, a bone got into his throat, and in&#10;spite of all we could do, he died shortly. It was all so sudden&#10;that we lost our heads, and in order to divert suspicion from&#10;ourselves, we carried the body to the house of a Jewish physician.&#10;He placed it in the chamber of the purveyor, and the purveyor&#10;propped it up in the street, where it was thought to have been&#10;killed by the merchant.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;This, Sire, is the story which I was obliged to tell to satisfy&#10;your highness. It is now for you to say if we deserve mercy or&#10;punishment; life or death?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Sultan of Kashgar listened with an air of pleasure which&#10;filled the tailor and his friends with hope. &#34;I must confess,&#34; he&#10;exclaimed, &#34;that I am much more interested in the stories of the&#10;barber and his brothers, and of the lame man, than in that of my&#10;own jester. But before I allow you all four to return to your own&#10;homes, and have the corpse of the hunchback properly buried, I&#10;should like to see this barber who has earned your pardon. And as&#10;he is in this town, let an usher go with you at once in search of&#10;him.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The usher and the tailor soon returned, bringing with them an&#10;old man who must have been at least ninety years of age. &#34;O Silent&#10;One,&#34; said the Sultan, &#34;I am told that you know many strange&#10;stories. Will you tell some of them to me?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Never mind my stories for the present,&#34; replied the barber,&#10;&#34;but will your Highness graciously be pleased to explain why this&#10;Jew, this Christian, and this Mussulman, as well as this dead body,&#10;are all here?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What business is that of yours?&#34; asked the Sultan with a smile;&#10;but seeing that the barber had some reasons for his question, he&#10;commanded that the tale of the hunch-back should be told him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It is certainly most surprising,&#34; cried he, when he had heard&#10;it all, &#34;but I should like to examine the body.&#34; He then knelt&#10;down, and took the head on his knees, looking at it attentively.&#10;Suddenly he burst into such loud laughter that he fell right&#10;backwards, and when he had recovered himself enough to speak, he&#10;turned to the Sultan. &#34;The man is no more dead than I am,&#34; he said;&#10;&#34;watch me.&#34; As he spoke he drew a small case of medicines from his&#10;pocket and rubbed the neck of the hunchback with some ointment made&#10;of balsam. Next he opened the dead man&#39;s mouth, and by the help of&#10;a pair of pincers drew the bone from his throat. At this the&#10;hunch-back sneezed, stretched himself and opened his eyes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Sultan and all those who saw this operation did not know&#10;which to admire most, the constitution of the hunchback who had&#10;apparently been dead for a whole night and most of one day, or the&#10;skill of the barber, whom everyone now began to look upon as a&#10;great man. His Highness desired that the history of the hunchback&#10;should be written down, and placed in the archives beside that of&#10;the barber, so that they might be associated in people&#39;s minds to&#10;the end of time. And he did not stop there; for in order to wipe&#10;out the memory of what they had undergone, he commanded that the&#10;tailor, the doctor, the purveyor and the merchant, should each be&#10;clothed in his presence with a robe from his own wardrobe before&#10;they returned home. As for the barber, he bestowed on him a large&#10;pension, and kept him near his own person.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 3, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/208', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('The Adventures of Prince Camaralzaman and&#10;the Princess Badoura'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;Some twenty days&#39; sail from the coast of Persia lies the isle of&#10;the children of Khaledan. The island is divided into several&#10;provinces, in each of which are large flourishing towns, and the&#10;whole forms an important kingdom. It was governed in former days by&#10;a king named Schahzaman, who, with good right, considered himself&#10;one of the most peaceful, prosperous, and fortunate monarchs on the&#10;earth. In fact, he had but one grievance, which was that none of&#10;his four wives had given him an heir.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;This distressed him so greatly that one day he confided his&#10;grief to the grand-vizir, who, being a wise counsellor, said: &#34;Such&#10;matters are indeed beyond human aid. Allah alone can grant your&#10;desire, and I should advise you, sire, to send large gifts to those&#10;holy men who spend their lives in prayer, and to beg for their&#10;intercessions. Who knows whether their petitions may not be&#10;answered!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The king took his vizir&#39;s advice, and the result of so many&#10;prayers for an heir to the throne was that a son was born to him&#10;the following year.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Schahzaman sent noble gifts as thank offerings to all the&#10;mosques and religious houses, and great rejoicings were celebrated&#10;in honour of the birth of the little prince, who was so beautiful&#10;that he was named Camaralzaman, or &#34;Moon of the Century.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Prince Camaralzaman was brought up with extreme care by an&#10;excellent governor and all the cleverest teachers, and he did such&#10;credit to them that when he was grown up, a more charming and&#10;accomplished young man was not to be found. Whilst he was still a&#10;youth the king, his father, who loved him dearly, had some thoughts&#10;of abdicating in his favour. As usual he talked over his plans with&#10;his grand-vizir, who, though he did not approve the idea, would not&#10;state all his objections.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Sire,&#34; he replied, &#34;the prince is still very young for the&#10;cares of state. Your Majesty fears his growing idle and careless,&#10;and doubtless you are right. But how would it be if he were first&#10;to marry? This would attach him to his home, and your Majesty might&#10;give him a share in your counsels, so that he might gradually learn&#10;how to wear a crown, which you can give up to him whenever you find&#10;him capable of wearing it.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The vizir&#39;s advice once more struck the king as being good, and&#10;he sent for his son, who lost no time in obeying the summons, and&#10;standing respectfully with downcast eyes before the king asked for&#10;his commands.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I have sent for you,&#34; said the king, &#34;to say that I wish you to&#10;marry. What do you think about it?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The prince was so much overcome by these words that he remained&#10;silent for some time. At length he said: &#34;Sire, I beg you to pardon&#10;me if I am unable to reply as you might wish. I certainly did not&#10;expect such a proposal as I am still so young, and I confess that&#10;the idea of marrying is very distasteful to me. Possibly I may not&#10;always be in this mind, but I certainly feel that it will require&#10;some time to induce me to take the step which your Majesty&#10;desires.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;This answer greatly distressed the king, who was sincerely&#10;grieved by his objection to marriage. However he would not have&#10;recourse to extreme measures, so he said: &#34;I do not wish to force&#10;you; I will give you time to reflect, but remember that such a step&#10;is necessary, for a prince such as you who will some day be called&#10;to rule over a great kingdom.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;From this time Prince Camaralzaman was admitted to the royal&#10;council, and the king showed him every mark of favour.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At the end of a year the king took his son aside, and said:&#10;&#34;Well, my son, have you changed your mind on the subject of&#10;marriage, or do you still refuse to obey my wish?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The prince was less surprised but no less firm than on the&#10;former occasion, and begged his father not to press the subject,&#10;adding that it was quite useless to urge him any longer.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;This answer much distressed the king, who again confided his&#10;trouble to his vizir.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I have followed your advice,&#34; he said; &#34;but Camaralzaman&#10;declines to marry, and is more obstinate than ever.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Sire,&#34; replied the vizir, &#34;much is gained by patience, and your&#10;Majesty might regret any violence. Why not wait another year and&#10;then inform the Prince in the midst of the assembled council that&#10;the good of the state demands his marriage? He cannot possibly&#10;refuse again before so distinguished an assemblage, and in our&#10;immediate presence.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Sultan ardently desired to see his son married at once, but&#10;he yielded to the vizir&#39;s arguments and decided to wait. He then&#10;visited the prince&#39;s mother, and after telling her of his&#10;disappointment and of the further respite he had given his son, he&#10;added: &#34;I know that Camaralzaman confides more in you than he does&#10;in me. Pray speak very seriously to him on this subject, and make&#10;him realize that he will most seriously displease me if he remains&#10;obstinate, and that he will certainly regret the measures I shall&#10;be obliged to take to enforce my will.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So the first time the Sultana Fatima saw her son she told him&#10;she had heard of his refusal to marry, adding how distressed she&#10;felt that he should have vexed his father so much. She asked what&#10;reasons he could have for his objections to obey.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Madam,&#34; replied the prince, &#34;I make no doubt that there are as&#10;many good, virtuous, sweet, and amiable women as there are others&#10;very much the reverse. Would that all were like you! But what&#10;revolts me is the idea of marrying a woman without knowing anything&#10;at all about her. My father will ask the hand of the daughter of&#10;some neighbouring sovereign, who will give his consent to our&#10;union. Be she fair or frightful, clever or stupid, good or bad, I&#10;must marry her, and am left no choice in the matter. How am I to&#10;know that she will not be proud, passionate, contemptuous, and&#10;recklessly extravagant, or that her disposition will in any way&#10;suit mine?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But, my son,&#34; urged Fatima, &#34;you surely do not wish to be the&#10;last of a race which has reigned so long and so gloriously over&#10;this kingdom?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Madam,&#34; said the prince, &#34;I have no wish to survive the king,&#10;my father, but should I do so I will try to reign in such a manner&#10;as may be considered worthy of my predecessors.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;These and similar conversations proved to the Sultan how useless&#10;it was to argue with his son, and the year elapsed without bringing&#10;any change in the prince&#39;s ideas.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At length a day came when the Sultan summoned him before the&#10;council, and there informed him that not only his own wishes but&#10;the good of the empire demanded his marriage, and desired him to&#10;give his answer before the assembled ministers.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At this Camaralzaman grew so angry and spoke with so much heat&#10;that the king, naturally irritated at being opposed by his son in&#10;full council, ordered the prince to be arrested and locked up in an&#10;old tower, where he had nothing but a very little furniture, a few&#10;books, and a single slave to wait on him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Camaralzaman, pleased to be free to enjoy his books, showed&#10;himself very indifferent to his sentence.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When night came he washed himself, performed his devotions, and,&#10;having read some pages of the Koran, lay down on a couch, without&#10;putting out the light near him, and was soon asleep.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now there was a deep well in the tower in which Prince&#10;Camaralzaman was imprisoned, and this well was a favourite resort&#10;of the fairy Maimoune, daughter of Damriat, chief of a legion of&#10;genii. Towards midnight Maimoune floated lightly up from the well,&#10;intending, according to her usual habit, to roam about the upper&#10;world as curiosity or accident might prompt.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The light in the prince&#39;s room surprised her, and without&#10;disturbing the slave, who slept across the threshold, she entered&#10;the room, and approaching the bed was still more astonished to find&#10;it occupied.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The prince lay with his face half hidden by the coverlet.&#10;Maimoune lifted it a little and beheld the most beautiful youth she&#10;had ever seen.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What a marvel of beauty he must be when his eyes are open!&#34; she&#10;thought. &#34;What can he have done to deserve to be treated like&#10;this?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She could not weary gazing at Camaralzaman, but at length,&#10;having softly kissed his brow and each cheek, she replaced the&#10;coverlet and resumed her flight through the air.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As she entered the middle region she heard the sound of great&#10;wings coming towards her, and shortly met one of the race of bad&#10;genii. This genie, whose name was Danhasch, recognised Maimoune&#10;with terror, for he knew the supremacy which her goodness gave her&#10;over him. He would gladly have avoided her altogether, but they&#10;were so near that he must either be prepared to fight or yield to&#10;her, so he at once addressed her in a conciliatory tone:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Good Maimoune, swear to me by Allah to do me no harm, and on my&#10;side I will promise not to injure you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Accursed genie!&#34; replied Maimoune, &#34;what harm can you do me?&#10;But I will grant your power and give the promise you ask. And now&#10;tell me what you have seen and done to-night.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Fair lady,&#34; said Danhasch, &#34;you meet me at the right moment to&#10;hear something really interesting. I must tell you that I come from&#10;the furthest end of China, which is one of the largest and most&#10;powerful kingdoms in the world. The present king has one only&#10;daughter, who is so perfectly lovely that neither you, nor I, nor&#10;any other creature could find adequate terms in which to describe&#10;her marvellous charms. You must therefore picture to yourself the&#10;most perfect features, joined to a brilliant and delicate&#10;complexion, and an enchanting expression, and even then imagination&#10;will fall short of the reality.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The king, her father, has carefully shielded this treasure from&#10;the vulgar gaze, and has taken every precaution to keep her from&#10;the sight of everyone except the happy mortal he may choose to be&#10;her husband. But in order to give her variety in her confinement he&#10;has built her seven palaces such as have never been seen before.&#10;The first palace is entirely composed of rock crystal, the second&#10;of bronze, the third of fine steel, the fourth of another and more&#10;precious species of bronze, the fifth of touchstone, the sixth of&#10;silver, and the seventh of solid gold. They are all most&#10;sumptuously furnished, whilst the gardens surrounding them are laid&#10;out with exquisite taste. In fact, neither trouble nor cost has&#10;been spared to make this retreat agreeable to the princess. The&#10;report of her wonderful beauty has spread far and wide, and many&#10;powerful kings have sent embassies to ask her hand in marriage. The&#10;king has always received these embassies graciously, but says that&#10;he will never oblige the princess to marry against her will, and as&#10;she regularly declines each fresh proposal, the envoys have had to&#10;leave as disappointed in the result of their missions as they were&#10;gratified by their magnificent receptions.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Sire,&#34; said the princess to her father, &#34;you wish me to marry,&#10;and I know you desire to please me, for which I am very grateful.&#10;But, indeed, I have no inclination to change my state, for where&#10;could I find so happy a life amidst so many beautiful and&#10;delightful surroundings? I feel that I could never be as happy with&#10;any husband as I am here, and I beg you not to press one on&#10;me.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;At last an embassy came from a king so rich and powerful that&#10;the King of China felt constrained to urge this suit on his&#10;daughter. He told her how important such an alliance would be, and&#10;pressed her to consent. In fact, he pressed her so persistingly&#10;that the princess at length lost her temper and quite forgot the&#10;respect due to her father. &#34;Sire,&#34; cried she angrily, &#34;do not speak&#10;further of this or any other marriage or I will plunge this dagger&#10;in my breast and so escape from all these importunities.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The king of China was extremely indignant with his daughter and&#10;replied: &#34;You have lost your senses and you must be treated&#10;accordingly.&#34; So he had her shut in one set of rooms in one of her&#10;palaces, and only allowed her ten old women, of whom her nurse was&#10;the head, to wait on her and keep her company. He next sent letters&#10;to all the kings who had sued for the princess&#39;s hand, begging they&#10;would think of her no longer, as she was quite insane, and he&#10;desired his various envoys to make it known that anyone who could&#10;cure her should have her to wife.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Fair Maimoune,&#34; continued Danhasch, &#34;this is the present state&#10;of affairs. I never pass a day without going to gaze on this&#10;incomparable beauty, and I am sure that if you would only accompany&#10;me you would think the sight well worth the trouble, and own that&#10;you never saw such loveliness before.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The fairy only answered with a peal of laughter, and when at&#10;length she had control of her voice she cried, &#34;Oh, come, you are&#10;making game of me! I thought you had something really interesting&#10;to tell me instead of raving about some unknown damsel. What would&#10;you say if you could see the prince I have just been looking at and&#10;whose beauty is really transcendent? That is something worth&#10;talking about, you would certainly quite lose your head.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Charming Maimoune,&#34; asked Danhasch, &#34;may I inquire who and what&#10;is the prince of whom you speak?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Know,&#34; replied Maimoune, &#34;that he is in much the same case as&#10;your princess. The king, his father, wanted to force him to marry,&#10;and on the prince&#39;s refusal to obey he has been imprisoned in an&#10;old tower where I have just seen him.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I don&#39;t like to contradict a lady,&#34; said Danhasch, &#34;but you&#10;must really permit me to doubt any mortal being as beautiful as my&#10;princess.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Hold your tongue,&#34; cried Maimoune. &#34;I repeat that is&#10;impossible.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well, I don&#39;t wish to seem obstinate,&#34; replied Danhasch, &#34;the&#10;best plan to test the truth of what I say will be for you to let me&#10;take you to see the princess for yourself.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;There is no need for that,&#34; retorted Maimoune; &#34;we can satisfy&#10;ourselves in another way. Bring your princess here and lay her down&#10;beside my prince. We can then compare them at leisure, and decide&#10;which is in the right.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Danhasch readily consented, and after having the tower where the&#10;prince was confined pointed out to him, and making a wager with&#10;Maimoune as to the result of the comparison, he flew off to China&#10;to fetch the princess.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In an incredibly short time Danhasch returned, bearing the&#10;sleeping princess. Maimoune led him to the prince&#39;s room, and the&#10;rival beauty was placed beside him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When the prince and princess lay thus side by side, an animated&#10;dispute as to their respective charms arose between the fairy and&#10;the genius. Danhasch began by saying:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Now you see that my princess is more beautiful than your&#10;prince. Can you doubt any longer?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Doubt! Of course I do!&#34; exclaimed Maimoune. &#34;Why, you must be&#10;blind not to see how much my prince excels your princess. I do not&#10;deny that your princess is very handsome, but only look and you&#10;must own that I am in the right.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;There is no need for me to look longer,&#34; said Danhasch, &#34;my&#10;first impression will remain the same; but of course, charming&#10;Maimoune, I am ready to yield to you if you insist on it.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;By no means,&#34; replied Maimoune. &#34;I have no idea of being under&#10;any obligation to an accursed genius like you. I refer the matter&#10;to an umpire, and shall expect you to submit to his verdict.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Danhasch readily agreed, and on Maimoune striking the floor with&#10;her foot it opened, and a hideous, hump-backed, lame, squinting&#10;genius, with six horns on his head, hands like claws, emerged. As&#10;soon as he beheld Maimoune he threw himself at her feet and asked&#10;her commands.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Rise, Caschcasch,&#34; said she. &#34;I summoned you to judge between&#10;me and Danhasch. Glance at that couch, and say without any&#10;partiality whether you think the youth or the maiden lying there&#10;the more beautiful.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Caschcasch looked at the prince and princess with every token of&#10;surprise and admiration. At length, having gazed long without being&#10;able to come to a decision, he said&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Madam, I must confess that I should deceive you were I to&#10;declare one to be handsomer than the other. There seems to me only&#10;one way in which to decide the matter, and that is to wake one&#10;after the other and judge which of them expresses the greater&#10;admiration for the other.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;This advice pleased Maimoune and Danhasch, and the fairy at once&#10;transformed herself into the shape of a gnat and settling on&#10;Camaralzaman&#39;s throat stung him so sharply that he awoke. As he did&#10;so his eyes fell on the Princess of China. Surprised at finding a&#10;lady so near him, he raised himself on one arm to look at her. The&#10;youth and beauty of the princess at once awoke a feeling to which&#10;his heart had as yet been a stranger, and he could not restrain his&#10;delight.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What loveliness! What charms! Oh, my heart, my soul!&#34; he&#10;exclaimed, as he kissed her forehead, her eyes and mouth in a way&#10;which would certainly have roused her had not the genie&#39;s&#10;enchantments kept her asleep.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;How, fair lady!&#34; he cried, &#34;you do not wake at the signs of&#10;Camaralzaman&#39;s love? Be you who you may, he is not unworthy of&#10;you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It then suddenly occurred to him, that perhaps this was the&#10;bride his father had destined for him, and that the King had&#10;probably had her placed in this room in order to see how far&#10;Camaralzaman&#39;s aversion to marriage would withstand her charms.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;At all events,&#34; he thought, &#34;I will take this ring as a&#10;remembrance of her.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So saying he drew off a fine ring which the princess wore on her&#10;finger, and replaced it by one of his own. After which he lay down&#10;again and was soon fast asleep.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then Danhasch, in his turn, took the form of a gnat and bit the&#10;princess on her lip.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She started up, and was not a little amazed at seeing a young&#10;man beside her. From surprise she soon passed to admiration, and&#10;then to delight on perceiving how handsome and fascinating he&#10;was.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why,&#34; cried she, &#34;was it you my father wished me to marry? How&#10;unlucky that I did not know sooner! I should not have made him so&#10;angry. But wake up! wake up! for I know I shall love you with all&#10;my heart.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So saying she shook Camaralzaman so violently that nothing but&#10;the spells of Maimoune could have prevented his waking.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh!&#34; cried the princess. &#34;Why are you so drowsy?&#34; So saying she&#10;took his hand and noticed her own ring on his finger, which made&#10;her wonder still more. But as he still remained in a profound&#10;slumber she pressed a kiss on his cheek and soon fell fast asleep&#10;too.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then Maimoune turning to the genie said: &#34;Well, are you&#10;satisfied that my prince surpasses your princess? Another time pray&#10;believe me when I assert anything.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then turning to Caschcasch: &#34;My thanks to you, and now do you&#10;and Danhasch bear the princess back to her own home.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The two genii hastened to obey, and Maimoune returned to her&#10;well.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;On waking next morning the first thing Prince Camaralzaman did&#10;was to look round for the lovely lady he had seen at night, and the&#10;next to question the slave who waited on him about her. But the&#10;slave persisted so strongly that he knew nothing of any lady, and&#10;still less of how she got into the tower, that the prince lost all&#10;patience, and after giving him a good beating tied a rope round him&#10;and ducked him in the well till the unfortunate man cried out that&#10;he would tell everything. Then the prince drew him up all dripping&#10;wet, but the slave begged leave to change his clothes first, and as&#10;soon as the prince consented hurried off just as he was to the&#10;palace. Here he found the king talking to the grand-vizir of all&#10;the anxiety his son had caused him. The slave was admitted at once&#10;and cried:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Alas, Sire! I bring sad news to your Majesty. There can be no&#10;doubt that the prince has completely lost his senses. He declares&#10;that he saw a lady sleeping on his couch last night, and the state&#10;you see me in proves how violent contradiction makes him.&#34; He then&#10;gave a minute account of all the prince had said and done.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The king, much moved, begged the vizir to examine into this new&#10;misfortune, and the latter at once went to the tower, where he&#10;found the prince quietly reading a book. After the first exchange&#10;of greetings the vizir said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I feel really very angry with your slave for alarming his&#10;Majesty by the news he brought him.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What news?&#34; asked the prince.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ah!&#34; replied the vizir, &#34;something absurd, I feel sure, seeing&#10;how I find you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Most likely,&#34; said the prince; &#34;but now that you are here I am&#10;glad of the opportunity to ask you where is the lady who slept in&#10;this room last night?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The grand-vizir felt beside himself at this question.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Prince!&#34; he exclaimed, &#34;how would it be possible for any man,&#10;much less a woman, to enter this room at night without walking over&#10;your slave on the threshold? Pray consider the matter, and you will&#10;realise that you have been deeply impressed by some dream.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But the prince angrily insisted on knowing who and where the&#10;lady was, and was not to be persuaded by all the vizir&#39;s&#10;protestations to the contrary that the plot had not been one of his&#10;making. At last, losing patience, he seized the vizir by the beard&#10;and loaded him with blows.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Stop, Prince,&#34; cried the unhappy vizir, &#34;stay and hear what I&#10;have to say.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The prince, whose arm was getting tired, paused.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I confess, Prince,&#34; said the vizir, &#34;that there is some&#10;foundation for what you say. But you know well that a minister has&#10;to carry out his master&#39;s orders. Allow me to go and to take to the&#10;king any message you may choose to send.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Very well,&#34; said the prince; &#34;then go and tell him that I&#10;consent to marry the lady whom he sent or brought here last night.&#10;Be quick and bring me back his answer.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The vizir bowed to the ground and hastened to leave the room and&#10;tower.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well,&#34; asked the king as soon as he appeared, &#34;and how did you&#10;find my son?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Alas, sire,&#34; was the reply, &#34;the slave&#39;s report is only too&#10;true!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He then gave an exact account of his interview with Camaralzaman&#10;and of the prince&#39;s fury when told that it was not possible for any&#10;lady to have entered his room, and of the treatment he himself had&#10;received. The king, much distressed, determined to clear up the&#10;matter himself, and, ordering the vizir to follow him, set out to&#10;visit his son.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The prince received his father with profound respect, and the&#10;king, making him sit beside him, asked him several questions, to&#10;which Camaralzaman replied with much good sense. At last the king&#10;said: &#34;My son, pray tell me about the lady who, it is said, was in&#10;your room last night.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Sire,&#34; replied the prince, &#34;pray do not increase my distress in&#10;this matter, but rather make me happy by giving her to me in&#10;marriage. However much I may have objected to matrimony formerly,&#10;the sight of this lovely girl has overcome all my prejudices, and I&#10;will gratefully receive her from your hands.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The king was almost speechless on hearing his son, but after a&#10;time assured him most solemnly that he knew nothing whatever about&#10;the lady in question, and had not connived at her appearance. He&#10;then desired the prince to relate the whole story to him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Camaralzaman did so at great length, showed the ring, and&#10;implored his father to help to find the bride he so ardently&#10;desired.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;After all you tell me,&#34; remarked the king, &#34;I can no longer&#10;doubt your word; but how and whence the lady came, or why she&#10;should have stayed so short a time I cannot imagine. The whole&#10;affair is indeed mysterious. Come, my dear son, let us wait&#10;together for happier days.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So saying the king took Camaralzaman by the hand and led him&#10;back to the palace, where the prince took to his bed and gave&#10;himself up to despair, and the king shutting himself up with his&#10;son entirely neglected the affairs of state.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The prime minister, who was the only person admitted, felt it&#10;his duty at last to tell the king how much the court and all the&#10;people complained of his seclusion, and how bad it was for the&#10;nation. He urged the sultan to remove with the prince to a lovely&#10;little island close by, whence he could easily attend public&#10;audiences, and where the charming scenery and fine air would do the&#10;invalid so much good as to enable him to bear his father&#39;s&#10;occasional absence.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The king approved the plan, and as soon as the castle on the&#10;island could be prepared for their reception he and the prince&#10;arrived there, Schahzaman never leaving his son except for the&#10;prescribed public audiences twice a week.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Whilst all this was happening in the capital of Schahzaman the&#10;two genii had carefully borne the Princess of China back to her own&#10;palace and replaced her in bed. On waking next morning she first&#10;turned from one side to another and then, finding herself alone,&#10;called loudly for her women.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Tell me,&#34; she cried, &#34;where is the young man I love so dearly,&#10;and who slept near me last night?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Princess,&#34; exclaimed the nurse, &#34;we cannot tell what you allude&#10;to without more explanation.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why,&#34; continued the princess, &#34;the most charming and beautiful&#10;young man lay sleeping beside me last night. I did my utmost to&#10;wake him, but in vain.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Your Royal Highness wishes to make game of us,&#34; said the nurse.&#10;&#34;Is it your pleasure to rise?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I am quite in earnest,&#34; persisted the princess, &#34;and I want to&#10;know where he is.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But, Princess,&#34; expostulated the nurse, &#34;we left you quite&#10;alone last night, and we have seen no one enter your room since&#10;then.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At this the princess lost all patience, and taking the nurse by&#10;her hair she boxed her ears soundly, crying out: &#34;You shall tell&#10;me, you old witch, or I&#39;ll kill you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The nurse had no little trouble in escaping, and hurried off to&#10;the queen, to whom she related the whole story with tears in her&#10;eyes.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You see, madam,&#34; she concluded, &#34;that the princess must be out&#10;of her mind. If only you will come and see her, you will be able to&#10;judge for yourself.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The queen hurried to her daughter&#39;s apartments, and after&#10;tenderly embracing her, asked her why she had treated her nurse so&#10;badly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Madam,&#34; said the princess, &#34;I perceive that your Majesty wishes&#10;to make game of me, but I can assure you that I will never marry&#10;anyone except the charming young man whom I saw last night. You&#10;must know where he is, so pray send for him.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The queen was much surprised by these words, but when she&#10;declared that she knew nothing whatever of the matter the princess&#10;lost all respect, and answered that if she were not allowed to&#10;marry as she wished she should kill herself, and it was in vain&#10;that the queen tried to pacify her and bring her to reason.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The king himself came to hear the rights of the matter, but the&#10;princess only persisted in her story, and as a proof showed the&#10;ring on her finger. The king hardly knew what to make of it all,&#10;but ended by thinking that his daughter was more crazy than ever,&#10;and without further argument he had her placed in still closer&#10;confinement, with only her nurse to wait on her and a powerful&#10;guard to keep the door.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then he assembled his council, and having told them the sad&#10;state of things, added: &#34;If any of you can succeed in curing the&#10;princess, I will give her to him in marriage, and he shall be my&#10;heir.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;An elderly emir present, fired with the desire to possess a&#10;young and lovely wife and to rule over a great kingdom, offered to&#10;try the magic arts with which he was acquainted.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You are welcome to try,&#34; said the king, &#34;but I make one&#10;condition, which is, that should you fail you will lose your&#10;life.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The emir accepted the condition, and the king led him to the&#10;princess, who, veiling her face, remarked, &#34;I am surprised, sire,&#10;that you should bring an unknown man into my presence.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You need not be shocked,&#34; said the king; &#34;this is one of my&#10;emirs who asks your hand in marriage.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Sire,&#34; replied the princess, &#34;this is not the one you gave me&#10;before and whose ring I wear. Permit me to say that I can accept no&#10;other.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The emir, who had expected to hear the princess talk nonsense,&#10;finding how calm and reasonable she was, assured the king that he&#10;could not venture to undertake a cure, but placed his head at his&#10;Majesty&#39;s disposal, on which the justly irritated monarch promptly&#10;had it cut off.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;This was the first of many suitors for the princess whose&#10;inability to cure her cost them their lives.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now it happened that after things had been going on in this way&#10;for some time the nurse&#39;s son Marzavan returned from his travels.&#10;He had been in many countries and learnt many things, including&#10;astrology. Needless to say that one of the first things his mother&#10;told him was the sad condition of the princess, his foster-sister.&#10;Marzavan asked if she could not manage to let him see the princess&#10;without the king&#39;s knowledge.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;After some consideration his mother consented, and even&#10;persuaded the eunuch on guard to make no objection to Marzavan&#39;s&#10;entering the royal apartment.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The princess was delighted to see her foster-brother again, and&#10;after some conversation she confided to him all her history and the&#10;cause of her imprisonment.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Marzavan listened with downcast eyes and the utmost attention.&#10;When she had finished speaking he said,&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;If what you tell me, Princess, is indeed the case, I do not&#10;despair of finding comfort for you. Take patience yet a little&#10;longer. I will set out at once to explore other countries, and when&#10;you hear of my return be sure that he for whom you sigh is not far&#10;off.&#34; So saying, he took his leave and started next morning on his&#10;travels.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Marzavan journeyed from city to city and from one island and&#10;province to another, and wherever he went he heard people talk of&#10;the strange story of the Princess Badoura, as the Princess of China&#10;was named.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;After four months he reached a large populous seaport town named&#10;Torf, and here he heard no more of the Princess Badoura but a great&#10;deal of Prince Camaralzaman, who was reported ill, and whose story&#10;sounded very similar to that of the Princess Badoura.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Marzavan was rejoiced, and set out at once for Prince&#10;Camaralzaman&#39;s residence. The ship on which he embarked had a&#10;prosperous voyage till she got within sight of the capital of King&#10;Schahzaman, but when just about to enter the harbour she suddenly&#10;struck on a rock, and foundered within sight of the palace where&#10;the prince was living with his father and the grand-vizir.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Marzavan, who swam well, threw himself into the sea and managed&#10;to land close to the palace, where he was kindly received, and&#10;after having a change of clothing given him was brought before the&#10;grand-vizir. The vizir was at once attracted by the young man&#39;s&#10;superior air and intelligent conversation, and perceiving that he&#10;had gained much experience in the course of his travels, he said,&#10;&#34;Ah, how I wish you had learnt some secret which might enable you&#10;to cure a malady which has plunged this court into affliction for&#10;some time past!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Marzavan replied that if he knew what the illness was he might&#10;possibly be able to suggest a remedy, on which the vizir related to&#10;him the whole history of Prince Camaralzaman.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;On hearing this Marzavan rejoiced inwardly, for he felt sure&#10;that he had at last discovered the object of the Princess Badoura&#39;s&#10;infatuation. However, he said nothing, but begged to be allowed to&#10;see the prince.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;On entering the royal apartment the first thing which struck him&#10;was the prince himself, who lay stretched out on his bed with his&#10;eyes closed. The king sat near him, but, without paying any regard&#10;to his presence, Marzavan exclaimed, &#34;Heavens! what a striking&#10;likeness!&#34; And, indeed, there was a good deal of resemblance&#10;between the features of Camaralzaman and those of the Princess of&#10;China.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;These words caused the prince to open his eyes with languid&#10;curiosity, and Marzavan seized this moment to pay him his&#10;compliments, contriving at the same time to express the condition&#10;of the Princess of China in terms unintelligible, indeed, to the&#10;Sultan and his vizir, but which left the prince in no doubt that&#10;his visitor could give him some welcome information.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The prince begged his father to allow him the favour of a&#10;private interview with Marzavan, and the king was only too pleased&#10;to find his son taking an interest in anyone or anything. As soon&#10;as they were left alone Marzavan told the prince the story of the&#10;Princess Badoura and her sufferings, adding, &#34;I am convinced that&#10;you alone can cure her; but before starting on so long a journey&#10;you must be well and strong, so do your best to recover as quickly&#10;as may be.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;These words produced a great effect on the prince, who was so&#10;much cheered by the hopes held out that he declared he felt able to&#10;get up and be dressed. The king was overjoyed at the result of&#10;Marzavan&#39;s interview, and ordered public rejoicings in honour of&#10;the prince&#39;s recovery.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Before long the prince was quite restored to his original state&#10;of health, and as soon as he felt himself really strong he took&#10;Marzavan aside and said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Now is the time to perform your promise. I am so impatient to&#10;see my beloved princess once more that I am sure I shall fall ill&#10;again if we do not start soon. The one obstacle is my father&#39;s&#10;tender care of me, for, as you may have noticed, he cannot bear me&#10;out of his sight.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Prince,&#34; replied Marzavan, &#34;I have already thought over the&#10;matter, and this is what seems to me the best plan. You have not&#10;been out of doors since my arrival. Ask the king&#39;s permission to go&#10;with me for two or three days&#39; hunting, and when he has given leave&#10;order two good horses to be held ready for each of us. Leave all&#10;the rest to me.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Next day the prince seized a favourable opportunity for making&#10;his request, and the king gladly granted it on condition that only&#10;one night should be spent out for fear of too great fatigue after&#10;such a long illness.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Next morning Prince Camaralzaman and Marzavan were off betimes,&#10;attended by two grooms leading the two extra horses. They hunted a&#10;little by the way, but took care to get as far from the towns as&#10;possible. At night-fall they reached an inn, where they supped and&#10;slept till midnight. Then Marzavan awoke and roused the prince&#10;without disturbing anyone else. He begged the prince to give him&#10;the coat he had been wearing and to put on another which they had&#10;brought with them. They mounted their second horses, and Marzavan&#10;led one of the grooms&#39; horses by the bridle.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;By daybreak our travellers found themselves where four cross&#10;roads met in the middle of the forest. Here Marzavan begged the&#10;prince to wait for him, and leading the groom&#39;s horse into a dense&#10;part of the wood he cut its throat, dipped the prince&#39;s coat in its&#10;blood, and having rejoined the prince threw the coat on the ground&#10;where the roads parted.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In answer to Camaralzaman&#39;s inquiries as to the reason for this,&#10;Marzavan replied that the only chance they had of continuing their&#10;journey was to divert attention by creating the idea of the&#10;prince&#39;s death. &#34;Your father will doubtless be plunged in the&#10;deepest grief,&#34; he went on, &#34;but his joy at your return will be all&#10;the greater.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The prince and his companion now continued their journey by land&#10;and sea, and as they had brought plenty of money to defray their&#10;expenses they met with no needless delays. At length they reached&#10;the capital of China, where they spent three days in a suitable&#10;lodging to recover from their fatigues.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;During this time Marzavan had an astrologer&#39;s dress prepared for&#10;the prince. They then went to the baths, after which the prince put&#10;on the astrologer&#39;s robe and was conducted within sight of the&#10;king&#39;s palace by Marzavan, who left him there and went to consult&#10;his mother, the princess&#39;s nurse.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Meantime the prince, according to Marzavan&#39;s instructions,&#10;advanced close to the palace gates and there proclaimed aloud:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I am an astrologer and I come to restore health to the Princess&#10;Badoura, daughter of the high and mighty King of China, on the&#10;conditions laid down by His Majesty of marrying her should I&#10;succeed, or of losing my life if I fail.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was some little time since anyone had presented himself to&#10;run the terrible risk involved in attempting to cure the princess,&#10;and a crowd soon gathered round the prince. On perceiving his&#10;youth, good looks, and distinguished bearing, everyone felt pity&#10;for him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What are you thinking of, sir,&#34; exclaimed some; &#34;why expose&#10;yourself to certain death? Are not the heads you see exposed on the&#10;town wall sufficient warning? For mercy&#39;s sake give up this mad&#10;idea and retire whilst you can.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But the prince remained firm, and only repeated his cry with&#10;greater assurance, to the horror of the crowd.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;He is resolved to die!&#34; they cried; &#34;may heaven have pity on&#10;him!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Camaralzaman now called out for the third time, and at last the&#10;grand-vizir himself came out and fetched him in.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The prime minister led the prince to the king, who was much&#10;struck by the noble air of this new adventurer, and felt such pity&#10;for the fate so evidently in store for him, that he tried to&#10;persuade the young man to renounce his project.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But Camaralzaman politely yet firmly persisted in his&#10;intentions, and at length the king desired the eunuch who had the&#10;guard of the princess&#39;s apartments to conduct the astrologer to her&#10;presence.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The eunuch led the way through long passages, and Camaralzaman&#10;followed rapidly, in haste to reach the object of his desires. At&#10;last they came to a large hall which was the ante-room to the&#10;princess&#39;s chamber, and here Camaralzaman said to the eunuch:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Now you shall choose. Shall I cure the princess in her own&#10;presence, or shall I do it from here without seeing her?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The eunuch, who had expressed many contemptuous doubts as they&#10;came along of the newcomer&#39;s powers, was much surprised and&#10;said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;If you really can cure, it is immaterial when you do it. Your&#10;fame will be equally great.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Very well,&#34; replied the prince: &#34;then, impatient though I am to&#10;see the princess, I will effect the cure where I stand, the better&#10;to convince you of my power.&#34; He accordingly drew out his writing&#10;case and wrote as follows&#8212;&#34;Adorable princess! The enamoured&#10;Camaralzaman has never forgotten the moment when, contemplating&#10;your sleeping beauty, he gave you his heart. As he was at that time&#10;deprived of the happiness of conversing with you, he ventured to&#10;give you his ring as a token of his love, and to take yours in&#10;exchange, which he now encloses in this letter. Should you deign to&#10;return it to him he will be the happiest of mortals, if not he will&#10;cheerfully resign himself to death, seeing he does so for love of&#10;you. He awaits your reply in your ante-room.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Having finished this note the prince carefully enclosed the ring&#10;in it without letting the eunuch see it, and gave him the letter,&#10;saying:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Take this to your mistress, my friend, and if on reading it and&#10;seeing its contents she is not instantly cured, you may call me an&#10;impudent impostor.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The eunuch at once passed into the princess&#39;s room, and handing&#10;her the letter said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Madam, a new astrologer has arrived, who declares that you will&#10;be cured as soon as you have read this letter and seen what it&#10;contains.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The princess took the note and opened it with languid&#10;indifference. But no sooner did she see her ring than, barely&#10;glancing at the writing, she rose hastily and with one bound&#10;reached the doorway and pushed back the hangings. Here she and the&#10;prince recognised each other, and in a moment they were locked in&#10;each other&#39;s arms, where they tenderly embraced, wondering how they&#10;came to meet at last after so long a separation. The nurse, who had&#10;hastened after her charge, drew them back to the inner room, where&#10;the princess restored her ring to Camaralzaman.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Take it back,&#34; she said, &#34;I could not keep it without returning&#10;yours to you, and I am resolved to wear that as long as I&#10;live.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Meantime the eunuch had hastened back to the king. &#34;Sire,&#34; he&#10;cried, &#34;all the former doctors and astrologers were mere quacks.&#10;This man has cured the princess without even seeing her.&#34; He then&#10;told all to the king, who, overjoyed, hastened to his daughter&#39;s&#10;apartments, where, after embracing her, he placed her hand in that&#10;of the prince, saying:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Happy stranger, I keep my promise, and give you my daughter to&#10;wife, be you who you may. But, if I am not much mistaken, your&#10;condition is above what you appear to be.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The prince thanked the king in the warmest and most respectful&#10;terms, and added: &#34;As regards my person, your Majesty has rightly&#10;guessed that I am not an astrologer. It is but a disguise which I&#10;assumed in order to merit your illustrious alliance. I am myself a&#10;prince, my name is Camaralzaman, and my father is Schahzaman, King&#10;of the Isles of the Children of Khaledan.&#34; He then told his whole&#10;history, including the extraordinary manner of his first seeing and&#10;loving the Princess Badoura.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When he had finished the king exclaimed: &#34;So remarkable a story&#10;must not be lost to posterity. It shall be inscribed in the&#10;archives of my kingdom and published everywhere abroad.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The wedding took place next day amidst great pomp and&#10;rejoicings. Marzavan was not forgotten, but was given a lucrative&#10;post at court, with a promise of further advancement.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The prince and princess were now entirely happy, and months&#10;slipped by unconsciously in the enjoyment of each other&#39;s&#10;society.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;One night, however, Prince Camaralzaman dreamt that he saw his&#10;father lying at the point of death, and saying: &#34;Alas! my son whom&#10;I loved so tenderly, has deserted me and is now causing my&#10;death.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The prince woke with such a groan as to startle the princess,&#10;who asked what was the matter.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ah!&#34; cried the prince, &#34;at this very moment my father is&#10;perhaps no more!&#34; and he told his dream.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The princess said but little at the time, but next morning she&#10;went to the king, and kissing his hand said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I have a favour to ask of your Majesty, and I beg you to&#10;believe that it is in no way prompted by my husband. It is that you&#10;will allow us both to visit my father-in-law King Schahzaman.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Sorry though the king felt at the idea of parting with his&#10;daughter, he felt her request to be so reasonable that he could not&#10;refuse it, and made but one condition, which was that she should&#10;only spend one year at the court of King Schahzaman, suggesting&#10;that in future the young couple should visit their respective&#10;parents alternately.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The princess brought this good news to her husband, who thanked&#10;her tenderly for this fresh proof of her affection.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;All preparations for the journey were now pressed forwards, and&#10;when all was ready the king accompanied the travellers for some&#10;days, after which he took an affectionate leave of his daughter,&#10;and charging the prince to take every care of her, returned to his&#10;capital.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The prince and princess journeyed on, and at the end of a month&#10;reached a huge meadow interspersed with clumps of big trees which&#10;cast a most pleasant shade. As the heat was great, Camaralzaman&#10;thought it well to encamp in this cool spot. Accordingly the tents&#10;were pitched, and the princess entering hers whilst the prince was&#10;giving his further orders, removed her girdle, which she placed&#10;beside her, and desiring her women to leave her, lay down and was&#10;soon asleep.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When the camp was all in order the prince entered the tent and,&#10;seeing the princess asleep, he sat down near her without speaking.&#10;His eyes fell on the girdle which, he took up, and whilst&#10;inspecting the precious stones set in it he noticed a little pouch&#10;sewn to the girdle and fastened by a loop. He touched it and felt&#10;something hard within. Curious as to what this might be, he opened&#10;the pouch and found a cornelian engraved with various figures and&#10;strange characters.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;This cornelian must be something very precious,&#34; thought he,&#10;&#34;or my wife would not wear it on her person with so much care.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In truth it was a talisman which the Queen of China had given&#10;her daughter, telling her it would ensure her happiness as long as&#10;she carried it about her.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The better to examine the stone the prince stepped to the open&#10;doorway of the tent. As he stood there holding it in the open palm&#10;of his hand, a bird suddenly swooped down, picked the stone up in&#10;its beak and flew away with it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Imagine the prince&#39;s dismay at losing a thing by which his wife&#10;evidently set such store!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The bird having secured its prey flew off some yards and&#10;alighted on the ground, holding the talisman it its beak. Prince&#10;Camaralzaman advanced, hoping the bird would drop it, but as soon&#10;as he approached the thief fluttered on a little further still. He&#10;continued his pursuit till the bird suddenly swallowed the stone&#10;and took a longer flight than before. The prince then hoped to kill&#10;it with a stone, but the more hotly he pursued the further flew the&#10;bird.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In this fashion he was led on by hill and dale through the&#10;entire day, and when night came the tiresome creature roosted on&#10;the top of a very high tree where it could rest in safety.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The prince in despair at all his useless trouble began to think&#10;whether he had better return to the camp. &#34;But,&#34; thought he, &#34;how&#10;shall I find my way back? Must I go up hill or down? I should&#10;certainly lose my way in the dark, even if my strength held out.&#34;&#10;Overwhelmed by hunger, thirst, fatigue and sleep, he ended by&#10;spending the night at the foot of the tree.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Next morning Camaralzaman woke up before the bird left its&#10;perch, and no sooner did it take flight than he followed it again&#10;with as little success as the previous day, only stopping to eat&#10;some herbs and fruit he found by the way. In this fashion he spent&#10;ten days, following the bird all day and spending the night at the&#10;foot of a tree, whilst it roosted on the topmost bough. On the&#10;eleventh day the bird and the prince reached a large town, and as&#10;soon as they were close to its walls the bird took a sudden and&#10;higher flight and was shortly completely out of sight, whilst&#10;Camaralzaman felt in despair at having to give up all hopes of ever&#10;recovering the talisman of the Princess Badoura.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Much cast down, he entered the town, which was built near the&#10;sea and had a fine harbour. He walked about the streets for a long&#10;time, not knowing where to go, but at length as he walked near the&#10;seashore he found a garden door open and walked in.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The gardener, a good old man, who was at work, happened to look&#10;up, and, seeing a stranger, whom he recognised by his dress as a&#10;Mussulman, he told him to come in at once and to shut the door.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Camaralzaman did as he was bid, and inquired why this precaution&#10;was taken.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Because,&#34; said the gardener, &#34;I see that you are a stranger and&#10;a Mussulman, and this town is almost entirely inhabited by&#10;idolaters, who hate and persecute all of our faith. It seems almost&#10;a miracle that has led you to this house, and I am indeed glad that&#10;you have found a place of safety.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Camaralzaman warmly thanked the kind old man for offering him&#10;shelter, and was about to say more, but the gardener interrupted&#10;him with:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Leave compliments alone. You are weary and must be hungry. Come&#10;in, eat, and rest.&#34; So saying he led the prince into his cottage,&#10;and after satisfying his hunger begged to learn the cause of his&#10;arrival.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Camaralzaman told him all without disguise, and ended by&#10;inquiring the shortest way to his father&#39;s capital. &#34;For,&#34; added&#10;he, &#34;if I tried to rejoin the princess, how should I find her after&#10;eleven days&#39; separation. Perhaps, indeed, she may be no longer&#10;alive!&#34; At this terrible thought he burst into tears.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The gardener informed Camaralzaman that they were quite a year&#39;s&#10;land journey to any Mahomedan country, but that there was a much&#10;shorter route by sea to the Ebony Island, from whence the Isles of&#10;the Children of Khaledan could be easily reached, and that a ship&#10;sailed once a year for the Ebony Island by which he might get so&#10;far as his very home.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;If only you had arrived a few days sooner,&#34; he said, &#34;you might&#10;have embarked at once. As it is you must now wait till next year,&#10;but if you care to stay with me I offer you my house, such as it&#10;is, with all my heart.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Prince Camaralzaman thought himself lucky to find some place of&#10;refuge, and gladly accepted the gardener&#39;s offer. He spent his days&#10;working in the garden, and his nights thinking of and sighing for&#10;his beloved wife.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Let us now see what had become during this time of the Princess&#10;Badoura.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;On first waking she was much surprised not to find the prince&#10;near her. She called her women and asked if they knew where he was,&#10;and whilst they were telling her that they had seen him enter the&#10;tent, but had not noticed his leaving it, she took up her belt and&#10;perceived that the little pouch was open and the talisman gone.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She at once concluded that her husband had taken it and would&#10;shortly bring it back. She waited for him till evening rather&#10;impatiently, and wondering what could have kept him from her so&#10;long. When night came without him she felt in despair and abused&#10;the talisman and its maker roundly. In spite of her grief and&#10;anxiety however, she did not lose her presence of mind, but decided&#10;on a courageous, though very unusual step.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Only the princess and her women knew of Camaralzaman&#39;s&#10;disappearance, for the rest of the party were sleeping or resting&#10;in their tents. Fearing some treason should the truth be known, she&#10;ordered her women not to say a word which would give rise to any&#10;suspicion, and proceeded to change her dress for one of her&#10;husband&#39;s, to whom, as has been already said, she bore a strong&#10;likeness.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In this disguise she looked so like the prince that when she&#10;gave orders next morning to break up the camp and continue the&#10;journey no one suspected the change. She made one of her women&#10;enter her litter, whilst she herself mounted on horseback and the&#10;march began.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;After a protracted journey by land and sea the princess, still&#10;under the name and disguise of Prince Camaralzaman, arrived at the&#10;capital of the Ebony Island whose king was named Armanos.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;No sooner did the king hear that the ship which was just in port&#10;had on board the son of his old friend and ally than he hurried to&#10;meet the supposed prince, and had him and his retinue brought to&#10;the palace, where they were lodged and entertained sumptuously.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;After three days, finding that his guest, to whom he had taken a&#10;great fancy, talked of continuing his journey, King Armanos said to&#10;him:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Prince, I am now an old man, and unfortunately 1 have no son to&#10;whom to leave my kingdom. It has pleased Heaven to give me only one&#10;daughter, who possesses such great beauty and charm that I could&#10;only give her to a prince as highly born and as accomplished as&#10;yourself. Instead, therefore, of returning to your own country,&#10;take my daughter and my crown and stay with us. I shall feel that I&#10;have a worthy successor, and shall cheerfully retire from the&#10;fatigues of government.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The king&#39;s offer was naturally rather embarrassing to the&#10;Princess Badoura. She felt that it was equally impossible to&#10;confess that she had deceived him, or to refuse the marriage on&#10;which he had set his heart; a refusal which might turn all his&#10;kindness to hatred and persecution.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;All things considered, she decided to accept, and after a few&#10;moments silence said with a blush, which the king attributed to&#10;modesty:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Sire, I feel so great an obligation for the good opinion your&#10;Majesty has expressed for my person and of the honour you do me,&#10;that, though I am quite unworthy of it, I dare not refuse. But,&#10;sire, I can only accept such an alliance if you give me your&#10;promise to assist me with your counsels.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The marriage being thus arranged, the ceremony was fixed for the&#10;following day, and the princess employed the intervening time in&#10;informing the officers of her suite of what had happened, assuring&#10;them that the Princess Badoura had given her full consent to the&#10;marriage. She also told her women, and bade them keep her secret&#10;well.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;King Armanos, delighted with the success of his plans, lost no&#10;time in assembling his court and council, to whom he presented his&#10;successor, and placing his future son-in-law on the throne made&#10;everyone do homage and take oaths of allegiance to the new&#10;king.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At night the whole town was filled with rejoicings, and with&#10;much pomp the Princess Haiatelnefous (this was the name of the&#10;king&#39;s daughter) was conducted to the palace of the Princess&#10;Badoura.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now Badoura had thought much of the difficulties of her first&#10;interview with King Armanos&#39; daughter, and she felt the only thing&#10;to do was at once to take her into her confidence.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Accordingly, as soon as they were alone she took Haiatelnefous&#10;by the hand and said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Princess, I have a secret to tell you, and must throw myself on&#10;your mercy. I am not Prince Camaralzaman, but a princess like&#10;yourself and his wife, and I beg you to listen to my story, then I&#10;am sure you will forgive my imposture, in consideration of my&#10;sufferings.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She then related her whole history, and at its close&#10;Haiatelnefous embraced her warmly, and assured her of her entire&#10;sympathy and affection.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The two princesses now planned out their future action, and&#10;agreed to combine to keep up the deception and to let Badoura&#10;continue to play a man&#39;s part until such time as there might be&#10;news of the real Camaralzaman.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Whilst these things were passing in the Ebony Island Prince&#10;Camaralzaman continued to find shelter in the gardeners cottage in&#10;the town of the idolaters.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Early one morning the gardener said to the prince:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;To-day is a public holiday, and the people of the town not only&#10;do not work themselves but forbid others to do so. You had better&#10;therefore take a good rest whilst I go to see some friends, and as&#10;the time is near for the arrival of the ship of which I told you I&#10;will make inquiries about it, and try to bespeak a passage for&#10;you.&#34; He then put on his best clothes and went out, leaving the&#10;prince, who strolled into the garden and was soon lost in thoughts&#10;of his dear wife and their sad separation.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As he walked up and down he was suddenly disturbed in his&#10;reverie by the noise two large birds were making in a tree.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Camaralzaman stood still and looked up, and saw that the birds&#10;were fighting so savagely with beaks and claws that before long one&#10;fell dead to the ground, whilst the conqueror spread his wings and&#10;flew away. Almost immediately two other larger birds, who had been&#10;watching the duel, flew up and alighted, one at the head and the&#10;other at the feet of the dead bird. They stood there some time&#10;sadly shaking their heads, and then dug up a grave with their claws&#10;in which they buried him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As soon as they had filled in the grave the two flew off, and&#10;ere long returned, bringing with them the murderer, whom they held,&#10;one by a wing and the other by a leg, with their beaks, screaming&#10;and struggling with rage and terror. But they held tight, and&#10;having brought him to his victim&#39;s grave, they proceeded to kill&#10;him, after which they tore open his body, scattered the inside and&#10;once more flew away.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The prince, who had watched the whole scene with much interest,&#10;now drew near the spot where it happened, and glancing at the dead&#10;bird he noticed something red lying near which had evidently fallen&#10;out of its inside. He picked it up, and what was his surprise when&#10;he recognised the Princess Badoura&#39;s talisman which had been the&#10;cause of many misfortunes. It would be impossible to describe his&#10;joy; he kissed the talisman repeatedly, wrapped it up, and&#10;carefully tied it round his arm. For the first time since his&#10;separation from the princess he had a good night, and next morning&#10;he was up at day-break and went cheerfully to ask what work he&#10;should do.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The gardener told him to cut down an old fruit tree which had&#10;quite died away, and Camaralzaman took an axe and fell to&#10;vigorously. As he was hacking at one of the roots the axe struck on&#10;something hard. On pushing away the earth he discovered a large&#10;slab of bronze, under which was disclosed a staircase with ten&#10;steps. He went down them and found himself in a roomy kind of cave&#10;in which stood fifty large bronze jars, each with a cover on it.&#10;The prince uncovered one after another, and found them all filled&#10;with gold dust. Delighted with his discovery he left the cave,&#10;replaced the slab, and having finished cutting down the tree waited&#10;for the gardener&#39;s return.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The gardener had heard the night before that the ship about&#10;which he was inquiring would start ere long, but the exact date not&#10;being yet known he had been told to return next day for further&#10;information. He had gone therefore to inquire, and came back with&#10;good news beaming in his face.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My son,&#34; said he, &#34;rejoice and hold yourself ready to start in&#10;three days&#39; time. The ship is to set sail, and I have arranged all&#10;about your passage with the captain&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You could not bring me better news,&#34; replied Camaralzaman, &#34;and&#10;in return I have something pleasant to tell you. Follow me and see&#10;the good fortune which has befallen you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He then led the gardener to the cave, and having shown him the&#10;treasure stored up there, said how happy it made him that Heaven&#10;should in this way reward his kind host&#39;s many virtues and&#10;compensate him for the privations of many years.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What do you mean?&#34; asked the gardener. &#34;Do you imagine that I&#10;should appropriate this treasure? It is yours, and I have no right&#10;whatever to it. For the last eighty years I have dug up the ground&#10;here without discovering anything. It is clear that these riches&#10;are intended for you, and they are much more needed by a prince&#10;like yourself than by an old man like me, who am near my end and&#10;require nothing. This treasure comes just at the right time, when&#10;you are about to return to your own country, where you will make&#10;good use of it.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But the prince would not hear of this suggestion, and finally&#10;after much discussion they agreed to divide the gold. When this was&#10;done the gardener said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My son, the great thing now is to arrange how you can best&#10;carry off this treasure as secretly as possible for fear of losing&#10;it. There are no olives in the Ebony Island, and those imported&#10;from here fetch a high price. As you know, I have a good stock of&#10;the olives which grew in this garden. Now you must take fifty jars,&#10;fill each half full of gold dust and fill them up with the olives.&#10;We will then have them taken on board ship when you embark.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The prince took this advice, and spent the rest of the day&#10;filling the fifty jars, and fearing lest the precious talisman&#10;might slip from his arm and be lost again, he took the precaution&#10;of putting it in one of the jars, on which he made a mark so as to&#10;be able to recognise it. When night came the jars were all ready,&#10;and the prince and his host went to bed.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Whether in consequence of his great age, or of the fatigues and&#10;excitement of the previous day, I do not know, but the gardener&#10;passed a very bad night. He was worse next day, and by the morning&#10;of the third day was dangerously ill. At daybreak the ship&#39;s&#10;captain and some of his sailors knocked at the garden door and&#10;asked for the passenger who was to embark.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I am he,&#34; said Camaralzaman, who had opened the door. &#34;The&#10;gardener who took my passage is ill and cannot see you, but please&#10;come in and take these jars of olives and my bag, and I will follow&#10;as soon as I have taken leave of him.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The sailors did as he asked, and the captain before leaving&#10;charged Camaralzaman to lose no time, as the wind was fair, and he&#10;wished to set sail at once.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As soon as they were gone the prince returned to the cottage to&#10;bid farewell to his old friend, and to thank him once more for all&#10;his kindness. But the old man was at his last gasp, and had barely&#10;murmured his confession of faith when he expired.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Camaralzaman was obliged to stay and pay him the last offices,&#10;so having dug a grave in the garden he wrapped the kind old man up&#10;and buried him. He then locked the door, gave up the key to the&#10;owner of the garden, and hurried to the quay only to hear that the&#10;ship had sailed long ago, after waiting three hours for him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It may well be believed that the prince felt in despair at this&#10;fresh misfortune, which obliged him to spend another year in a&#10;strange and distasteful country. Moreover, he had once more lost&#10;the Princess Badoura&#39;s talisman, which he feared he might never see&#10;again. There was nothing left for him but to hire the garden as the&#10;old man had done, and to live on in the cottage. As he could not&#10;well cultivate the garden by himself, he engaged a lad to help him,&#10;and to secure the rest of the treasure he put the remaining gold&#10;dust into fifty more jars, filling them up with olives so as to&#10;have them ready for transport.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Whilst the prince was settling down to this second year of toil&#10;and privation, the ship made a rapid voyage and arrived safely at&#10;the Ebony Island.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As the palace of the new king, or rather of the Princess&#10;Badoura, overlooked the harbour, she saw the ship entering it and&#10;asked what vessel it was coming in so gaily decked with flags, and&#10;was told that it was a ship from the Island of the Idolaters which&#10;yearly brought rich merchandise.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The princess, ever on the look out for any chance of news of her&#10;beloved husband, went down to the harbour attended by some officers&#10;of the court, and arrived just as the captain was landing. She sent&#10;for him and asked many questions as to his country, voyage, what&#10;passengers he had, and what his vessel was laden with. The captain&#10;answered all her questions, and said that his passengers consisted&#10;entirely of traders who brought rich stuffs from various countries,&#10;fine muslins, precious stones, musk, amber, spices, drugs, olives,&#10;and many other things.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As soon as he mentioned olives, the princess, who was very&#10;partial to them, exclaimed:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I will take all you have on board. Have them unloaded and we&#10;will make our bargain at once, and tell the other merchants to let&#10;me see all their best wares before showing them to other&#10;people.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Sire,&#34; replied the captain, &#34;I have on board fifty very large&#10;pots of olives. They belong to a merchant who was left behind, as&#10;in spite of waiting for him he delayed so long that I was obliged&#10;to set sail without him.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Never mind,&#34; said the princess, &#34;unload them all the same, and&#10;we will arrange the price.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The captain accordingly sent his boat off to the ship and it&#10;soon returned laden with the fifty pots of olives. The princess&#10;asked what they might be worth.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Sire,&#34; replied the captain, &#34;the merchant is very poor. Your&#10;Majesty will not overpay him if you give him a thousand pieces of&#10;silver.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;In order to satisfy him and as he is so poor,&#34; said the&#10;princess, &#34;I will order a thousand pieces of gold to be given you,&#10;which you will be sure to remit to him.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So saying she gave orders for the payment and returned to the&#10;palace, having the jars carried before her. When evening came the&#10;Princess Badoura retired to the inner part of the palace, and going&#10;to the apartments of the Princess Haiatelnefous she had the fifty&#10;jars of olives brought to her. She opened one to let her friend&#10;taste the olives and to taste them herself, but great was her&#10;surprise when, on pouring some into a dish, she found them all&#10;powdered with gold dust. &#34;What an adventure! how extraordinary!&#34;&#10;she cried. Then she had the other jars opened, and was more and&#10;more surprised to find the olives in each jar mixed with gold&#10;dust.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But when at length her talisman was discovered in one of the&#10;jars her emotion was so great that she fainted away. The Princess&#10;Haiatelnefous and her women hastened to restore her, and as soon as&#10;she recovered consciousness she covered the precious talisman with&#10;kisses.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then, dismissing the attendants, she said to her friend:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You will have guessed, my dear, that it was the sight of this&#10;talisman which has moved me so deeply. This was the cause of my&#10;separation from my dear husband, and now, I am convinced, it will&#10;be the means of our reunion.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As soon as it was light next day the Princess Badoura sent for&#10;the captain, and made further inquiries about the merchant who&#10;owned the olive jars she had bought.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In reply the captain told her all he knew of the place where the&#10;young man lived, and how, after engaging his passage, he came to be&#10;left behind.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;If that is the case,&#34; said the princess, &#34;you must set sail at&#10;once and go back for him. He is a debtor of mine and must be&#10;brought here at once, or I will confiscate all your merchandise. I&#10;shall now give orders to have all the warehouses where your cargo&#10;is placed under the royal seal, and they will only be opened when&#10;you have brought me the man I ask for. Go at once and obey my&#10;orders.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The captain had no choice but to do as he was bid, so hastily&#10;provisioning his ship he started that same evening on his return&#10;voyage.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When, after a rapid passage, he gained sight of the Island of&#10;Idolaters, he judged it better not to enter the harbour, but&#10;casting anchor at some distance he embarked at night in a small&#10;boat with six active sailors and landed near Camaralzaman&#39;s&#10;cottage.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The prince was not asleep, and as he lay awake moaning over all&#10;the sad events which had separated him from his wife, he thought he&#10;heard a knock at the garden door. He went to open it, and was&#10;immediately seized by the captain and sailors, who without a word&#10;of explanation forcibly bore him off to the boat, which took them&#10;back to the ship without loss of time. No sooner were they on board&#10;than they weighed anchor and set sail.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Camaralzaman, who had kept silence till then, now asked the&#10;captain (whom he had recognised) the reason for this abduction.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Are you not a debtor of the King of the Ebony Island?&#34; asked&#10;the captain.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I? Why, I never even heard of him before, and never set foot in&#10;his kingdom!&#34; was the answer.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well, you must know better than I,&#34; said the captain. &#34;You will&#10;soon see him now, and meantime be content where you are and have&#10;patience.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The return voyage was as prosperous as the former one, and&#10;though it was night when the ship entered the harbour, the captain&#10;lost no time in landing with his passenger, whom he conducted to&#10;the palace, where he begged an audience with the king.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Directly the Princess Badoura saw the prince she recognised him&#10;in spite of his shabby clothes. She longed to throw herself on his&#10;neck, but restrained herself, feeling it was better for them both&#10;that she should play her part a little longer. She therefore&#10;desired one of her officers to take care of him and to treat him&#10;well. Next she ordered another officer to remove the seals from the&#10;warehouse, whilst she presented the captain with a costly diamond,&#10;and told him to keep the thousand pieces of gold paid for the&#10;olives, as she would arrange matters with the merchant himself.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She then returned to her private apartments, where she told the&#10;Princess Haiatelnefous all that had happened, as well as her plans&#10;for the future, and begged her assistance, which her friend readily&#10;promised.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Next morning she ordered the prince to be taken to the bath and&#10;clothed in a manner suitable to an emir or governor of a province.&#10;He was then introduced to the council, where his good looks and&#10;grand air drew the attention of all on him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Princess Badoura, delighted to see him looking himself once&#10;more, turned to the other emirs, saying:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My lords, I introduce to you a new colleague, Camaralzaman,&#10;whom I have known on my travels and who, I can assure you, you will&#10;find well deserves your regard and admiration.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Camaralzaman was much surprised at hearing the king&#8212;whom he&#10;never suspected of being a woman in disguise&#8212;asserting their&#10;acquaintance, for he felt sure he had never seen her before.&#10;However he received all the praises bestowed on him with becoming&#10;modesty, and prostrating himself, said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Sire, I cannot find words in which to thank your Majesty for&#10;the great honour conferred on me. I can but assure you that I will&#10;do all in my power to prove myself worthy of it.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;On leaving the council the prince was conducted to a splendid&#10;house which had been prepared for him, where he found a full&#10;establishment and well-filled stables at his orders. On entering&#10;his study his steward presented him with a coffer filled with gold&#10;pieces for his current expenses. He felt more and more puzzled by&#10;such good fortune, and little guessed that the Princess of China&#10;was the cause of it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;After a few days the Princess Badoura promoted Camaralzaman to&#10;the post of grand treasurer, an office which he filled with so much&#10;integrity and benevolence as to win universal esteem.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He would now have thought himself the happiest of men had it not&#10;been for that separation which he never ceased to bewail. He had no&#10;clue to the mystery of his present position, for the princess, out&#10;of compliment to the old king, had taken his name, and was&#10;generally known as King Armanos the younger, few people remembering&#10;that on her first arrival she went by another name.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At length the princess felt that the time had come to put an end&#10;to her own and the prince&#39;s suspense, and having arranged all her&#10;plans with the Princess Haiatelnefous, she informed Camaralzaman&#10;that she wished his advice on some important business, and, to&#10;avoid being disturbed, desired him to come to the palace that&#10;evening.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The prince was punctual, and was received in the private&#10;apartment, when, having ordered her attendants to withdraw, the&#10;princess took from a small box the talisman, and, handing it to&#10;Camaralzaman, said: &#34;Not long ago an astrologer gave me this&#10;talisman. As you are universally well informed, you can perhaps&#10;tell me what is its use.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Camaralzaman took the talisman and, holding it to the light,&#10;cried with surprise, &#34;Sire, you ask me the use of this talisman.&#10;Alas! hitherto it has been only a source of misfortune to me, being&#10;the cause of my separation from the one I love best on earth. The&#10;story is so sad and strange that I am sure your Majesty will be&#10;touched by it if you will permit me to tell it you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I will hear it some other time,&#34; replied the princess.&#10;&#34;Meanwhile I fancy it is not quite unknown to me. Wait here for me.&#10;I will return shortly.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So saying she retired to another room, where she hastily changed&#10;her masculine attire for that of a woman, and, after putting on the&#10;girdle she wore the day they parted, returned to Camaralzaman.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The prince recognised her at once, and, embracing her with the&#10;utmost tenderness, cried, &#34;Ah, how can I thank the king for this&#10;delightful surprise?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Do not expect ever to see the king again,&#34; said the princess,&#10;as she wiped the tears of joy from her eyes, &#34;in me you see the&#10;king. Let us sit down, and I will tell you all about it.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She then gave a full account of all her adventures since their&#10;parting, and dwelt much on the charms and noble disposition of the&#10;Princess Haiatelnefous, to whose friendly assistance she owed so&#10;much. When she had done she asked to hear the prince&#39;s story, and&#10;in this manner they spent most of the night.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Next morning the princess resumed her woman&#39;s clothes, and as&#10;soon as she was ready she desired the chief eunuch to beg King&#10;Armanos to come to her apartments.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When the king arrived great was his surprise at finding a&#10;strange lady in company of the grand treasurer who had no actual&#10;right to enter the private apartment. Seating himself he asked for&#10;the king.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Sire,&#34; said the princess, &#34;yesterday I was the king, to-day I&#10;am only the Princess of China and wife to the real Prince&#10;Camaralzaman, son of King Schahzaman, and I trust that when your&#10;Majesty shall have heard our story you will not condemn the&#10;innocent deception I have been obliged to practise.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The king consented to listen, and did so with marked&#10;surprise.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At the close of her narrative the princess said, &#34;Sire, as our&#10;religion allows a man to have more than one wife, I would beg your&#10;Majesty to give your daughter, the Princess Haiatelnefous, in&#10;marriage to Prince Camaralzaman. I gladly yield to her the&#10;precedence and title of Queen in recognition of the debt of&#10;gratitude which I owe her.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;King Armanos heard the princess with surprise and admiration,&#10;then, turning to Camaralzaman, he said, &#34;My son, as your wife, the&#10;Princess Badoura (whom I have hitherto looked on as my son-in-law),&#10;consents to share your hand and affections with my daughter, I have&#10;only to ask if this marriage is agreeable to you, and if you will&#10;consent to accept the crown which the Princess Badoura deserves to&#10;wear all her life, but which she prefers to resign for love of&#10;you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Sire,&#34; replied Camaralzaman, &#34;I can refuse your Majesty&#10;nothing.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Accordingly Camaralzaman was duly proclaimed king, and as duly&#10;married with all pomp to the Princess Haiatelnefous, with whose&#10;beauty, talents, and affections he had every reason to be&#10;pleased.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The two queens lived in true sisterly harmony together, and&#10;after a time each presented King Camaralzaman with a son, whose&#10;births were celebrated throughout the kingdom with the utmost&#10;rejoicing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 3, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/208', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('Noureddin and the Fair Persian'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;Balsora was the capital of a kingdom long tributary to the&#10;caliph. During the time of the Caliph Haroun-al-Raschid the king of&#10;Balsora, who was his cousin, was called Zinebi. Not thinking one&#10;vizir enough for the administration of his estates he had two,&#10;named Khacan and Saouy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Khacan was kind, generous, and liberal, and took pleasure in&#10;obliging, as far as in him lay, those who had business with him.&#10;Throughout the entire kingdom there was no one who did not esteem&#10;and praise him as he deserved.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Saouy was quite a different character, and repelled everyone&#10;with whom he came in contact; he was always gloomy, and, in spite&#10;of his great riches, so miserly that he denied himself even the&#10;necessaries of life. What made him particularly detested was the&#10;great aversion he had to Khacan, of whom he never ceased to speak&#10;evil to the king.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;One day, while the king amused himself talking with his two&#10;vizirs and other members of the council, the conversation turned on&#10;female slaves. While some declared that it sufficed for a slave to&#10;be beautiful, others, and Khacan was among the number, maintained&#10;that beauty alone was not enough, but that it must be accompanied&#10;by wit, wisdom, modesty, and, if possible, knowledge.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The king not only declared himself to be of this opinion, but&#10;charged Khacan to procure him a slave who should fulfil all these&#10;conditions. Saouy, who had been of the opposite side, and was&#10;jealous of the honour done to Khacan, said, &#34;Sire, it will be very&#10;difficult to find a slave as accomplished as your Majesty desires,&#10;and, if she is to be found, she will be cheap if she cost less than&#10;10,000 gold pieces.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Saouy,&#34; answered the king, &#34;you seem to find that a very great&#10;sum. For you it may be so, but not for me.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And forthwith he ordered his grand treasurer, who was present,&#10;to send 10,000 gold pieces to Khacan for the purchase of the&#10;slave.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As soon, then, as Khacan returned home he sent for the dealers&#10;in female slaves, and charged them directly they had found such a&#10;one as he described to inform him. They promised to do their&#10;utmost, and no day passed that they did not bring a slave for his&#10;inspection but none was found without some defect.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At length, early one morning, while Khacan was on his way to the&#10;king&#39;s palace, a dealer, throwing himself in his way, announced&#10;eagerly that a Persian merchant, arrived late the previous evening,&#10;had a slave to sell whose wit and wisdom were equal to her&#10;incomparable beauty.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Khacan, overjoyed at this news, gave orders that the slave&#10;should be brought for his inspection on his return from the palace.&#10;The dealer appearing at the appointed hour, Khacan found the slave&#10;beautiful beyond his expectations, and immediately gave her the&#10;name of &#34;The Fair Persian.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Being a man of great wisdom and learning, he perceived in the&#10;short conversation he had with her that he would seek in vain&#10;another slave to surpass her in any of the qualities required by&#10;the king, and therefore asked the dealer what price the merchant&#10;put upon her.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Sir,&#34; was the answer, &#34;for less than 10,000 gold pieces he will&#10;not let her go; he declares that, what with masters for her&#10;instruction, and for bodily exercises, not to speak of clothing and&#10;nourishment, he has already spent that sum upon her. She is in&#10;every way fit to be the slave of a king; she plays every musical&#10;instrument, she sings, she dances, she makes verses, in fact there&#10;is no accomplishment in which she does not excel.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Khacan, who was better able to judge of her merits than the&#10;dealer, wishing to bring the matter to a conclusion, sent for the&#10;merchant, and said to him, &#34;It is not for myself that I wish to buy&#10;your slave, but for the king. Her price, however, is too high.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Sir,&#34; replied the merchant, &#34;I should esteem it an honour to&#10;present her to his Majesty, did it become a merchant to do such a&#10;thing. I ask no more than the sum it has cost me to make her such&#10;as she is.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Khacan, not wishing to bargain, immediately had the sum counted&#10;out, and given to the merchant, who before withdrawing said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Sir, as she is destined for the king, I would have you observe&#10;that she is extremely tired with the long journey, and before&#10;presenting her to his Majesty you would do well to keep her a&#10;fortnight in your own house, and to see that a little care is&#10;bestowed upon her. The sun has tanned her complexion, but when she&#10;has been two or three times to the bath, and is fittingly dressed,&#10;you will see how much her beauty will be increased.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Khacan thanked the merchant for his advice, and determined to&#10;follow it. He gave the beautiful Persian an apartment near to that&#10;of his wife, whom he charged to treat her as befitting a lady&#10;destined for the king, and to order for her the most magnificent&#10;garments.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Before bidding adieu to the fair Persian, he said to her: &#34;No&#10;happiness can be greater than what I have procured for you; judge&#10;for yourself, you now belong to the king. I have, however, to warn&#10;you of one thing. I have a son, who, though not wanting in sense,&#10;is young, foolish, and headstrong, and I charge you to keep him at&#10;a distance.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Persian thanked him for his advice, and promised to profit&#10;by it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Noureddin&#8212;for so the vizir&#39;s son was named&#8212;went freely in and&#10;out of his mother&#39;s apartments. He was young, well-made and&#10;agreeable, and had the gift of charming all with whom he came in&#10;contact. As soon as he saw the beautiful Persian, though aware that&#10;she was destined for the king, he let himself be carried away by&#10;her charms, and determined at once to use every means in his power&#10;to retain her for himself. The Persian was equally captivated by&#10;Noureddin, and said to herself: &#34;The vizir does me too great honour&#10;in buying me for the king. I should esteem myself very happy if he&#10;would give me to his son.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Noureddin availed himself of every opportunity to gaze upon her&#10;beauty, to talk and laugh with her, and never would have left her&#10;side if his mother had not forced him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Some time having elapsed, on account of the long journey, since&#10;the beautiful Persian had been to the bath, five or six days after&#10;her purchase the vizir&#39;s wife gave orders that the bath should be&#10;heated for her, and that her own female slaves should attend her&#10;there, and after-wards should array her in a magnificent dress that&#10;had been prepared for her.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Her toilet completed, the beautiful Persian came to present&#10;herself to the vizir&#39;s wife, who hardly recognised her, so greatly&#10;was her beauty increased. Kissing her hand, the beautiful slave&#10;said: &#34;Madam, I do not know how you find me in this dress that you&#10;have had prepared for me; your women assure me that it suits me so&#10;well that they hardly knew me. If it is the truth they tell me, and&#10;not flattery, it is to you I owe the transformation.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My daughter,&#34; answered the vizir&#39;s wife, &#34;they do not flatter&#10;you. I myself hardly recognised you. The improvement is not due to&#10;the dress alone, but largely to the beautifying effects of the&#10;bath. I am so struck by its results, that I would try it on&#10;myself.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Acting forthwith on this decision she ordered two little slaves&#10;during her absence to watch over the beautiful Persian, and not to&#10;allow Noureddin to enter should he come.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She had no sooner gone than he arrived, and not finding his&#10;mother in her apartment, would have sought her in that of the&#10;Persian. The two little slaves barred the entrance, saying that his&#10;mother had given orders that he was not to be admitted. Taking each&#10;by an arm, he put them out of the anteroom, and shut the door. Then&#10;they rushed to the bath, informing their mistress with shrieks and&#10;tears that Noureddin had driven them away by force and gone in.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;This news caused great consternation to the lady, who, dressing&#10;herself as quickly as possible, hastened to the apartment of the&#10;fair Persian, to find that Noureddin had already gone out. Much&#10;astonished to see the vizir&#39;s wife enter in tears, the Persian&#10;asked what misfortune had happened.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What!&#34; exclaimed the lady, &#34;you ask me that, knowing that my&#10;son Noureddin has been alone with you?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But, madam,&#34; inquired the Persian, &#34;what harm is there in&#10;that?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;How! Has my husband not told you that you are destined for the&#10;king?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Certainly, but Noureddin has just been to tell me that his&#10;father has changed his mind and has bestowed me upon him. I&#10;believed him, and so great is my affection for Noureddin that I&#10;would willingly pass my life with him.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Would to heaven,&#34; exclaimed the wife of the vizir, &#34;that what&#10;you say were true; but Noureddin has deceived you, and his father&#10;will sacrifice him in vengeance for the wrong he has done.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So saying, she wept bitterly, and all her slaves wept with&#10;her.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Khacan, entering shortly after this, was much astonished to find&#10;his wife and her slaves in tears, and the beautiful Persian greatly&#10;perturbed. He inquired the cause, but for some time no answer was&#10;forthcoming. When his wife was at length sufficiently calm to&#10;inform him of what had happened, his rage and mortification knew no&#10;bounds. Wringing his hands and rending his beard, he exclaimed:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Wretched son! thou destroyest not only thyself but thy father.&#10;The king will shed not only thy blood but mine.&#34; His wife tried to&#10;console him, saying: &#34;Do not torment thyself. With the sale of my&#10;jewels I will obtain 10,000 gold pieces, and with this sum you will&#10;buy another slave.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Do not suppose,&#34; replied her husband, &#34;that it is the loss of&#10;the money that affects me. My honour is at stake, and that is more&#10;precious to me than all my wealth. You know that Saouy is my mortal&#10;enemy. He will relate all this to the king, and you will see the&#10;consequences that will ensue.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My lord,&#34; said his wife, &#34;I am quite aware of Saouy&#39;s baseness,&#10;and that he is capable of playing you this malicious trick. But how&#10;can he or any one else know what takes place in this house? Even if&#10;you are suspected and the king accuses you, you have only to say&#10;that, after examining the slave, you did not find her worthy of his&#10;Majesty. Reassure yourself, and send to the dealers, saying that&#10;you are not satisfied, and wish them to find you another&#10;slave.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;This advice appearing reasonable, Khacan decided to follow it,&#10;but his wrath against his son did not abate. Noureddin dared not&#10;appear all that day, and fearing to take refuge with his usual&#10;associates in case his father should seek him there, he spent the&#10;day in a secluded garden where he was not known. He did not return&#10;home till after his father had gone to bed, and went out early next&#10;morning before the vizir awoke, and these precautions he kept up&#10;during an entire month.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;His mother, though knowing very well that he returned to the&#10;house every evening, dare not ask her husband to pardon him. At&#10;length she took courage and said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My lord, I know that a son could not act more basely towards&#10;his father than Noureddin has done towards you, but after all will&#10;you now pardon him? Do you not consider the harm you may be doing&#10;yourself, and fear that malicious people, seeking the cause of your&#10;estrangement, may guess the real one?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Madam,&#34; replied the vizir, &#34;what you say is very just, but I&#10;cannot pardon Noureddin before I have mortified him as he&#10;deserves.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;He will be sufficiently punished,&#34; answered the lady, &#34;if you&#10;do as I suggest. In the evening, when he returns home, lie in wait&#10;for him and pretend that you will slay him. I will come to his aid,&#10;and while pointing out that you only yield his life at my&#10;supplications, you can force him to take the beautiful Persian on&#10;any conditions you please.&#34; Khacan agreed to follow this plan, and&#10;everything took place as arranged. On Noureddin&#39;s return Khacan&#10;pretended to be about to slay him, but yielding to his wife&#39;s&#10;intercession, said to his son:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You owe your life to your mother. I pardon you on her&#10;intercession, and on the conditions that you take the beautiful&#10;Persian for your wife, and not your slave, that you never sell her,&#10;nor put her away.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Noureddin, not hoping for so great indulgence, thanked his&#10;father, and vowed to do as he desired. Khacan was at great pains&#10;frequently to speak to the king of the difficulties attending the&#10;commission he had given him, but some whispers of what had actually&#10;taken place did reach Saouy&#39;s ears.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;More than a year after these events the minister took a chill,&#10;leaving the bath while still heated to go out on important&#10;business. This resulted in inflammation of the lungs, which rapidly&#10;increased. The vizir, feeling that his end was at hand, sent for&#10;Noureddin, and charged him with his dying breath never to part with&#10;the beautiful Persian.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Shortly afterwards he expired, leaving universal regret&#10;throughout the kingdom; rich and poor alike followed him to the&#10;grave. Noureddin showed every mark of the deepest grief at his&#10;father&#39;s death, and for long refused to see any one. At length a&#10;day came when, one of his friends being admitted, urged him&#10;strongly to be consoled, and to resume his former place in society.&#10;This advice Noureddin was not slow to follow, and soon he formed&#10;little society of ten young men all about his own age, with whom he&#10;spent all his time in continual feasting and merry-making.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Sometimes the fair Persian consented to appear at these&#10;festivities, but she disapproved of this lavish expenditure, and&#10;did not scruple to warn Noureddin of the probable consequences. He,&#10;however, only laughed at her advice, saying, that his father had&#10;always kept him in too great constraint, and that now he rejoiced&#10;at his new-found liberty.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;What added to the confusion in his affairs was that he refused&#10;to look into his accounts with his steward, sending him away every&#10;time he appeared with his book.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;See only that I live well,&#34; he said, &#34;and do not disturb me&#10;about anything else.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Not only did Noureddin&#39;s friends constantly partake of his&#10;hospitality, but in every way they took advantage of his&#10;generosity; everything of his that they admired, whether land,&#10;houses, baths, or any other source of his revenue, he immediately&#10;bestowed on them. In vain the Persian protested against the wrong&#10;he did himself; he continued to scatter with the same lavish&#10;hand.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Throughout one entire year Noureddin did nothing but amuse&#10;himself, and dissipate the wealth his father had taken such pains&#10;to acquire. The year had barely elapsed, when one day, as they sat&#10;at table, there came a knock at the door. The slaves having been&#10;sent away, Noureddin went to open it himself. One of his friends&#10;had risen at the same time, but Noureddin was before him, and&#10;finding the intruder to be the steward, he went out and closed the&#10;door. The friend, curious to hear what passed between them, hid&#10;himself behind the hangings, and heard the following words:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My lord,&#34; said the steward, &#34;I beg a thousand pardons for&#10;interrupting you, but what I have long foreseen has taken place.&#10;Nothing remains of the sums you gave me for your expenses, and all&#10;other sources of income are also at end, having been transferred by&#10;you to others. If you wish me to remain in your service, furnish me&#10;with the necessary funds, else I must withdraw.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So great was Noureddin&#39;s consternation that he had not a word to&#10;say in reply.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The friend, who had been listening behind the curtain,&#10;immediately hastened to communicate the news to the rest of the&#10;company.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;If this is so,&#34; they said, &#34;we must cease to come here.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Noureddin re-entering at that moment, they plainly saw, in spite&#10;of his efforts to dissemble, that what they had heard was the&#10;truth. One by one they rose, and each with a different excuse left&#10;the room, till presently he found himself alone, though little&#10;suspecting the resolution his friends had taken. Then, seeing the&#10;beautiful Persian, he confided to her the statement of the steward,&#10;with many expressions of regret for his own carelessness.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Had I but followed your advice, beautiful Persian,&#34; he said,&#10;&#34;all this would not have happened, but at least I have this&#10;consolation, that I have spent my fortune in the company of friends&#10;who will not desert me in an hour of need. To-morrow I will go to&#10;them, and amongst them they will lend me a sum sufficient to start&#10;in some business.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Accordingly next morning early Noureddin went to seek his ten&#10;friends, who all lived in the same street. Knocking at the door of&#10;the first and chief, the slave who opened it left him to wait in a&#10;hall while he announced his visit to his master. &#34;Noureddin!&#34; he&#10;heard him exclaim quite audibly. &#34;Tell him, every time he calls,&#10;that I am not at home.&#34; The same thing happened at the second door,&#10;and also at the third, and so on with all the ten. Noureddin, much&#10;mortified, recognised too late that he had confided in false&#10;friends, who abandoned him in his hour of need. Overwhelmed with&#10;grief, he sought consolation from the beautiful Persian.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Alas, my lord,&#34; she said, &#34;at last you are convinced of the&#10;truth of what I foretold. There is now no other resource left but&#10;to sell your slaves and your furniture.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;First then he sold the slaves, and subsisted for a time on the&#10;proceeds, after that the furniture was sold, and as much of it was&#10;valuable it sufficed for some time. Finally this resource also came&#10;to an end, and again he sought counsel from the beautiful&#10;Persian.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My lord,&#34; she said, &#34;I know that the late vizir, your father,&#10;bought me for 10,000 gold pieces, and though I have diminished in&#10;value since, I should still fetch a large sum. Do not therefore&#10;hesitate to sell me, and with the money you obtain go and establish&#10;yourself in business in some distant town.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Charming Persian,&#34; answered Noureddin, &#34;how could I be guilty&#10;of such baseness? I would die rather than part from you whom I love&#10;better than my life.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My lord,&#34; she replied, &#34;I am well aware of your love for me,&#10;which is only equalled by mine for you, but a cruel necessity&#10;obliges us to seek the only remedy.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Noureddin, convinced at length of the truth of her words,&#10;yielded, and reluctantly led her to the slave market, where,&#10;showing her to a dealer named Hagi Hassan, he inquired her&#10;value.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Taking them into a room apart, Hagi Hassan exclaimed as soon as&#10;she had unveiled, &#34;My lord, is not this the slave your father&#10;bought for 10,000 pieces?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;On learning that it was so, he promised to obtain the highest&#10;possible price for her. Leaving the beautiful Persian shut up in&#10;the room alone, he went ont to seek the slave merchants, announcing&#10;to them that he had found the pearl among slaves, and asking them&#10;to come and put a value upon her. As soon as they saw her they&#10;agreed that less than 4,000 gold pieces could not be asked. Hagi&#10;Hassan, then closing the door upon her, began to offer her for&#10;sale&#8212;calling out: &#34;Who will bid 4,000 gold pieces for the Persian&#10;slave?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Before any of the merchants had bid, Saouy happened to pass that&#10;way, and judging that it must be a slave of extraordinary beauty,&#10;rode up to Hagi Hassan and desired to see her. Now it was not the&#10;custom to show a slave to a private bidder, but as no one dared to&#10;disobey the vizir his request was granted.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As soon as Saouy saw the Persian he was so struck by her beauty,&#10;that he immediately wished to possess her, and not knowing that she&#10;belonged to Noureddin, he desired Hagi Hassan to send for the owner&#10;and to conclude the bargain at once.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Hagi Hassan then sought Noureddin, and told him that his slave&#10;was going far below her value, and that if Saouy bought her he was&#10;capable of not paying the money. &#34;What you must do,&#34; he said, &#34;is&#10;to pretend that you had no real intention of selling your slave,&#10;and only swore you would in a fit of anger against her. When I&#10;present her to Saouy as if with your consent you must step in, and&#10;with blows begin to lead her away.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Noureddin did as Hagi Hassan advised, to the great wrath of&#10;Saouy, who riding straight at him endeavoured to take the beautiful&#10;Persian from him by force. Noureddin letting her go, seized Saouy&#39;s&#10;horse by the bridle, and, encouraged by the applause of the&#10;bystanders, dragged him to the ground, beat him severely, and left&#10;him in the gutter streaming with blood. Then, taking the beautiful&#10;Persian, he returned home amidst the acclamations of the people,&#10;who detested Saouy so much that they would neither interfere in his&#10;behalf nor allow his slaves to protect him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Covered from head to foot with mire and streaming with blood he&#10;rose, and leaning on two of his slaves went straight to the palace,&#10;where he demanded an audience of the king, to whom he related what&#10;had taken place in these words:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;May it please your Majesty, I had gone to the slave market to&#10;buy myself a cook. While there I heard a slave being offered for&#10;4,000 pieces. Asking to see her, I found she was of incomparable&#10;beauty, and was being sold by Noureddin, the son of your late&#10;vizir, to whom your Majesty will remember giving a sum of 10,000&#10;gold pieces for the purchase of a slave. This is the identical&#10;slave, whom instead of bringing to your Majesty he gave to his own&#10;son. Since the death of his father this Noureddin has run through&#10;his entire fortune, has sold all his possessions, and is now&#10;reduced to selling the slave. Calling him to me, I said:&#10;&#34;Noureddin, I will give you 10,000 gold pieces for your slave, whom&#10;I will present to the king. I will interest him at the same time in&#10;your behalf, and this will be worth much more to you than what&#10;extra money you might obtain from the merchants.&#34; &#34;Bad old man,&#34; he&#10;exclaimed, &#34;rather than sell my slave to you I would give her to a&#10;Jew.&#34; &#34;But, Noureddin,&#34; I remonstrated, &#34;you do not consider that&#10;in speaking thus you wrong the king, to whom your father owed&#10;everything.&#34; This remonstrance only irritated him the more.&#10;Throwing himself on me like a madman, he tore me from my horse,&#10;beat me to his heart&#39;s content, and left me in the state your&#10;Majesty sees.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So saying Saouy turned aside his head and wept bitterly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The king&#39;s wrath was kindled against Noureddin. He ordered the&#10;captain of the guard to take with him forty men, to pillage&#10;Noureddin&#39;s house, to rase it to the ground, and to bring Noureddin&#10;and the slave to him. A doorkeeper, named Sangiar, who had been a&#10;slave of Khacan&#39;s, hearing this order given, slipped out of the&#10;king&#39;s apartment, and hastened to warn Noureddin to take flight&#10;instantly with the beautiful Persian. Then, presenting him with&#10;forty gold pieces, he disappeared before Noureddin had time to&#10;thank him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As soon, then, as the fair Persian had put on her veil they fled&#10;together, and had the good fortune to get out of the town without&#10;being observed. At the mouth of the Euphrates they found a ship&#10;just about to start for Bagdad. They embarked, and immediately the&#10;anchor was raised and they set sail.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When the captain of the guard reached Noureddin&#39;s house he&#10;caused his soldiers to burst open the door and to enter by force,&#10;but no trace was to be found of Noureddin and his slave, nor could&#10;the neighbours give any information about them. When the king heard&#10;that they had escaped, he issued a proclamation that a reward of&#10;1,000 gold pieces would be given to whoever would bring him&#10;Noureddin and the slave, but that, on the contrary, whoever hid&#10;them would be severely punished. Meanwhile Noureddin and the fair&#10;Persian had safely reached Bagdad. When the vessel had come to an&#10;anchor they paid five gold pieces for their passage and went&#10;ashore. Never having been in Bagdad before, they did not know where&#10;to seek a lodging. Wandering along the banks of the Tigris, they&#10;skirted a garden enclosed by a high wall. The gate was shut, but in&#10;front of it was an open vestibule with a sofa on either side.&#10;&#34;Here,&#34; said Noureddin, &#34;let us pass the night,&#34; and reclining on&#10;the sofas they soon fell asleep.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now this garden belonged to the Caliph. In the middle of it was&#10;a vast pavilion, whose superb saloon had eighty windows, each&#10;window having a lustre, lit solely when the Caliph spent the&#10;evening there. Only the door-keeper lived there, an old soldier&#10;named Scheih Ibrahim, who had strict orders to be very careful whom&#10;he admitted, and never to allow any one to sit on the sofas by the&#10;door. It happened that evening that he had gone out on an errand.&#10;When he came back and saw two persons asleep on the sofas he was&#10;about to drive them out with blows, but drawing nearer he perceived&#10;that they were a handsome young man and beautiful young woman, and&#10;decided to awake them by gentler means. Noureddin, on being awoke,&#10;told the old man that they were strangers, and merely wished to&#10;pass the night there. &#34;Come with me,&#34; said Scheih Ibrahim, &#34;I will&#10;lodge you better, and will show you a magnificent garden belonging&#10;to me.&#34; So saying the doorkeeper led the way into the Caliph&#39;s&#10;garden, the beauties of which filled them with wonder and&#10;amazement. Noureddin took out two gold pieces, and giving them to&#10;Scheih Ibrahim said&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I beg you to get us something to eat that we may make merry&#10;together.&#34; Being very avaricious, Scheih Ibrahim determined to&#10;spend only the tenth part of the money and to keep the rest to&#10;himself. While he was gone Noureddin and the Persian wandered&#10;through the gardens and went up the white marble staircase of the&#10;pavilion as far as the locked door of the saloon. On the return of&#10;Scheih Ibrahim they begged him to open it, and to allow them to&#10;enter and admire the magnificence within. Consenting, he brought&#10;not only the key, but a light, and immediately unlocked the door.&#10;Noureddin and the Persian entering, were dazzled with the&#10;magnificence they beheld. The paintings and furniture were of&#10;astonishing beauty, and between each window was a silver arm&#10;holding a candle.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Scheih Ibrahim spread the table in front of a sofa, and all&#10;three ate together. When they had finished eating Noureddin asked&#10;the old man to bring them a bottle of wine.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Heaven forbid,&#34; said Scheih Ibrahim, &#34;that I should come in&#10;contact with wine! I who have four times made the pilgrimage to&#10;Mecca, and have renounced wine for ever.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You would, however, do us a great service in procuring us&#10;some,&#34; said Noureddin. &#34;You need not touch it yourself. Take the&#10;ass which is tied to the gate, lead it to the nearest wine-shop,&#10;and ask some passer-by to order two jars of wine; have them put in&#10;the ass&#39;s panniers, and drive him before you. Here are two pieces&#10;of gold for the expenses.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At sight of the gold, Scheih Ibrahim set off at once to execute&#10;the commission. On his return, Noureddin said: &#34;We have still need&#10;of cups to drink from, and of fruit, if you can procure us some.&#34;&#10;Scheih Ibrahim disappeared again, and soon returned with a table&#10;spread with cups of gold and silver, and every sort of beautiful&#10;fruit. Then he withdrew, in spite of repeated invitations to&#10;remain.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Noureddin and the beautiful Persian, finding the wine excellent,&#10;drank of it freely, and while drinking they sang. Both had fine&#10;voices, and Scheih Ibrahim listened to them with great pleasure&#8212;&#10;first from a distance, then he drew nearer, and finally put his&#10;head in at the door. Noureddin, seeing him, called to him to come&#10;in and keep them company. At first the old man declined, but was&#10;persuaded to enter the room, to sit down on the edge of the sofa&#10;nearest the door, and at last to draw closer and to seat himself by&#10;the beautiful Persian, who urged him so persistently to drink her&#10;health that at length he yielded, and took the cup she offered.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now the old man only made a pretence of renouncing wine; he&#10;frequented wine-shops like other people, and had taken none of the&#10;precautions Noureddin had proposed. Having once yielded, he was&#10;easily persuaded to take a second cup, and a third, and so on till&#10;he no longer knew what he was doing. Till near midnight they&#10;continued drinking, laughing, and singing together.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;About that time the Persian, perceiving that the room was lit by&#10;only one miserable tallow candle, asked Scheih Ibrahim to light&#10;some of the beautiful candles in the silver arms.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Light them yourself,&#34; answered the old man; &#34;you are younger&#10;than I, but let five or six be enough.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She did not stop, however, till she had lit all the eighty, but&#10;Scheih Ibrahim was not conscious of this, and when, soon after&#10;that, Noureddin proposed to have some of the lustres lit, he&#10;answered:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You are more capable of lighting them than I, but not more than&#10;three.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Noureddin, far from contenting himself with three, lit all, and&#10;opened all the eighty windows.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Caliph Haroun-al-Raschid, chancing at that moment to open a&#10;window in the saloon of his palace looking on the garden, was&#10;surprised to see the pavilion brilliantly illuminated. Calling the&#10;grand-vizir, Giafar, he said to him:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Negligent vizir, look at the pavilion, and tell me why it is&#10;lit up when I am not there.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When the vizir saw that it was as the Caliph said, he trembled&#10;with fear, and immediately invented an excuse.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Commander of the Faithful,&#34; he said, &#34;I must tell you that four&#10;or five days ago Scheih Ibrahim told me that he wished to have an&#10;assembly of the ministers of his mosque, and asked permission to&#10;hold it in the pavilion. I granted his request, but forgot since to&#10;mention it to your Majesty.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Giafar,&#34; replied the Caliph, &#34;you have committed three faults&#8212;&#10;first, in giving the permission; second, in not mentioning it to&#10;me; and third, in not investigating the matter more closely. For&#10;punishment I condemn you to spend the rest of the night with me in&#10;company of these worthy people. While I dress myself as a citizen,&#10;go and disguise yourself, and then come with me.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When they reached the garden gate they found it open, to the&#10;great indignation of the Caliph. The door of the pavilion being&#10;also open, he went softly upstairs, and looked in at the&#10;half-closed door of the saloon. Great was his surprise to see&#10;Scheih Ibrahim, whose sobriety he had never doubted, drinking and&#10;singing with a young man and a beautiful lady. The Caliph, before&#10;giving way to his anger, determined to watch and see who the people&#10;were and what they did.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Presently Scheih Ibrahim asked the beautiful Persian if anything&#10;were wanting to complete her enjoyment of the evening.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;If only,&#34; she said, &#34;I had an instrument upon which I might&#10;play.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Scheih Ibrahim immediately took a lute from a cup-board and gave&#10;it to the Persian, who began to play on it, singing the while with&#10;such skill and taste that the Caliph was enchanted. When she ceased&#10;he went softly downstairs and said to the vizir:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Never have I heard a finer voice, nor the lute better played. I&#10;am determined to go in and make her play to me.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Commander of the Faithful,&#34; said the vizir, &#34;if Scheih Ibrahim&#10;recognises you he will die of fright.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I should be sorry for that,&#34; answered the Caliph, &#34;and I am&#10;going to take steps to prevent it. Wait here till I return.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now the Caliph had caused a bend in the river to form a lake in&#10;his garden. There the finest fish in the Tigris were to be found,&#10;but fishing was strictly forbidden. It happened that night,&#10;however, that a fisherman had taken advantage of the gate being&#10;open to go in and cast his nets. He was just about to draw them&#10;when he saw the Caliph approaching. Recognising him at once in&#10;spite of his disguise, he threw himself at his feet imploring&#10;forgiveness.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Fear nothing,&#34; said the Caliph, &#34;only rise up and draw thy&#10;nets.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The fisherman did as he was told, and produced five or six fine&#10;fish, of which the Caliph took the two largest. Then he desired the&#10;fisherman to change clothes with him, and in a few minutes the&#10;Caliph was transformed into a fisherman, even to the shoes and the&#10;turban. Taking the two fish in his hand, he returned to the vizir,&#10;who, not recognising him, would have sent him about his business.&#10;Leaving the vizir at the foot of the stairs, the Caliph went up and&#10;knocked at the door of the saloon. Noureddin opened it, and the&#10;Caliph, standing on the threshold, said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Scheih Ibrahim, I am the fisher Kerim. Seeing that you are&#10;feasting with your friends, I bring you these fish.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Noureddin and the Persian said that when the fishes were&#10;properly cooked and dressed they would gladly eat of them. The&#10;Caliph then returned to the vizir, and they set to work in Scheih&#10;Ibrahim&#39;s house to cook the fish, of which they made so tempting a&#10;dish that Noureddin and the fair Persian ate of it with great&#10;relish. When they had finished Noureddin took thirty gold pieces&#10;(all that remained of what Sangiar had given him) and presented&#10;them to the Caliph, who, thanking him, asked as a further favour if&#10;the lady would play him one piece on the lute. The Persian gladly&#10;consented, and sang and played so as to delight the Caliph.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Noureddin, in the habit of giving to others whatever they&#10;admired, said, &#34;Fisherman, as she pleases you so much, take her;&#10;she is yours.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The fair Persian, astounded that he should wish to part from&#10;her, took her lute, and with tears in her eyes sang her reproaches&#10;to its music.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Caliph (still in the character of fisherman) said to him,&#10;&#34;Sir, I perceive that this fair lady is your slave. Oblige me, I&#10;beg you, by relating your history.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Noureddin willingly granted this request, and recounted&#10;everything from the purchase of the slave down to the present&#10;moment.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And where do you go now?&#34; asked the Caliph.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Wherever the hand of Allah leads me,&#34; said Noureddin.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Then, if you will listen to me,&#34; said the Caliph, &#34;you will&#10;immediately return to Balsora. I will give you a letter to the&#10;king, which will ensure you a good reception from him.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It is an unheard-of thing,&#34; said Noureddin, &#34;that a fisherman&#10;should be in correspondence with a king.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Let not that astonish you,&#34; answered the Caliph; &#34;we studied&#10;together, and have always remained the best of friends, though&#10;fortune, while making him a king, left me a humble fisherman.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Caliph then took a sheet of paper, and wrote the following&#10;letter, at the top of which he put in very small characters this&#10;formula to show that he must be implicitly obeyed:&#8212;&#34;In the name of&#10;the Most Merciful God.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Letter of the Caliph Haroun-al-Raschid to the King of&#10;Balsora.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Haroun-al-Raschid, son of Mahdi, sends this letter to Mohammed&#10;Zinebi, his cousin. As soon as Noureddin, son of the Vizir Khacan,&#10;bearer of this letter, has given it to thee, and thou hast read it,&#10;take off thy royal mantle, put it on his shoulders, and seat him in&#10;thy place without fail. Farewell.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Caliph then gave this letter to Noureddin, who immediately&#10;set off, with only what little money he possessed when Sangiar came&#10;to his assistance. The beautiful Persian, inconsolable at his&#10;departure, sank on a sofa bathed in tears.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When Noureddin had left the room, Scheih Ibrahim, who had&#10;hitherto kept silence, said: &#34;Kerim, for two miserable fish thou&#10;hast received a purse and a slave. I tell thee I will take the&#10;slave, and as to the purse, if it contains silver thou mayst keep&#10;one piece, if gold then I will take all and give thee what copper&#10;pieces I have in my purse.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now here it must be related that when the Caliph went upstairs&#10;with the plate of fish he ordered the vizir to hasten to the palace&#10;and bring back four slaves bearing a change of raiment, who should&#10;wait outside the pavilion till the Caliph should clap his&#10;hands.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Still personating the fisherman, the Caliph answered: &#34;Scheih&#10;Ibrahim, whatever is in the purse I will share equally with you,&#10;but as to the slave I will keep her for myself. If you do not agree&#10;to these conditions you shall have nothing.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The old man, furious at this insolence as he considered it, took&#10;a cup and threw it at the Caliph, who easily avoided a missile from&#10;the hand of a drunken man. It hit against the wall, and broke into&#10;a thousand pieces. Scheih Ibrahim, still more enraged, then went&#10;ont to fetch a stick. The Caliph at that moment clapped his hands,&#10;and the vizir and the four slaves entering took off the fisherman&#39;s&#10;dress and put on him that which they had brought.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When Scheih Ibrahim returned, a thick stick in his hand, the&#10;Caliph was seated on his throne, and nothing remained of the&#10;fisherman but his clothes in the middle of the room. Throwing&#10;himself on the ground at the Caliph&#39;s feet, he said: &#34;Commander of&#10;the Faithful, your miserable slave has offended you, and craves&#10;forgiveness.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Caliph came down from his throne, and said: &#34;Rise, I forgive&#10;thee.&#34; Then turning to the Persian he said: &#34;Fair lady, now you&#10;know who I am; learn also that I have sent Noureddin to Balsora to&#10;be king, and as soon as all necessary preparations are made I will&#10;send you there to be queen. Meanwhile I will give you an apartment&#10;in my palace, where you will be treated with all honour.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At this the beautiful Persian took courage, and the Caliph was&#10;as good as his word, recommending her to the care of his wife&#10;Zobeida.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Noureddin made all haste on his journey to Balsora, and on his&#10;arrival there went straight to the palace of the king, of whom he&#10;demanded an audience. It was immediately granted, and holding the&#10;letter high above his head he forced his way through the crowd.&#10;While the king read the letter he changed colour. He would&#10;instantly have executed the Caliph&#39;s order, but first he showed the&#10;letter to Saouy, whose interests were equally at stake with his&#10;own. Pretending that he wished to read it a second time, Saouy&#10;turned aside as if to seek a better light; unperceived by anyone he&#10;tore off the formula from the top of the letter, put it to his&#10;mouth, and swallowed it. Then, turning to the king, he said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Your majesty has no need to obey this letter. The writing is&#10;indeed that of the Caliph, but the formula is absent. Besides, he&#10;has not sent an express with the patent, without which the letter&#10;is useless. Leave all to me, and I will take the consequences.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The king not only listened to the persuasions of Saouy, but gave&#10;Noureddin into his hands. Such a severe bastinado was first&#10;administered to him, that he was left more dead than alive; then&#10;Saouy threw him into the darkest and deepest dungeon, and fed him&#10;only on bread and water. After ten days Saouy determined to put an&#10;end to Noureddin&#39;s life, but dared not without the king&#39;s&#10;authority. To gain this end, he loaded several of his own slaves&#10;with rich gifts, and presented himself at their head to the king,&#10;saying that they were from the new king on his coronation.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What!&#34; said the king; &#34;is that wretch still alive? Go and&#10;behead him at once. I authorise you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Sire,&#34; said Saouy, &#34;I thank your Majesty for the justice you do&#10;me. I would further beg, as Noureddin publicly affronted me, that&#10;the execution might be in front of the palace, and that it might be&#10;proclaimed throughout the city, so that no one may be ignorant of&#10;it.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The king granted these requests, and the announcement caused&#10;universal grief, for the memory of Noureddin&#39;s father was still&#10;fresh in the hearts of his people. Saouy, accompanied by twenty of&#10;his own slaves, went to the prison to fetch Noureddin, whom he&#10;mounted on a wretched horse without a saddle. Arrived at the&#10;palace, Saouy went in to the king, leaving Noureddin in the square,&#10;hemmed in not only by Saouy&#39;s slaves but by the royal guard, who&#10;had great difficulty in preventing the people from rushing in and&#10;rescuing Noureddin. So great was the indignation against Saouy that&#10;if anyone had set the example he would have been stoned on his way&#10;through the streets. Saouy, who witnessed the agitation of the&#10;people from the windows of the king&#39;s privy chambers, called to the&#10;executioner to strike at once. The king, however, ordered him to&#10;delay; not only was he jealous of Saouy&#39;s interference, but he had&#10;another reason. A troop of horsemen was seen at that moment riding&#10;at full gallop towards the square. Saouy suspected who they might&#10;be, and urged the king to give the signal for the execution without&#10;delay, but this the king refused to do till he knew who the&#10;horsemen were.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now, they were the vizir Giafar and his suite arriving at full&#10;speed from Bagdad. For several days after Noureddin&#39;s departure&#10;with the letter the Caliph had forgotten to send the express with&#10;the patent, without which the letter was useless. Hearing a&#10;beautiful voice one day in the women&#39;s part of the palace uttering&#10;lamentations, he was informed that it was the voice of the fair&#10;Persian, and suddenly calling to mind the patent, he sent for&#10;Giafar, and ordered him to make for Balsora with the utmost speed&#8212;&#10;if Noureddin were dead, to hang Saouy; if he were still alive, to&#10;bring him at once to Bagdad along with the king and Saouy.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Giafar rode at full speed through the square, and alighted at&#10;the steps of the palace, where the king came to greet him. The&#10;vizir&#39;s first question was whether Noureddin were still alive. The&#10;king replied that he was, and he was immediately led forth, though&#10;bound hand and foot. By the vizir&#39;s orders his bonds were&#10;immediately undone, and Saouy was tied with the same cords. Next&#10;day Giafar returned to Bagdad, bearing with him the king, Saouy,&#10;and Noureddin.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When the Caliph heard what treatment Noureddin had received, he&#10;authorised him to behead Saouy with his own hands, but he declined&#10;to shed the blood of his enemy, who was forthwith handed over to&#10;the executioner. The Caliph also desired Noureddin to reign over&#10;Balsora, but this, too, he declined, saying that after what had&#10;passed there he preferred never to return, but to enter the service&#10;of the Caliph. He became one of his most intimate courtiers, and&#10;lived long in great happiness with the fair Persian. As to the&#10;king, the Caliph contented himself with sending him back to&#10;Balsora, with the recommendation to be more careful in future in&#10;the choice of his vizir.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 3, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/208', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;There once lived a poor tailor, who had a son called Aladdin, a&#10;careless, idle boy who would do nothing but play all day long in&#10;the streets with little idle boys like himself. This so grieved the&#10;father that he died; yet, in spite of his mother&#39;s tears and&#10;prayers, Aladdin did not mend his ways. One day, when he was&#10;playing in the streets as usual, a stranger asked him his age, and&#10;if he were not the son of Mustapha the tailor.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I am, sir,&#34; replied Aladdin; &#34;but he died a long while&#10;ago.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;On this the stranger, who was a famous African magician, fell on&#10;his neck and kissed him, saying: &#34;I am your uncle, and knew you&#10;from your likeness to my brother. Go to your mother and tell her I&#10;am coming.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Aladdin ran home, and told his mother of his newly found&#10;uncle.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Indeed, child,&#34; she said, &#34;your father had a brother, but I&#10;always thought he was dead.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;However, she prepared supper, and bade Aladdin seek his uncle,&#10;who came laden with wine and fruit. He presently fell down and&#10;kissed the place where Mustapha used to sit, bidding Aladdin&#39;s&#10;mother not to be surprised at not having seen him before, as he had&#10;been forty years out of the country. He then turned to Aladdin, and&#10;asked him his trade, at which the boy hung his head, while his&#10;mother burst into tears. On learning that Aladdin was idle and&#10;would learn no trade, he offered to take a shop for him and stock&#10;it with merchandise. Next day he bought Aladdin a fine suit of&#10;clothes, and took him all over the city, showing him the sights,&#10;and brought him home at nightfall to his mother, who was overjoyed&#10;to see her son so fine.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Next day the magician led Aladdin into some beautiful gardens a&#10;long way outside the city gates. They sat down by a fountain, and&#10;the magician pulled a cake from his girdle, which he divided&#10;between them. They then journeyed onwards till they almost reached&#10;the mountains. Aladdin was so tired that he begged to go back, but&#10;the magician beguiled him with pleasant stories, and led him on in&#10;spite of himself.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At last they came to two mountains divided by a narrow&#10;valley.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;We will go no farther,&#34; said the false uncle. &#34;I will show you&#10;something wonderful; only do you gather up sticks while I kindle a&#10;fire.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When it was lit the magician threw on it a powder he had about&#10;him, at the same time saying some magical words. The earth trembled&#10;a little and opened in front of them, disclosing a square flat&#10;stone with a brass ring in the middle to raise it by. Aladdin tried&#10;to run away, but the magician caught him and gave him a blow that&#10;knocked him down.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What have I done, uncle?&#34; he said piteously; whereupon the&#10;magician said more kindly: &#34;Fear nothing, but obey me. Beneath this&#10;stone lies a treasure which is to be yours, and no one else may&#10;touch it, so you must do exactly as I tell you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At the word treasure, Aladdin forgot his fears, and grasped the&#10;ring as he was told, saying the names of his father and&#10;grandfather. The stone came up quite easily and some steps&#10;appeared.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Go down,&#34; said the magician; &#34;at the foot of those steps you&#10;will find an open door leading into three large halls. Tuck up your&#10;gown and go through them without touching anything, or you will die&#10;instantly. These halls lead into a garden of fine fruit trees. Walk&#10;on till you come to a niche in a terrace where stands a lighted&#10;lamp. Pour out the oil it contains and bring it to me.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He drew a ring from his finger and gave it to Aladdin, bidding&#10;him prosper.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Aladdin found everything as the magician had said, gathered some&#10;fruit off the trees, and, having got the lamp, arrived at the mouth&#10;of the cave. The magician cried out in a great hurry:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Make haste and give me the lamp.&#34; This Aladdin refused to do&#10;until he was out of the cave. The magician flew into a terrible&#10;passion, and throwing some more powder on the fire, he said&#10;something, and the stone rolled back into its place.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The magician left Persia for ever, which plainly showed that he&#10;was no uncle of Aladdin&#39;s, but a cunning magician who had read in&#10;his magic books of a wonderful lamp, which would make him the most&#10;powerful man in the world. Though he alone knew where to find it,&#10;he could only receive it from the hand of another. He had picked&#10;out the foolish Aladdin for this purpose, intending to get the lamp&#10;and kill him afterwards.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For two days Aladdin remained in the dark, crying and lamenting.&#10;At last he clasped his hands in prayer, and in so doing rubbed the&#10;ring, which the magician had forgotten to take from him.&#10;Immediately an enormous and frightful genie rose out of the earth,&#10;saying:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What wouldst thou with me? I am the Slave of the Ring, and will&#10;obey thee in all things.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Aladdin fearlessly replied: &#34;Deliver me from this place!&#34;&#10;whereupon the earth opened, and he found himself outside. As soon&#10;as his eyes could bear the light he went home, but fainted on the&#10;threshold. When he came to himself he told his mother what had&#10;passed, and showed her the lamp and the fruits he had gathered in&#10;the garden, which were in reality precious stones. He then asked&#10;for some food.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Alas! child,&#34; she said, &#34;I have nothing in the house, but I&#10;have spun a little cotton and will go and sell it.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Aladdin bade her keep her cotton, for he would sell the lamp&#10;instead. As it was very dirty she began to rub it, that it might&#10;fetch a higher price. Instantly a hideous genie appeared, and asked&#10;what she would have. She fainted away, but Aladdin, snatching the&#10;lamp, said boldly:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Fetch me something to eat!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The genie returned with a silver bowl, twelve silver plates&#10;containing rich meats, two silver cups, and two bottles of wine.&#10;Aladdin&#39;s mother, when she came to herself, said:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Whence comes this splendid feast?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ask not, but eat,&#34; replied Aladdin.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So they sat at breakfast till it was dinner-time, and Aladdin&#10;told his mother about the lamp. She begged him to sell it, and have&#10;nothing to do with devils.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No,&#34; said Aladdin, &#34;since chance has made us aware of its&#10;virtues, we will use it and the ring likewise, which I shall always&#10;wear on my finger.&#34; When they had eaten all the genie had brought,&#10;Aladdin sold one of the silver plates, and so on till none were&#10;left. He then had recourse to the genie, who gave him another set&#10;of plates, and thus they lived for many years.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;One day Aladdin heard an order from the Sultan proclaimed that&#10;everyone was to stay at home and close his shutters while the&#10;princess, his daughter, went to and from the bath. Aladdin was&#10;seized by a desire to see her face, which was very difficult, as&#10;she always went veiled. He hid himself behind the door of the bath,&#10;and peeped through a chink. The princess lifted her veil as she&#10;went in, and looked so beautiful that Aladdin fell in love with her&#10;at first sight. He went home so changed that his mother was&#10;frightened. He told her he loved the princess so deeply that he&#10;could not live without her, and meant to ask her in marriage of her&#10;father. His mother, on hearing this, burst out laughing, but&#10;Aladdin at last prevailed upon her to go before the Sultan and&#10;carry his request. She fetched a napkin and laid in it the magic&#10;fruits from the enchanted garden, which sparkled and shone like the&#10;most beautiful jewels. She took these with her to please the&#10;Sultan, and set out, trusting in the lamp. The grand-vizir and the&#10;lords of council had just gone in as she entered the hall and&#10;placed herself in front of the Sultan. He, however, took no notice&#10;of her. She went every day for a week, and stood in the same&#10;place.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When the council broke up on the sixth day the Sultan said to&#10;his vizir: &#34;I see a certain woman in the audience-chamber every day&#10;carrying something in a napkin. Call her next time, that I may find&#10;out what she wants.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Next day, at a sign from the vizir, she went up to the foot of&#10;the throne, and remained kneeling till the Sultan said to her:&#10;&#34;Rise, good woman, and tell me what you want.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She hesitated, so the Sultan sent away all but the vizir, and&#10;bade her speak freely, promising to forgive her beforehand for&#10;anything she might say. She then told him of her son&#39;s violent love&#10;for the princess.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I prayed him to forget her,&#34; she said, &#34;but in vain; he&#10;threatened to do some desperate deed if I refused to go and ask&#10;your Majesty for the hand of the princess. Now I pray you to&#10;forgive not me alone, but my son Aladdin.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Sultan asked her kindly what she had in the napkin,&#10;whereupon she unfolded the jewels and presented them.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He was thunderstruck, and turning to the vizir said: &#34;What&#10;sayest thou? Ought I not to bestow the princess on one who values&#10;her at such a price?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The vizir, who wanted her for his own son, begged the Sultan to&#10;withhold her for three months, in the course of which he hoped his&#10;son would contrive to make him a richer present. The Sultan granted&#10;this, and told Aladdin&#39;s mother that, though he consented to the&#10;marriage, she must not appear before him again for three&#10;months.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Aladdin waited patiently for nearly three months, but after two&#10;had elapsed his mother, going into the city to buy oil, found&#10;everyone rejoicing, and asked what was going on.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Do you not know,&#34; was the answer, &#34;that the son of the&#10;grand-vizir is to marry the Sultan&#39;s daughter to-night?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Breathless, she ran and told Aladdin, who was overwhelmed at&#10;first, but presently bethought him of the lamp. He rubbed it, and&#10;the genie appeared, saying: &#34;What is thy will?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Aladdin replied: &#34;The Sultan, as thou knowest, has broken his&#10;promise to me, and the vizir&#39;s son is to have the princess. My&#10;command is that to-night you bring hither the bride and&#10;bridegroom.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Master, I obey,&#34; said the genie.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Aladdin then went to his chamber, where, sure enough at midnight&#10;the genie transported the bed containing the vizir&#39;s son and the&#10;princess.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Take this new-married man,&#34; he said, &#34;and put him outside in&#10;the cold, and return at daybreak.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Whereupon the genie took the vizir&#39;s son out of bed, leaving&#10;Aladdin with the princess.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Fear nothing,&#34; Aladdin said to her; &#34;you are my wife, promised&#10;to me by your unjust father, and no harm shall come to you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The princess was too frightened to speak, and passed the most&#10;miserable night of her life, while Aladdin lay down beside her and&#10;slept soundly. At the appointed hour the genie fetched in the&#10;shivering bridegroom, laid him in his place, and transported the&#10;bed back to the palace.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Presently the Sultan came to wish his daughter good-morning. The&#10;unhappy vizir&#39;s son jumped up and hid himself, while the princess&#10;would not say a word, and was very sorrowful.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Sultan sent her mother to her, who said: &#34;How comes it,&#10;child, that you will not speak to your father? What has&#10;happened?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The princess sighed deeply, and at last told her mother how,&#10;during the night, the bed had been carried into some strange house,&#10;and what had passed there. Her mother did not believe her in the&#10;least, but bade her rise and consider it an idle dream.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The following night exactly the same thing happened, and next&#10;morning, on the princess&#39;s refusing to speak, the Sultan threatened&#10;to cut off her head. She then confessed all, bidding him ask the&#10;vizir&#39;s son if it were not so. The Sultan told the vizir to ask his&#10;son, who owned the truth, adding that, dearly as he loved the&#10;princess, he had rather die than go through another such fearful&#10;night, and wished to be separated from her. His wish was granted,&#10;and there was an end of feasting and rejoicing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When the three months were over, Aladdin sent his mother to&#10;remind the Sultan of his promise. She stood in the same place as&#10;before, and the Sultan, who had forgotten Aladdin, at once&#10;remembered him, and sent for her. On seeing her poverty the Sultan&#10;felt less inclined than ever to keep his word, and asked the&#10;vizir&#39;s advice, who counselled him to set so high a value on the&#10;princess that no man living could come up to it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Sultan then turned to Aladdin&#39;s mother, saying: &#34;Good woman,&#10;a Sultan must remember his promises, and I will remember mine, but&#10;your son must first send me forty basins of gold brimful of jewels,&#10;carried by forty black slaves, led by as many white ones,&#10;splendidly dressed. Tell him that I await his answer.&#34; The mother&#10;of Aladdin bowed low and went home, thinking all was lost.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She gave Aladdin the message, adding: &#34;He may wait long enough&#10;for your answer!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Not so long, mother, as you think,&#34; her son replied &#34;I would do&#10;a great deal more than that for the princess.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He summoned the genie, and in a few moments the eighty slaves&#10;arrived, and filled up the small house and garden.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Aladdin made them set out to the palace, two and two, followed&#10;by his mother. They were so richly dressed, with such splendid&#10;jewels in their girdles, that everyone crowded to see them and the&#10;basins of gold they carried on their heads.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;They entered the palace, and, after kneeling before the Sultan,&#10;stood in a half-circle round the throne with their arms crossed,&#10;while Aladdin&#39;s mother presented them to the Sultan.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He hesitated no longer, but said: &#34;Good woman, return and tell&#10;your son that I wait for him with open arms.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She lost no time in telling Aladdin, bidding him make haste. But&#10;Aladdin first called the genie.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I want a scented bath,&#34; he said, &#34;a richly embroidered habit, a&#10;horse surpassing the Sultan&#39;s, and twenty slaves to attend me.&#10;Besides this, six slaves, beautifully dressed, to wait on my&#10;mother; and lastly, ten thousand pieces of gold in ten purses.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;No sooner said than done. Aladdin mounted his horse and passed&#10;through the streets, the slaves strewing gold as they went. Those&#10;who had played with him in his childhood knew him not, he had grown&#10;so handsome.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When the Sultan saw him he came down from his throne, embraced&#10;him, and led him into a hall where a feast was spread, intending to&#10;marry him to the princess that very day.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But Aladdin refused, saying, &#34;I must build a palace fit for&#10;her,&#34; and took his leave.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Once home he said to the genie: &#34;Build me a palace of the finest&#10;marble, set with jasper, agate, and other precious stones. In the&#10;middle you shall build me a large hall with a dome, its four walls&#10;of massy gold and silver, each side having six windows, whose&#10;lattices, all except one, which is to be left unfinished, must be&#10;set with diamonds and rubies. There must be stables and horses and&#10;grooms and slaves; go and see about it!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The palace was finished by next day, and the genie carried him&#10;there and showed him all his orders faithfully carried out, even to&#10;the laying of a velvet carpet from Aladdin&#39;s palace to the&#10;Sultan&#39;s. Aladdin&#39;s mother then dressed herself carefully, and&#10;walked to the palace with her slaves, while he followed her on&#10;horseback. The Sultan sent musicians with trumpets and cymbals to&#10;meet them, so that the air resounded with music and cheers. She was&#10;taken to the princess, who saluted her and treated her with great&#10;honour. At night the princess said good-bye to her father, and set&#10;out on the carpet for Aladdin&#39;s palace, with his mother at her&#10;side, and followed by the hundred slaves. She was charmed at the&#10;sight of Aladdin, who ran to receive her.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Princess,&#34; he said, &#34;blame your beauty for my boldness if I&#10;have displeased you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She told him that, having seen him, she willingly obeyed her&#10;father in this matter. After the wedding had taken place Aladdin&#10;led her into the hall, where a feast was spread, and she supped&#10;with him, after which they danced till midnight.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Next day Aladdin invited the Sultan to see the palace. On&#10;entering the hall with the four-and-twenty windows, with their&#10;rubies, diamonds, and emeralds, he cried:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It is a world&#39;s wonder! There is only one thing that surprises&#10;me. Was it by accident that one window was left unfinished?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No, sir, by design,&#34; returned Aladdin. &#34;I wished your Majesty&#10;to have the glory of finishing this palace.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Sultan was pleased, and sent for the best jewelers in the&#10;city. He showed them the unfinished window, and bade them fit it up&#10;like the others.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Sir,&#34; replied their spokesman, &#34;we cannot find jewels&#10;enough.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Sultan had his own fetched, which they soon used, but to no&#10;purpose, for in a month&#39;s time the work was not half done. Aladdin,&#10;knowing that their task was vain, bade them undo their work and&#10;carry the jewels back, and the genie finished the window at his&#10;command. The Sultan was surprised to receive his jewels again and&#10;visited Aladdin, who showed him the window finished. The Sultan&#10;embraced him, the envious vizir meanwhile hinting that it was the&#10;work of enchantment.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Aladdin had won the hearts of the people by his gentle bearing.&#10;He was made captain of the Sultan&#39;s armies, and won several battles&#10;for him, but remained modest and courteous as before, and lived&#10;thus in peace and content for several years.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But far away in Africa the magician remembered Aladdin, and by&#10;his magic arts discovered that Aladdin, instead of perishing&#10;miserably in the cave, had escaped, and had married a princess,&#10;with whom he was living in great honour and wealth. He knew that&#10;the poor tailor&#39;s son could only have accomplished this by means of&#10;the lamp, and travelled night and day till he reached the capital&#10;of China, bent on Aladdin&#39;s ruin. As he passed through the town he&#10;heard people talking everywhere about a marvellous palace.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Forgive my ignorance,&#34; he asked, &#34;what is this palace you speak&#10;of?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Have you not heard of Prince Aladdin&#39;s palace,&#34; was the reply,&#10;&#34;the greatest wonder of the world? I will direct you if you have a&#10;mind to see it.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The magician thanked him who spoke, and having seen the palace&#10;knew that it had been raised by the genie of the lamp, and became&#10;half mad with rage. He determined to get hold of the lamp, and&#10;again plunge Aladdin into the deepest poverty.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Unluckily, Aladdin had gone a-hunting for eight days, which gave&#10;the magician plenty of time. He bought a dozen copper lamps, put&#10;them into a basket, and went to the palace, crying: &#34;New lamps for&#10;old!&#34; followed by a jeering crowd.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The princess, sitting in the hall of four-and-twenty windows,&#10;sent a slave to find out what the noise was about, who came back&#10;laughing, so that the princess scolded her.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Madam,&#34; replied the slave, &#34;who can help laughing to see an old&#10;fool offering to exchange fine new lamps for old ones?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Another slave, hearing this, said: &#34;There is an old one on the&#10;cornice there which he can have.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now this was the magic lamp, which Aladdin had left there, as he&#10;could not take it out hunting with him. The princess, not knowing&#10;its value, laughingly bade the slave take it and make the&#10;exchange.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She went and said to the magician: &#34;Give me a new lamp for&#10;this.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He snatched it and bade the slave take her choice, amid the&#10;jeers of the crowd. Little he cared, but left off crying his lamps,&#10;and went out of the city gates to a lonely place, where he remained&#10;till nightfall, when he pulled out the lamp and rubbed it. The&#10;genie appeared, and at the magician&#39;s command carried him, together&#10;with the palace and the princess in it, to a lonely place in&#10;Africa.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Next morning the Sultan looked out of the window towards&#10;Aladdin&#39;s palace and rubbed his eyes, for it was gone. He sent for&#10;the vizir, and asked what had become of the palace. The vizir&#10;looked out too, and was lost in astonishment. He again put it down&#10;to enchantment, and this time the Sultan believed him, and sent&#10;thirty men on horseback to fetch Aladdin in chains. They met him&#10;riding home, bound him, and forced him to go with them on foot. The&#10;people, however, who loved him, followed, armed, to see that he&#10;came to no harm. He was carried before the Sultan, who ordered the&#10;executioner to cut off his head. The executioner made Aladdin kneel&#10;down, bandaged his eyes, and raised his scimitar to strike.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At that instant the vizir, who saw that the crowd had forced&#10;their way into the courtyard and were scaling the walls to rescue&#10;Aladdin, called to the executioner to stay his hand. The people,&#10;indeed, looked so threatening that the Sultan gave way and ordered&#10;Aladdin to be unbound, and pardoned him in the sight of the&#10;crowd.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Aladdin now begged to know what he had done.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;False wretch!&#34; said the Sultan, &#34;come hither,&#34; and showed him&#10;from the window the place where his palace had stood.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Aladdin was so amazed that he could not say a word.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Where is my palace and my daughter?&#34; demanded the Sultan. &#34;For&#10;the first I am not so deeply concerned, but my daughter I must&#10;have, and you must find her or lose your head.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Aladdin begged for forty days in which to find her, promising if&#10;he failed to return and suffer death at the Sultan&#39;s pleasure. His&#10;prayer was granted, and he went forth sadly from the Sultan&#39;s&#10;presence. For three days he wandered about like a madman, asking&#10;everyone what had become of his palace, but they only laughed and&#10;pitied him. He came to the banks of a river, and knelt down to say&#10;his prayers before throwing himself in. In so doing he rubbed the&#10;magic ring he still wore.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The genie he had seen in the cave appeared, and asked his&#10;will.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Save my life, genie,&#34; said Aladdin, &#34;and bring my palace&#10;back.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That is not in my power,&#34; said the genie; &#34;I am only the slave&#10;of the ring; you must ask the slave of the lamp.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Even so,&#34; said Aladdin &#34;but thou canst take me to the palace,&#10;and set me down under my dear wife&#39;s window.&#34; He at once found&#10;himself in Africa, under the window of the princess, and fell&#10;asleep out of sheer weariness.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He was awakened by the singing of the birds, and his heart was&#10;lighter. He saw plainly that all his misfortunes were owing to the&#10;loss of the lamp, and vainly wondered who had robbed him of it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;That morning the princess rose earlier than she had done since&#10;she had been carried into Africa by the magician, whose company she&#10;was forced to endure once a day. She, however, treated him so&#10;harshly that he dared not live there altogether. As she was&#10;dressing, one of her women looked out and saw Aladdin. The princess&#10;ran and opened the window, and at the noise she made Aladdin looked&#10;up. She called to him to come to her, and great was the joy of&#10;these lovers at seeing each other again.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;After he had kissed her Aladdin said: &#34;I beg of you, Princess,&#10;in God&#39;s name, before we speak of anything else, for your own sake&#10;and mine, tell me what has become of an old lamp I left on the&#10;cornice in the hall of four-and-twenty windows, when I went&#10;a-hunting.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Alas!&#34; she said &#34;I am the innocent cause of our sorrows,&#34; and&#10;told him of the exchange of the lamp.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Now I know,&#34; cried Aladdin, &#34;that we have to thank the African&#10;magician for this! Where is the lamp?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;He carries it about with him,&#34; said the princess, &#34;I know, for&#10;he pulled it out of his breast to show me. He wishes me to break my&#10;faith with you and marry him, saying that you were beheaded by my&#10;father&#39;s command. He is forever speaking ill of you, but I only&#10;reply by my tears. If I persist, I doubt not that he will use&#10;violence.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Aladdin comforted her, and left her for a while. He changed&#10;clothes with the first person he met in the town, and having bought&#10;a certain powder returned to the princess, who let him in by a&#10;little side door.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Put on your most beautiful dress,&#34; he said to her, &#34;and receive&#10;the magician with smiles, leading him to believe that you have&#10;forgotten me. Invite him to sup with you, and say you wish to taste&#10;the wine of his country. He will go for some, and while he is gone&#10;I will tell you what to do.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;She listened carefully to Aladdin, and when he left her arrayed&#10;herself gaily for the first time since she left China. She put on a&#10;girdle and head-dress of diamonds, and seeing in a glass that she&#10;looked more beautiful than ever, received the magician, saying to&#10;his great amazement: &#34;I have made up my mind that Aladdin is dead,&#10;and that all my tears will not bring him back to me, so I am&#10;resolved to mourn no more, and have therefore invited you to sup&#10;with me; but I am tired of the wines of China, and would fain taste&#10;those of Africa.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The magician flew to his cellar, and the princess put the powder&#10;Aladdin had given her in her cup. When he returned she asked him to&#10;drink her health in the wine of Africa, handing him her cup in&#10;exchange for his as a sign she was reconciled to him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Before drinking the magician made her a speech in praise of her&#10;beauty, but the princess cut him short saying:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Let me drink first, and you shall say what you will&#10;afterwards.&#34; She set her cup to her lips and kept it there, while&#10;the magician drained his to the dregs and fell back lifeless.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The princess then opened the door to Aladdin, and flung her arms&#10;round his neck, but Aladdin put her away, bidding her to leave him,&#10;as he had more to do. He then went to the dead magician, took the&#10;lamp out of his vest, and bade the genie carry the palace and all&#10;in it back to China. This was done, and the princess in her chamber&#10;only felt two little shocks, and little thought she was at home&#10;again.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Sultan, who was sitting in his closet, mourning for his lost&#10;daughter, happened to look up, and rubbed his eyes, for there stood&#10;the palace as before! He hastened thither, and Aladdin received him&#10;in the hall of the four-and-twenty windows, with the princess at&#10;his side. Aladdin told him what had happened, and showed him the&#10;dead body of the magician, that he might believe. A ten days&#39; feast&#10;was proclaimed, and it seemed as if Aladdin might now live the rest&#10;of his life in peace; but it was not to be.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The African magician had a younger brother, who was, if&#10;possible, more wicked and more cunning than himself. He travelled&#10;to China to avenge his brother&#39;s death, and went to visit a pious&#10;woman called Fatima, thinking she might be of use to him. He&#10;entered her cell and clapped a dagger to her breast, telling her to&#10;rise and do his bidding on pain of death. He changed clothes with&#10;her, coloured his face like hers, put on her veil and murdered her,&#10;that she might tell no tales. Then he went towards the palace of&#10;Aladdin, and all the people thinking he was the holy woman,&#10;gathered round him, kissing his hands and begging his blessing.&#10;When he got to the palace there was such a noise going on round him&#10;that the princess bade her slave look out of the window and ask&#10;what was the matter. The slave said it was the holy woman, curing&#10;people by her touch of their ailments, whereupon the princess, who&#10;had long desired to see Fatima, sent for her. On coming to the&#10;princess the magician offered up a prayer for her health and&#10;prosperity. When he had done the princess made him sit by her, and&#10;begged him to stay with her always. The false Fatima, who wished&#10;for nothing better, consented, but kept his veil down for fear of&#10;discovery. The princess showed him the hall, and asked him what he&#10;thought of it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It is truly beautiful,&#34; said the false Fatima. &#34;In my mind it&#10;wants but one thing.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And what is that?&#34; said the princess.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;If only a roc&#39;s egg,&#34; replied he, &#34;were hung up from the middle&#10;of this dome, it would be the wonder of the world.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;After this the princess could think of nothing but a roc&#39;s egg,&#10;and when Aladdin returned from hunting he found her in a very ill&#10;humour. He begged to know what was amiss, and she told him that all&#10;her pleasure in the hall was spoilt for the want of a roc&#39;s egg&#10;hanging from the dome.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It that is all,&#34; replied Aladdin, &#34;you shall soon be&#10;happy.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He left her and rubbed the lamp, and when the genie appeared&#10;commanded him to bring a roc&#39;s egg. The genie gave such a loud and&#10;terrible shriek that the hall shook.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Wretch!&#34; he cried, &#34;is it not enough that I have done&#10;everything for you, but you must command me to bring my master and&#10;hang him up in the midst of this dome? You and your wife and your&#10;palace deserve to be burnt to ashes; but this request does not come&#10;from you, but from the brother of the African magician whom you&#10;destroyed. He is now in your palace disguised as the holy&#10;woman&#8212;whom he murdered. He it was who put that wish into your&#10;wife&#39;s head. Take care of yourself, for he means to kill you.&#34; So&#10;saying the genie disappeared.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Aladdin went back to the princess, saying his head ached, and&#10;requesting that the holy Fatima should be fetched to lay her hands&#10;on it. But when the magician came near, Aladdin, seizing his&#10;dagger, pierced him to the heart.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What have you done?&#34; cried the princess. &#34;You have killed the&#10;holy woman!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Not so,&#34; replied Aladdin, &#34;but a wicked magician,&#34; and told her&#10;of how she had been deceived.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;After this Aladdin and his wife lived in peace. He succeeded the&#10;Sultan when he died, and reigned for many years, leaving behind him&#10;a long line of kings.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 3, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/208', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('The Adventures of Haroun-al-Raschid,&#10;Caliph of Bagdad'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Caliph Haroun-al-Raschid sat in his palace, wondering if&#10;there was anything left in the world that could possibly give him a&#10;few hours&#39; amusement, when Giafar the grand-vizir, his old and&#10;tried friend, suddenly appeared before him. Bowing low, he waited,&#10;as was his duty, till his master spoke, but Haroun-al-Raschid&#10;merely turned his head and looked at him, and sank back into his&#10;former weary posture.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now Giafar had something of importance to say to the Caliph, and&#10;had no intention of being put off by mere silence, so with another&#10;low bow in front of the throne, he began to speak.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Commander of the Faithful,&#34; said he, &#34;I have taken on myself to&#10;remind your Highness that you have undertaken secretly to observe&#10;for yourself the manner in which justice is done and order is kept&#10;throughout the city. This is the day you have set apart to devote&#10;to this object, and perhaps in fulfilling this duty you may find&#10;some distraction from the melancholy to which, as I see to my&#10;sorrow, you are a prey.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You are right,&#34; returned the Caliph, &#34;I had forgotten all about&#10;it. Go and change your coat, and I will change mine.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A few moments later they both re-entered the hall, disguised as&#10;foreign merchants, and passed through a secret door, out into the&#10;open country. Here they turned towards the Euphrates, and crossing&#10;the river in a small boat, walked through that part of the town&#10;which lay along the further bank, without seeing anything to call&#10;for their interference. Much pleased with the peace and good order&#10;of the city, the Caliph and his vizir made their way to a bridge,&#10;which led straight back to the palace, and had already crossed it,&#10;when they were stopped by an old and blind man, who begged for&#10;alms.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Caliph gave him a piece of money, and was passing on, but&#10;the blind man seized his hand, and held him fast.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Charitable person,&#34; he said, &#34;whoever you may be grant me yet&#10;another prayer. Strike me, I beg of you, one blow. I have deserved&#10;it richly, and even a more severe penalty.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Caliph, much surprised at this request, replied gently: &#34;My&#10;good man, that which you ask is impossible. Of what use would my&#10;alms be if I treated you so ill?&#34; And as he spoke he tried to&#10;loosen the grasp of the blind beggar.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My lord,&#34; answered the man, &#34;pardon my boldness and my&#10;persistence. Take back your money, or give me the blow which I&#10;crave. I have sworn a solemn oath that I will receive nothing&#10;without receiving chastisement, and if you knew all, you would feel&#10;that the punishment is not a tenth part of what I deserve.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Moved by these words, and perhaps still more by the fact that he&#10;had other business to attend to, the Caliph yielded, and struck him&#10;lightly on the shoulder. Then he continued his road, followed by&#10;the blessing of the blind man. When they were out of earshot, he&#10;said to the vizir, &#34;There must be something very odd to make that&#10;man act so&#8212;I should like to find out what is the reason. Go back to&#10;him; tell him who I am, and order him to come without fail to the&#10;palace to-morrow, after the hour of evening prayer.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So the grand-vizir went back to the bridge; gave the blind&#10;beggar first a piece of money and then a blow, delivered the&#10;Caliph&#39;s message, and rejoined his master.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;They passed on towards the palace, but walking through a square,&#10;they came upon a crowd watching a young and well-dressed man who&#10;was urging a horse at full speed round the open space, using at the&#10;same time his spurs and whip so unmercifully that the animal was&#10;all covered with foam and blood. The Caliph, astonished at this&#10;proceeding, inquired of a passer-by what it all meant, but no one&#10;could tell him anything, except that every day at the same hour the&#10;same thing took place.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Still wondering, he passed on, and for the moment had to content&#10;himself with telling the vizir to command the horseman also to&#10;appear before him at the same time as the blind man.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The next day, after evening prayer, the Caliph entered the hall,&#10;and was followed by the vizir bringing with him the two men of whom&#10;we have spoken, and a third, with whom we have nothing to do. They&#10;all bowed themselves low before the throne and then the Caliph bade&#10;them rise, and ask the blind man his name.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Baba-Abdalla, your Highness,&#34; said he.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Baba-Abdalla,&#34; returned the Caliph, &#34;your way of asking alms&#10;yesterday seemed to me so strange, that I almost commanded you then&#10;and there to cease from causing such a public scandal. But I have&#10;sent for you to inquire what was your motive in making such a&#10;curious vow. When I know the reason I shall be able to judge&#10;whether you can be permitted to continue to practise it, for I&#10;cannot help thinking that it sets a very bad example to others.&#10;Tell me therefore the whole truth, and conceal nothing.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;These words troubled the heart of Baba-Abdalla, who prostrated&#10;himself at the feet of the Caliph. Then rising, he answered:&#10;&#34;Commander of the Faithful, I crave your pardon humbly, for my&#10;persistence in beseeching your Highness to do an action which&#10;appears on the face of it to be without any meaning. No doubt, in&#10;the eyes of men, it has none; but I look on it as a slight&#10;expiation for a fearful sin of which I have been guilty, and if&#10;your Highness will deign to listen to my tale, you will see that no&#10;punishment could atone for the crime.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 3, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/208', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('Story of the Blind Baba-Abdalla'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;I was born, Commander of the Faithful, in Bagdad, and was left&#10;an orphan while I was yet a very young man, for my parents died&#10;within a few days of each other. I had inherited from them a small&#10;fortune, which I worked hard night and day to increase, till at&#10;last I found myself the owner of eighty camels. These I hired out&#10;to travelling merchants, whom I frequently accompanied on their&#10;various journeys, and always returned with large profits.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;One day I was coming back from Balsora, whither I had taken a&#10;supply of goods, intended for India, and halted at noon in a lonely&#10;place, which promised rich pasture for my camels. I was resting in&#10;the shade under a tree, when a dervish, going on foot towards&#10;Balsora, sat down by my side, and I inquired whence he had come and&#10;to what place he was going. We soon made friends, and after we had&#10;asked each other the usual questions, we produced the food we had&#10;with us, and satisfied our hunger.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;While we were eating, the dervish happened to mention that in a&#10;spot only a little way off from where we were sitting, there was&#10;hidden a treasure so great that if my eighty camels were loaded&#10;till they could carry no more, the hiding place would seem as full&#10;as if it had never been touched.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At this news I became almost beside myself with joy and greed,&#10;and I flung my arms round the neck of the dervish, exclaiming:&#10;&#34;Good dervish, I see plainly that the riches of this world are&#10;nothing to you, therefore of what use is the knowledge of this&#10;treasure to you? Alone and on foot, you could carry away a mere&#10;handful. But tell me where it is, and I will load my eighty camels&#10;with it, and give you one of them as a token of my gratitude.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Certainly my offer does not sound very magnificent, but it was&#10;great to me, for at his words a wave of covetousness had swept over&#10;my heart, and I almost felt as if the seventy-nine camels that were&#10;left were nothing in comparison.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The dervish saw quite well what was passing in my mind, but he&#10;did not show what he thought of my proposal.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My brother,&#34; he answered quietly, &#34;you know as well as I do,&#10;that you are behaving unjustly. It was open to me to keep my&#10;secret, and to reserve the treasure for myself. But the fact that I&#10;have told you of its existence shows that I had confidence in you,&#10;and that I hoped to earn your gratitude for ever, by making your&#10;fortune as well as mine. But before I reveal to you the secret of&#10;the treasure, you must swear that, after we have loaded the camels&#10;with as much as they can carry, you will give half to me, and let&#10;us go our own ways. I think you will see that this is fair, for if&#10;you present me with forty camels, I on my side will give you the&#10;means of buying a thousand more.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I could not of course deny that what the dervish said was&#10;perfectly reasonable, but, in spite of that, the thought that the&#10;dervish would be as rich as I was unbearable to me. Still there was&#10;no use in discussing the matter, and I had to accept his conditions&#10;or bewail to the end of my life the loss of immense wealth. So I&#10;collected my camels and we set out together under the guidance of&#10;the dervish. After walking some time, we reached what looked like a&#10;valley, but with such a narrow entrance that my camels could only&#10;pass one by one. The little valley, or open space, was shut up by&#10;two mountains, whose sides were formed of straight cliffs, which no&#10;human being could climb.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When we were exactly between these mountains the dervish&#10;stopped.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Make your camels lie down in this open space,&#34; he said, &#34;so&#10;that we can easily load them; then we will go to the treasure.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I did what I was bid, and rejoined the dervish, whom I found&#10;trying to kindle a fire out of some dry wood. As soon as it was&#10;alight, he threw on it a handful of perfumes, and pronounced a few&#10;words that I did not understand, and immediately a thick column of&#10;smoke rose high into the air. He separated the smoke into two&#10;columns, and then I saw a rock, which stood like a pillar between&#10;the two mountains, slowly open, and a splendid palace appear&#10;within.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But, Commander of the Faithful, the love of gold had taken such&#10;possession of my heart, that I could not even stop to examine the&#10;riches, but fell upon the first pile of gold within my reach and&#10;began to heap it into a sack that I had brought with me.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The dervish likewise set to work, but I soon noticed that he&#10;confined himself to collecting precious stones, and I felt I should&#10;be wise to follow his example. At length the camels were loaded&#10;with as much as they could carry, and nothing remained but to seal&#10;up the treasure, and go our ways.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Before, however, this was done, the dervish went up to a great&#10;golden vase, beautifully chased, and took from it a small wooden&#10;box, which he hid in the bosom of his dress, merely saying that it&#10;contained a special kind of ointment. Then he once more kindled the&#10;fire, threw on the perfume, and murmured the unknown spell, and the&#10;rock closed, and stood whole as before.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The next thing was to divide the camels, and to charge them with&#10;the treasure, after which we each took command of our own and&#10;marched out of the valley, till we reached the place in the high&#10;road where the routes diverge, and then we parted, the dervish&#10;going towards Balsora, and I to Bagdad. We embraced each other&#10;tenderly, and I poured out my gratitude for the honour he had done&#10;me, in singling me out for this great wealth, and having said a&#10;hearty farewell we turned our backs, and hastened after our&#10;camels.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I had hardly come up with mine when the demon of envy filled my&#10;soul. &#34;What does a dervish want with riches like that?&#34; I said to&#10;myself. &#34;He alone has the secret of the treasure, and can always&#10;get as much as he wants,&#34; and I halted my camels by the roadside,&#10;and ran back after him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I was a quick runner, and it did not take me very long to come&#10;up with him. &#34;My brother,&#34; I exclaimed, as soon as I could speak,&#10;&#34;almost at the moment of our leave-taking, a reflection occurred to&#10;me, which is perhaps new to you. You are a dervish by profession,&#10;and live a very quiet life, only caring to do good, and careless of&#10;the things of this world. You do not realise the burden that you&#10;lay upon yourself, when you gather into your hands such great&#10;wealth, besides the fact that no one, who is not accustomed to&#10;camels from his birth, can ever manage the stubborn beasts. If you&#10;are wise, you will not encumber yourself with more than thirty, and&#10;you will find those trouble enough.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You are right,&#34; replied the dervish, who understood me quite&#10;well, but did not wish to fight the matter. &#34;I confess I had not&#10;thought about it. Choose any ten you like, and drive them before&#10;you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I selected ten of the best camels, and we proceeded along the&#10;road, to rejoin those I had left behind. I had got what I wanted,&#10;but I had found the dervish so easy to deal with, that I rather&#10;regretted I had not asked for ten more. I looked back. He had only&#10;gone a few paces, and I called after him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My brother,&#34; I said, &#34;I am unwilling to part from you without&#10;pointing out what I think you scarcely grasp, that large experience&#10;of camel-driving is necessary to anybody who intends to keep&#10;together a troop of thirty. In your own interest, I feel sure you&#10;would be much happier if you entrusted ten more of them to me, for&#10;with my practice it is all one to me if I take two or a&#10;hundred.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As before, the dervish made no difficulties, and I drove off my&#10;ten camels in triumph, only leaving him with twenty for his share.&#10;I had now sixty, and anyone might have imagined that I should be&#10;content.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But, Commander of the Faithful, there is a proverb that says,&#10;&#34;the more one has, the more one wants.&#34; So it was with me. I could&#10;not rest as long as one solitary camel remained to the dervish; and&#10;returning to him I redoubled my prayers and embraces, and promises&#10;of eternal gratitude, till the last twenty were in my hands.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Make a good use of them, my brother,&#34; said the holy man.&#10;&#34;Remember riches sometimes have wings if we keep them for&#10;ourselves, and the poor are at our gates expressly that we may help&#10;them.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;My eyes were so blinded by gold, that I paid no heed to his wise&#10;counsel, and only looked about for something else to grasp.&#10;Suddenly I remembered the little box of ointment that the dervish&#10;had hidden, and which most likely contained a treasure more&#10;precious than all the rest. Giving him one last embrace, I observed&#10;accidentally, &#34;What are you going to do with that little box of&#10;ointment? It seems hardly worth taking with you; you might as well&#10;let me have it. And really, a dervish who has given up the world&#10;has no need of ointment!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Oh, if he had only refused my request! But then, supposing he&#10;had, I should have got possession of it by force, so great was the&#10;madness that had laid hold upon me. However, far from refusing it,&#10;the dervish at once held it out, saying gracefully, &#34;Take it, my&#10;friend, and if there is anything else I can do to make you happy&#10;you must let me know.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Directly the box was in my hands I wrenched off the cover. &#34;As&#10;you are so kind,&#34; I said, &#34;tell me, I pray you, what are the&#10;virtues of this ointment?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;They are most curious and interesting,&#34; replied the dervish.&#10;&#34;If you apply a little of it to your left eye you will behold in an&#10;instant all the treasures hidden in the bowels of the earth. But&#10;beware lest you touch your right eye with it, or your sight will be&#10;destroyed for ever.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;His words excited my curiosity to the highest pitch. &#34;Make trial&#10;on me, I implore you,&#34; I cried, holding out the box to the dervish.&#10;&#34;You will know how to do it better than I! I am burning with&#10;impatience to test its charms.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The dervish took the box I had extended to him, and, bidding me&#10;shut my left eye, touched it gently with the ointment. When I&#10;opened it again I saw spread out, as it were before me, treasures&#10;of every kind and without number. But as all this time I had been&#10;obliged to keep my right eye closed, which was very fatiguing, I&#10;begged the dervish to apply the ointment to that eye also.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;If you insist upon it I will do it,&#34; answered the dervish, &#34;but&#10;you must remember what I told you just now&#8212;that if it touches your&#10;right eye you will become blind on the spot.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Unluckily, in spite of my having proved the truth of the&#10;dervish&#39;s words in so many instances, I was firmly convinced that&#10;he was now keeping concealed from me some hidden and precious&#10;virtue of the ointment. So I turned a deaf ear to all he said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My brother,&#34; I replied smiling, &#34;I see you are joking. It is&#10;not natural that the same ointment should have two such exactly&#10;opposite effects.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It is true all the same,&#34; answered the dervish, &#34;and it would&#10;be well for you if you believed my word.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But I would not believe, and, dazzled by the greed of avarice, I&#10;thought that if one eye could show me riches, the other might teach&#10;me how to get possession of them. And I continued to press the&#10;dervish to anoint my right eye, but this he resolutely declined to&#10;do.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;After having conferred such benefits on you,&#34; said he, &#34;I am&#10;loth indeed to work you such evil. Think what it is to be blind,&#10;and do not force me to do what you will repent as long as you&#10;live.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was of no use. &#34;My brother,&#34; I said firmly, &#34;pray say no&#10;more, but do what I ask. You have most generously responded to my&#10;wishes up to this time, do not spoil my recollection of you for a&#10;thing of such little consequence. Let what will happen I take it on&#10;my own head, and will never reproach you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Since you are determined upon it,&#34; he answered with a sigh,&#10;&#34;there is no use talking,&#34; and taking the ointment he laid some on&#10;my right eye, which was tight shut. When I tried to open it heavy&#10;clouds of darkness floated before me. I was as blind as you see me&#10;now!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Miserable dervish!&#34; I shrieked, &#34;so it is true after all! Into&#10;what a bottomless pit has my lust after gold plunged me. Ah, now&#10;that my eyes are closed they are really opened. I know that all my&#10;sufferings are caused by myself alone! But, good brother, you, who&#10;are so kind and charitable, and know the secrets of such vast&#10;learning, have you nothing that will give me back my sight?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Unhappy man,&#34; replied the dervish, &#34;it is not my fault that&#10;this has befallen you, but it is a just chastisement. The blindness&#10;of your heart has wrought the blindness of your body. Yes, I have&#10;secrets; that you have seen in the short time that we have known&#10;each other. But I have none that will give you back your sight. You&#10;have proved yourself unworthy of the riches that were given you.&#10;Now they have passed into my hands, whence they will flow into the&#10;hands of others less greedy and ungrateful than you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The dervish said no more and left me, speechless with shame and&#10;confusion, and so wretched that I stood rooted to the spot, while&#10;he collected the eighty camels and proceeded on his way to Balsora.&#10;It was in vain that I entreated him not to leave me, but at least&#10;to take me within reach of the first passing caravan. He was deaf&#10;to my prayers and cries, and I should soon have been dead of hunger&#10;and misery if some merchants had not come along the track the&#10;following day and kindly brought me back to Bagdad.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;From a rich man I had in one moment become a beggar; and up to&#10;this time I have lived solely on the alms that have been bestowed&#10;on me. But, in order to expiate the sin of avarice, which was my&#10;undoing, I oblige each passer-by to give me a blow.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;This, Commander of the Faithful, is my story.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When the blind man had ended the Caliph addressed him:&#10;&#34;Baba-Abdalla, truly your sin is great, but you have suffered&#10;enough. Henceforth repent in private, for I will see that enough&#10;money is given you day by day for all your wants.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At these words Baba-Abdalla flung himself at the Caliph&#39;s feet,&#10;and prayed that honour and happiness might be his portion for&#10;ever.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 3, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/208', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('The Story of Sidi-Nouman'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Caliph, Haroun-al-Raschid, was much pleased with the tale of&#10;the blind man and the dervish, and when it was finished he turned&#10;to the young man who had ill-treated his horse, and inquired his&#10;name also. The young man replied that he was called&#10;Sidi-Nouman.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Sidi-Nouman,&#34; observed the Caliph, &#34;I have seen horses broken&#10;all my life long, and have even broken them myself, but I have&#10;never seen any horse broken in such a barbarous manner as by you&#10;yesterday. Every one who looked on was indignant, and blamed you&#10;loudly. As for myself, I was so angry that I was very nearly&#10;disclosing who I was, and putting a stop to it at once. Still, you&#10;have not the air of a cruel man, and I would gladly believe that&#10;you did not act in this way without some reason. As I am told that&#10;it was not the first time, and indeed that every day you are to be&#10;seen flogging and spurring your horse, I wish to come to the bottom&#10;of the matter. But tell me the whole truth, and conceal&#10;nothing.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Sidi-Nouman changed colour as he heard these words, and his&#10;manner grew confused; but he saw plainly that there was no help for&#10;it. So he prostrated himself before the throne of the Caliph and&#10;tried to obey, but the words stuck in his throat, and he remained&#10;silent.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Caliph, accustomed though he was to instant obedience,&#10;guessed something of what was passing in the young man&#39;s mind, and&#10;sought to put him at his ease. &#34;Sidi-Nouman,&#34; he said, &#34;do not&#10;think of me as the Caliph, but merely as a friend who would like to&#10;hear your story. If there is anything in it that you are afraid may&#10;offend me, take courage, for I pardon you beforehand. Speak then&#10;openly and without fear, as to one who knows and loves you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Reassured by the kindness of the Caliph, Sidi-Nouman at length&#10;began his tale.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Commander of the Faithful,&#34; said he, &#34;dazzled though I am by&#10;the lustre of your Highness&#39; presence, I will do my best to satisfy&#10;your wishes. I am by no means perfect, but I am not naturally&#10;cruel, neither do I take pleasure in breaking the law. I admit that&#10;the treatment of my horse is calculated to give your Highness a bad&#10;opinion of me, and to set an evil example to others; yet I have not&#10;chastised it without reason, and I have hopes that I shall be&#10;judged more worthy of pity than punishment.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Commander of the Faithful, I will not trouble to describe my&#10;birth; it is not of sufficient distinction to deserve your&#10;Highness&#39; attention. My ancestors were careful people, and I&#10;inherited enough money to enable me to live comfortably, though&#10;without show.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Having therefore a modest fortune, the only thing wanting to my&#10;happiness was a wife who could return my affection, but this&#10;blessing I was not destined to get; for on the very day after my&#10;marriage, my bride began to try my patience in every way that was&#10;most hard to bear.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now, seeing that the customs of our land oblige us to marry&#10;without ever beholding the person with whom we are to pass our&#10;lives, a man has of course no right to complain as long as his wife&#10;is not absolutely repulsive, or is not positively deformed. And&#10;whatever defects her body may have, pleasant ways and good&#10;behaviour will go far to remedy them.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The first time I saw my wife unveiled, when she had been brought&#10;to my house with the usual ceremonies, I was enchanted to find that&#10;I had not been deceived in regard to the account that had been&#10;given me of her beauty. I began my married life in high spirits,&#10;and the best hopes of happiness.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The following day a grand dinner was served to us but as my wife&#10;did not appear, I ordered a servant to call her. Still she did not&#10;come, and I waited impatiently for some time. At last she entered&#10;the room, and she took our places at the table, and plates of rice&#10;were set before us.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I ate mine, as was natural, with a spoon, but great was my&#10;surprise to notice that my wife, instead of doing the same, drew&#10;from her pocket a little case, from which she selected a long pin,&#10;and by the help of this pin conveyed her rice grain by grain to her&#10;mouth.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Amina,&#34; I exclaimed in astonishment, &#34;is that the way you eat&#10;rice at home? And did you do it because your appetite was so small,&#10;or did you wish to count the grains so that you might never eat&#10;more than a certain number? If it was from economy, and you are&#10;anxious to teach me not to be wasteful, you have no cause for&#10;alarm. We shall never ruin ourselves in that way! Our fortune is&#10;large enough for all our needs, therefore, dear Amina, do not seek&#10;to check yourself, but eat as much as you desire, as I do!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In reply to my affectionate words, I expected a cheerful answer;&#10;yet Amina said nothing at all, but continued to pick her rice as&#10;before, only at longer and longer intervals. And, instead of trying&#10;the other dishes, all she did was to put every now and then a&#10;crumb, of bread into her mouth, that would not have made a meal for&#10;a sparrow.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I felt provoked by her obstinacy, but to excuse her to myself as&#10;far as I could, I suggested that perhaps she had never been used to&#10;eat in the company of men, and that her family might have taught&#10;her that she ought to behave prudently and discreetly in the&#10;presence of her husband. Likewise that she might either have dined&#10;already or intend to do so in her own apartments. So I took no&#10;further notice, and when I had finished left the room, secretly&#10;much vexed at her strange conduct.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The same thing occurred at supper, and all through the next day,&#10;whenever we ate together. It was quite clear that no woman could&#10;live upon two or three bread-crumbs and a few grains of rice, and I&#10;determined to find out how and when she got food. I pretended not&#10;to pay attention to anything she did, in the hope that little by&#10;little she would get accustomed to me, and become more friendly;&#10;but I soon saw that my expectations were quite vain.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;One night I was lying with my eyes closed, and to, all&#10;appearance sound asleep, when Amina arose softly, and dressed&#10;herself without making the slightest sound. I could not imagine&#10;what she was going to do, and as my curiosity was great I made up&#10;my mind to follow her. When she was fully dressed, she stole&#10;quietly from the room.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The instant she had let the curtain fall behind her, I flung a&#10;garment on my shoulders and a pair of slippers on my feet. Looking&#10;from a lattice which opened into the court, I saw her in the act of&#10;passing through the street door, which she carefully left open.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was bright moonlight, so I easily managed to keep her in&#10;sight, till she entered a cemetery not far from the house. There I&#10;hid myself under the shadow of the wall, and crouched down&#10;cautiously; and hardly was I concealed, when I saw my wife&#10;approaching in company with a ghoul&#8212;one of those demons which, as&#10;your Highness is aware, wander about the country making their lairs&#10;in deserted buildings and springing out upon unwary travellers&#10;whose flesh they eat. If no live being goes their way, they then&#10;betake themselves to the cemeteries, and feed upon the dead&#10;bodies.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I was nearly struck dumb with horror on seeing my wife with this&#10;hideous female ghoul. They passed by me without noticing me, began&#10;to dig up a corpse which had been buried that day, and then sat&#10;down on the edge of the grave, to enjoy their frightful repast,&#10;talking quietly and cheerfully all the while, though I was too far&#10;off to hear what they said. When they had finished, they threw back&#10;the body into the grave, and heaped back the earth upon it. I made&#10;no effort to disturb them, and returned quickly to the house, when&#10;I took care to leave the door open, as I had previously found it.&#10;Then I got back into bed, and pretended to sleep soundly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A short time after Amina entered as quietly as she had gone out.&#10;She undressed and stole into bed, congratulating herself apparently&#10;on the cleverness with which she had managed her expedition.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As may be guessed, after such a scene it was long before I could&#10;close my eyes, and at the first sound which called the faithful to&#10;prayer, I put on my clothes and went to the mosque. But even prayer&#10;did not restore peace to my troubled spirit, and I could not face&#10;my wife until I had made up my mind what future course I should&#10;pursue in regard to her. I therefore spent the morning roaming&#10;about from one garden to another, turning over various plans for&#10;compelling my wife to give up her horrible ways; I thought of using&#10;violence to make her submit, but felt reluctant to be unkind to&#10;her. Besides, I had an instinct that gentle means had the best&#10;chance of success; so, a little soothed, I turned towards home,&#10;which I reached about the hour of dinner.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As soon as I appeared, Amina ordered dinner to be served, and we&#10;sat down together. As usual, she persisted in only picking a few&#10;grains of rice, and I resolved to speak to her at once of what lay&#10;so heavily on my heart.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Amina,&#34; I said, as quietly as possible, &#34;you must have guessed&#10;the surprise I felt, when the day after our marriage you declined&#10;to eat anything but a few morsels of rice, and altogether behaved&#10;in such a manner that most husbands would have been deeply wounded.&#10;However I had patience with you, and only tried to tempt your&#10;appetite by the choicest dishes I could invent, but all to no&#10;purpose. Still, Amina, it seems to me that there be some among them&#10;as sweet to the taste as the flesh of a corpse?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I had no sooner uttered these words than Amina, who instantly&#10;understood that I had followed her to the grave-yard, was seized&#10;with a passion beyond any that I have ever witnessed. Her face&#10;became purple, her eyes looked as if they would start from her&#10;head, and she positively foamed with rage.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I watched her with terror, wondering what would happen next, but&#10;little thinking what would be the end of her fury. She seized a&#10;vessel of water that stood at hand, and plunging her hand in it,&#10;murmured some words I failed to catch. Then, sprinkling it on my&#10;face, she cried madly:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Wretch, receive the reward of your prying, and become a&#10;dog.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The words were not out of her mouth when, without feeling&#10;conscious that any change was passing over me, I suddenly knew that&#10;I had ceased to be a man. In the greatness of the shock and&#10;surprise&#8212;for I had no idea that Amina was a magician&#8212;I never&#10;dreamed of running away, and stood rooted to the spot, while Amina&#10;grasped a stick and began to beat me. Indeed her blows were so&#10;heavy, that I only wonder they did not kill me at once. However&#10;they succeeded in rousing me from my stupor, and I dashed into the&#10;court-yard, followed closely by Amina, who made frantic dives at&#10;me, which I was not quick enough to dodge. At last she got tired of&#10;pursuing me, or else a new trick entered into her head, which would&#10;give me speedy and painful death; she opened the gate leading into&#10;the street, intending to crush me as I passed through. Dog though I&#10;was, I saw through her design, and stung into presence of mind by&#10;the greatness of the danger, I timed my movements so well that I&#10;contrived to rush through, and only the tip of my tail received a&#10;squeeze as she banged the gate.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I was safe, but my tail hurt me horribly, and I yelped and&#10;howled so loud all along the streets, that the other dogs came and&#10;attacked me, which made matters no better. In order to avoid them,&#10;I took refuge in a cookshop, where tongues and sheep&#39;s heads were&#10;sold.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At first the owner showed me great kindness, and drove away the&#10;other dogs that were still at my heels, while I crept into the&#10;darkest corner. But though I was safe for the moment, I was not&#10;destined to remain long under his protection, for he was one of&#10;those who hold all dogs to be unclean, and that all the washing in&#10;the world will hardly purify you from their contact. So after my&#10;enemies had gone to seek other prey, he tried to lure me from my&#10;corner in order to force me into the street. But I refused to come&#10;out of my hole, and spent the night in sleep, which I sorely&#10;needed, after the pain inflicted on me by Amina.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I have no wish to weary your Highness by dwelling on the sad&#10;thoughts which accompanied my change of shape, but it may interest&#10;you to hear that the next morning my host went out early to do his&#10;marketing, and returned laden with the sheep&#39;s heads, and tongues&#10;and trotters that formed his stock in trade for the day. The smell&#10;of meat attracted various hungry dogs in the neighbourhood, and&#10;they gathered round the door begging for some bits. I stole out of&#10;my corner, and stood with them.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In spite of his objection to dogs, as unclean animals, my&#10;protector was a kind-hearted man, and knowing I had eaten nothing&#10;since yesterday, he threw me bigger and better bits than those&#10;which fell to the share of the other dogs. When I had finished, I&#10;tried to go back into the shop, but this he would not allow, and&#10;stood so firmly at the entrance with a stout stick, that I was&#10;forced to give it up, and seek some other home.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A few paces further on was a baker&#39;s shop, which seemed to have&#10;a gay and merry man for a master. At that moment he was having his&#10;breakfast, and though I gave no signs of hunger, he at once threw&#10;me a piece of bread. Before gobbling it up, as most dogs are in the&#10;habit of doing, I bowed my head and wagged my tail, in token of&#10;thanks, and he understood, and smiled pleasantly. I really did not&#10;want the bread at all, but felt it would be ungracious to refuse,&#10;so I ate it slowly, in order that he might see that I only did it&#10;out of politeness. He understood this also, and seemed quite&#10;willing to let me stay in his shop, so I sat down, with my face to&#10;the door, to show that I only asked his protection. This he gave&#10;me, and indeed encouraged me to come into the house itself, giving&#10;me a corner where I might sleep, without being in anybody&#39;s&#10;way.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The kindness heaped on me by this excellent man was far greater&#10;than I could ever have expected. He was always affectionate in his&#10;manner of treating me, and I shared his breakfast, dinner and&#10;supper, while, on my side, I gave him all the gratitude and&#10;attachment to which he had a right.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;I sat with my eyes fixed on him, and he never left the house&#10;without having me at his heels; and if it ever happened that when&#10;he was preparing to go out I was asleep, and did not notice, he&#10;would call &#34;Rufus, Rufus,&#34; for that was the name he gave me.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Some weeks passed in this way, when one day a woman came in to&#10;buy bread. In paying for it, she laid down several pieces of money,&#10;one of which was bad. The baker perceived this, and declined to&#10;take it, demanding another in its place. The woman, for her part,&#10;refused to take it back, declaring it was perfectly good, but the&#10;baker would have nothing to do with it. &#34;It is really such a bad&#10;imitation,&#34; he exclaimed at last, &#34;that even my dog would not be&#10;taken in. Here Rufus! Rufus!&#34; and hearing his voice, I jumped on to&#10;the counter. The baker threw down the money before me, and said,&#10;&#34;Find out if there is a bad coin.&#34; I looked at each in turn, and&#10;then laid my paw on the false one, glancing at the same time at my&#10;master, so as to point it out.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The baker, who had of course been only in joke, was exceedingly&#10;surprised at my cleverness, and the woman, who was at last&#10;convinced that the man spoke the truth, produced another piece of&#10;money in its place. When she had gone, my master was so pleased&#10;that he told all the neighbours what I had done, and made a great&#10;deal more of it than there really was.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The neighbours, very naturally, declined to believe his story,&#10;and tried me several times with all the bad money they could&#10;collect together, but I never failed to stand the test&#10;triumphantly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Soon, the shop was filled from morning till night, with people&#10;who on the pretence of buying bread came to see if I was as clever&#10;as I was reported to be. The baker drove a roaring trade, and&#10;admitted that I was worth my weight in gold to him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Of course there were plenty who envied him his large custom, and&#10;many was the pitfall set for me, so that he never dared to let me&#10;out of his sight. One day a woman, who had not been in the shop&#10;before, came to ask for bread, like the rest. As usual, I was lying&#10;on the counter, and she threw down six coins before me, one of&#10;which was false. I detected it at once, and put my paw on it,&#10;looking as I did so at the woman. &#34;Yes,&#34; she said, nodding her&#10;head. &#34;You are quite right, that is the one.&#34; She stood gazing at&#10;me attentively for some time, then paid for the bread, and left the&#10;shop, making a sign for me to follow her secretly.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now my thoughts were always running on some means of shaking off&#10;the spell laid on me, and noticing the way in which this woman had&#10;looked at me, the idea entered my head that perhaps she might have&#10;guessed what had happened, and in this I was not deceived. However&#10;I let her go on a little way, and merely stood at the door watching&#10;her. She turned, and seeing that I was quite still, she again&#10;beckoned to me.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The baker all this while was busy with his oven, and had&#10;forgotten all about me, so I stole out softly, and ran after the&#10;woman.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When we came to her house, which was some distance off, she&#10;opened the door and then said to me, &#34;Come in, come in; you will&#10;never be sorry that you followed me.&#34; When I had entered she&#10;fastened the door, and took me into a large room, where a beautiful&#10;girl was working at a piece of embroidery. &#34;My daughter,&#34; exclaimed&#10;my guide, &#34;I have brought you the famous dog belonging to the baker&#10;which can tell good money from bad. You know that when I first&#10;heard of him, I told you I was sure he must be really a man,&#10;changed into a dog by magic. To-day I went to the baker&#39;s, to prove&#10;for myself the truth of the story, and persuaded the dog to follow&#10;me here. Now what do you say?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You are right, mother,&#34; replied the girl, and rising she dipped&#10;her hand into a vessel of water. Then sprinkling it over me she&#10;said, &#34;If you were born dog, remain dog; but if you were born man,&#10;by virtue of this water resume your proper form.&#34; In one moment the&#10;spell was broken. The dog&#39;s shape vanished as if it had never been,&#10;and it was a man who stood before her.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Overcome with gratitude at my deliverance, I flung myself at her&#10;feet, and kissed the hem of her garment. &#34;How can I thank you for&#10;your goodness towards a stranger, and for what you have done?&#10;Henceforth I am your slave. Deal with me as you will!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then, in order to explain how I came to be changed into a dog, I&#10;told her my whole story, and finished with rendering the mother the&#10;thanks due to her for the happiness she had brought me.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Sidi-Nouman,&#34; returned the daughter, &#34;say no more about the&#10;obligation you are under to us. The knowledge that we have been of&#10;service to you is ample payment. Let us speak of Amina, your wife,&#10;with whom I was acquainted before her marriage. I was aware that&#10;she was a magician, and she knew too that I had studied the same&#10;art, under the same mistress. We met often going to the same baths,&#10;but we did not like each other, and never sought to become friends.&#10;As to what concerns you, it is not enough to have broken your&#10;spell, she must be punished for her wickedness. Remain for a moment&#10;with my mother, I beg,&#34; she added hastily, &#34;I will return&#10;shortly.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Left alone with the mother, I again expressed the gratitude I&#10;felt, to her as well as to her daughter.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My daughter,&#34; she answered, &#34;is, as you see, as accomplished a&#10;magician as Amina herself, but you would be astonished at the&#10;amount of good she does by her knowledge. That is why I have never&#10;interfered, otherwise I should have put a stop to it long ago.&#34; As&#10;she spoke, her daughter entered with a small bottle in her&#10;hand.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Sidi-Nouman,&#34; she said, &#34;the books I have just consulted tell&#10;me that Amina is not home at present, but she should return at any&#10;moment. I have likewise found out by their means, that she pretends&#10;before the servants great uneasiness as to your absence. She has&#10;circulated a story that, while at dinner with her, you remembered&#10;some important business that had to be done at once, and left the&#10;house without shutting the door. By this means a dog had strayed&#10;in, which she was forced to get rid of by a stick. Go home then&#10;without delay, and await Amina&#39;s return in your room. When she&#10;comes in, go down to meet her, and in her surprise, she will try to&#10;run away. Then have this bottle ready, and dash the water it&#10;contains over her, saying boldly, &#34;Receive the reward of your&#10;crimes.&#34; That is all I have to tell you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Everything happened exactly as the young magician had foretold.&#10;I had not been in my house many minutes before Amina returned, and&#10;as she approached I stepped in front of her, with the water in my&#10;hand. She gave one loud cry, and turned to the door, but she was&#10;too late. I had already dashed the water in her face and spoken the&#10;magic words. Amina disappeared, and in her place stood the horse&#10;you saw me beating yesterday.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;This, Commander of the Faithful, is my story, and may I venture&#10;to hope that, now you have heard the reason of my conduct, your&#10;Highness will not think this wicked woman too harshly treated?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Sidi-Nouman,&#34; replied the Caliph, &#34;your story is indeed a&#10;strange one, and there is no excuse to be offered for your wife.&#10;But, without condemning your treatment of her, I wish you to&#10;reflect how much she must suffer from being changed into an animal,&#10;and I hope you will let that punishment be enough. I do not order&#10;you to insist upon the young magician finding the means to restore&#10;your wife to her human shape, because I know that when once women&#10;such as she begin to work evil they never leave off, and I should&#10;only bring down on your head a vengeance far worse than the one you&#10;have undergone already.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 3, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/208', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('Story of Ali Colia, Merchant of&#10;Bagdad'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;In the reign of Haroun-al-Raschid, there lived in Bagdad a&#10;merchant named Ali Cogia, who, having neither wife nor child,&#10;contented himself with the modest profits produced by his trade. He&#10;had spent some years quite happily in the house his father had left&#10;him, when three nights running he dreamed that an old man had&#10;appeared to him, and reproached him for having neglected the duty&#10;of a good Mussulman, in delaying so long his pilgrimage to&#10;Mecca.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Ali Cogia was much troubled by this dream, as he was unwilling&#10;to give up his shop, and lose all his customers. He had shut his&#10;eyes for some time to the necessity of performing this pilgrimage,&#10;and tried to atone to his conscience by an extra number of good&#10;works, but the dream seemed to him a direct warning, and he&#10;resolved to put the journey off no longer.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The first thing he did was to sell his furniture and the wares&#10;he had in his shop, only reserving to himself such goods as he&#10;might trade with on the road. The shop itself he sold also, and&#10;easily found a tenant for his private house. The only matter he&#10;could not settle satisfactorily was the safe custody of a thousand&#10;pieces of gold which he wished to leave behind him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;After some thought, Ali Cogia hit upon a plan which seemed a&#10;safe one. He took a large vase, and placing the money in the bottom&#10;of it, filled up the rest with olives. After corking the vase&#10;tightly down, he carried it to one of his friends, a merchant like&#10;himself, and said to him:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My brother, you have probably heard that I am staffing with a&#10;caravan in a few days for Mecca. I have come to ask whether you&#10;would do me the favour to keep this vase of olives for me till I&#10;come back?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The merchant replied readily, &#34;Look, this is the key of my shop:&#10;take it, and put the vase wherever you like. I promise that you&#10;shall find it in the same place on your return.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A few days later, Ali Cogia mounted the camel that he had laden&#10;with merchandise, joined the caravan, and arrived in due time at&#10;Mecca. Like the other pilgrims he visited the sacred Mosque, and&#10;after all his religious duties were performed, he set out his goods&#10;to the best advantage, hoping to gain some customers among the&#10;passers-by.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Very soon two merchants stopped before the pile, and when they&#10;had turned it over, one said to the other:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;If this man was wise he would take these things to Cairo, where&#10;he would get a much better price than he is likely to do here.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Ali Cogia heard the words, and lost no time in following the&#10;advice. He packed up his wares, and instead of returning to Bagdad,&#10;joined a caravan that was going to Cairo. The results of the&#10;journey gladdened his heart. He sold off everything almost&#10;directly, and bought a stock of Egyptian curiosities, which he&#10;intended selling at Damascus; but as the caravan with which he&#10;would have to travel would not be starting for another six weeks,&#10;he took advantage of the delay to visit the Pyramids, and some of&#10;the cities along the banks of the Nile.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now the attractions of Damascus so fascinated the worthy Ali,&#10;that he could hardly tear himself away, but at length he remembered&#10;that he had a home in Bagdad, meaning to return by way of Aleppo,&#10;and after he had crossed the Euphrates, to follow the course of the&#10;Tigris.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But when he reached Mossoul, Ali had made such friends with some&#10;Persian merchants, that they persuaded him to accompany them to&#10;their native land, and even as far as India, and so it came to pass&#10;that seven years had slipped by since he had left Bagdad, and&#10;during all that time the friend with whom he had left the vase of&#10;olives had never once thought of him or of it. In fact, it was only&#10;a month before Ali Cogia&#39;s actual return that the affair came into&#10;his head at all, owing to his wife&#39;s remarking one day, that it was&#10;a long time since she had eaten any olives, and would like&#10;some.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That reminds me,&#34; said the husband, &#34;that before Ali Cogia went&#10;to Mecca seven years ago, he left a vase of olives in my care. But&#10;really by this time he must be dead, and there is no reason we&#10;should not eat the olives if we like. Give me a light, and I will&#10;fetch them and see how they taste.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My husband,&#34; answered the wife, &#34;beware, I pray, of your doing&#10;anything so base! Supposing seven years have passed without news of&#10;Ali Cogia, he need not be dead for all that, and may come back any&#10;day. How shameful it would be to have to confess that you had&#10;betrayed your trust and broken the seal of the vase! Pay no&#10;attention to my idle words, I really have no desire for olives now.&#10;And probably after all this while they are no longer good. I have a&#10;presentiment that Ali Cogia will return, and what will he think of&#10;you? Give it up, I entreat.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The merchant, however, refused to listen to her advice, sensible&#10;though it was. He took a light and a dish and went into his&#10;shop.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;If you will be so obstinate,&#34; said his wife, &#34;I cannot help it;&#10;but do not blame me if it turns out ill.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When the merchant opened the vase he found the topmost olives&#10;were rotten, and in order to see if the under ones were in better&#10;condition he shook some ont into the dish. As they fell out a few&#10;of the gold pieces fell out too.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The sight of the money roused all the merchant&#39;s greed. He&#10;looked into the vase, and saw that all the bottom was filled with&#10;gold. He then replaced the olives and returned to his wife.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My wife,&#34; he said, as he entered the room, &#34;you were quite&#10;right; the olives are rotten, and I have recorked the vase so well&#10;that Ali Cogia will never know it has been touched.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You would have done better to believe me,&#34; replied the wife. &#34;I&#10;trust that no harm will come of it.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;These words made no more impression on the merchant than the&#10;others had done; and he spent the whole night in wondering how he&#10;could manage to keep the gold if Ali Cogia should come back and&#10;claim his vase. Very early next morning he went out and bought&#10;fresh new olives; he then threw away the old ones, took out the&#10;gold and hid it, and filled up the vase with the olives he had&#10;bought. This done he recorked the vase and put it in the same place&#10;where it had been left by Ali Cogia.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A month later Ali Cogia re-entered Bagdad, and as his house was&#10;still let he went to an inn; and the following day set out to see&#10;his friend the merchant, who received him with open arms and many&#10;expressions of surprise. After a few moments given to inquiries Ali&#10;Cogia begged the merchant to hand him over the vase that he had&#10;taken care of for so long.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh certainly,&#34; said he, &#34;I am only glad I could be of use to&#10;you in the matter. Here is the key of my shop; you will find the&#10;vase in the place where you put it.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Ali Cogia fetched his vase and carried it to his room at the&#10;inn, where he opened it. He thrust down his hand but could feel no&#10;money, but still was persuaded it must be there. So he got some&#10;plates and vessels from his travelling kit and emptied ont the&#10;olives. To no purpose. The gold was not there. The poor man was&#10;dumb with horror, then, lifting up his hands, he exclaimed, &#34;Can my&#10;old friend really have committed such a crime?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In great haste he went back to the house of the merchant. &#34;My&#10;friend,&#34; he cried, &#34;you will be astonished to see me again, but I&#10;can find nowhere in this vase a thousand pieces of gold that I&#10;placed in the bottom under the olives. Perhaps you may have taken a&#10;loan of them for your business purposes; if that is so you are most&#10;welcome. I will only ask you to give me a receipt, and you can pay&#10;the money at your leisure.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The merchant, who had expected something of the sort, had his&#10;reply all ready. &#34;Ali Cogia,&#34; he said, &#34;when you brought me the&#10;vase of olives did I ever touch it?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I gave you the key of my shop and you put it yourself where you&#10;liked, and did you not find it in exactly the same spot and in the&#10;same state? If you placed any gold in it, it must be there still. I&#10;know nothing about that; you only told me there were olives. You&#10;can believe me or not, but I have not laid a finger on the&#10;vase.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Ali Cogia still tried every means to persuade the merchant to&#10;admit the truth. &#34;I love peace,&#34; he said, &#34;and shall deeply regret&#10;having to resort to harsh measures. Once more, think of your&#10;reputation. I shall be in despair if you oblige me to call in the&#10;aid of the law.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ali Cogia,&#34; answered the merchant, &#34;you allow that it was a&#10;vase of olives you placed in my charge. You fetched it and removed&#10;it yourself, and now you tell me it contained a thousand pieces of&#10;gold, and that I must restore them to you! Did you ever say&#10;anything about them before? Why, I did not even know that the vase&#10;had olives in it! Yon never showed them to me. I wonder you have&#10;not demanded pearls or diamonds. Retire, I pray you, lest a crowd&#10;should gather in front of my shop.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;By this time not only the casual passers-by, but also the&#10;neighbouring merchants, were standing round, listening to the&#10;dispute, and trying every now and then to smooth matters between&#10;them. But at the merchant&#39;s last words Ali Cogia resolved to lay&#10;the cause of the quarrel before them, and told them the whole&#10;story. They heard him to the end, and inquired of the merchant what&#10;he had to say.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The accused man admitted that he had kept Ali Cogia&#39;s vase in&#10;his shop; but he denied having touched it, and swore that as to&#10;what it contained he only knew what Ali Cogia had told him, and&#10;called them all to witness the insult that had been put upon&#10;him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You have brought it on yourself,&#34; said Ali Cogia, taking him by&#10;the arm, &#34;and as you appeal to the law, the law you shall have! Let&#10;us see if you will dare to repeat your story before the Cadi.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now as a good Mussulman the merchant was forbidden to refuse&#10;this choice of a judge, so he accepted the test, and said to Ali&#10;Cogia, &#34;Very well; I should like nothing better. We shall soon see&#10;which of us is in the right.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So the two men presented themselves before the Cadi, and Ali&#10;Cogia again repeated his tale. The Cadi asked what witnesses he&#10;had. Ali Cogia replied that he had not taken this precaution, as he&#10;had considered the man his friend, and up to that time had always&#10;found him honest.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The merchant, on his side, stuck to his story, and offered to&#10;swear solemnly that not only had he never stolen the thousand gold&#10;pieces, but that he did not even know they were there. The Cadi&#10;allowed him to take the oath, and pronounced him innocent.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Ali Cogia, furious at having to suffer such a loss, protested&#10;against the verdict, declaring that he would appeal to the Caliph,&#10;Haroun-al-Raschid, himself. But the Cadi paid no attention to his&#10;threats, and was quite satisfied that he had done what was&#10;right.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Judgment being given the merchant returned home triumphant, and&#10;Ali Cogia went back to his inn to draw up a petition to the Caliph.&#10;The next morning he placed himself on the road along which the&#10;Caliph must pass after mid-day prayer, and stretched out his&#10;petition to the officer who walked before the Caliph, whose duty it&#10;was to collect such things, and on entering the palace to hand them&#10;to his master. There Haroun-al-Raschid studied them carefully.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Knowing this custom, Ali Cogia followed the Caliph into the&#10;public hall of the palace, and waited the result. After some time&#10;the officer appeared, and told him that the Caliph had read his&#10;petition, and had appointed an hour the next morning to give him&#10;audience. He then inquired the merchant&#39;s address, so that he might&#10;be summoned to attend also.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;That very evening, the Caliph, with his grand-vizir Giafar, and&#10;Mesrour, chief of the eunuchs, all three disguised, as was their&#10;habit, went out to take a stroll through the town.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Going down one street, the Caliph&#39;s attention was attracted by a&#10;noise, and looking through a door which opened into a court he&#10;perceived ten or twelve children playing in the moonlight. He hid&#10;himself in a dark corner, and watched them.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Let us play at being the Cadi,&#34; said the brightest and quickest&#10;of them all; &#34;I will be the Cadi. Bring before me Ali Cogia, and&#10;the merchant who robbed him of the thousand pieces of gold.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The boy&#39;s words recalled to the Caliph the petition he had read&#10;that morning, and he waited with interest to see what the children&#10;would do.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The proposal was hailed with joy by the other children, who had&#10;heard a great deal of talk about the matter, and they quickly&#10;settled the part each one was to play. The Cadi took his seat&#10;gravely, and an officer introduced first Ali Cogia, the plaintiff,&#10;and then the merchant who was the defendant.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Ali Cogia made a low bow, and pleaded his cause point by point;&#10;concluding by imploring the Cadi not to inflict on him such a heavy&#10;loss.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Cadi having heard his case, turned to the merchant, and&#10;inquired why he had not repaid Ali Cogia the sum in question.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The false merchant repeated the reasons that the real merchant&#10;had given to the Cadi of Bagdad, and also offered to swear that he&#10;had told the truth.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Stop a moment!&#34; said the little Cadi, &#34;before we come to oaths,&#10;I should like to examine the vase with the olives. Ali Cogia,&#34; he&#10;added, &#34;have you got the vase with you?&#34; and finding he had not,&#10;the Cadi continued, &#34;Go and get it, and bring it to me.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So Ali Cogia disappeared for an instant, and then pretended to&#10;lay a vase at the feet of the Cadi, declaring it was his vase,&#10;which he had given to the accused for safe custody; and in order to&#10;be quite correct, the Cadi asked the merchant if he recognised it&#10;as the same vase. By his silence the merchant admitted the fact,&#10;and the Cadi then commanded to have the vase opened. Ali Cogia made&#10;a movement as if he was taking off the lid, and the little Cadi on&#10;his part made a pretence of peering into a vase.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What beautiful olives!&#34; he said, &#34;I should like to taste one,&#34;&#10;and pretending to put one in his mouth, he added, &#34;they are really&#10;excellent!&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But,&#34; he went on, &#34;it seems to me odd that olives seven years&#10;old should be as good as that! Send for some dealers in olives, and&#10;let us hear what they say!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Two children were presented to him as olive merchants, and the&#10;Cadi addressed them. &#34;Tell me,&#34; he said, &#34;how long can olives be&#10;kept so as to be pleasant eating?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My lord,&#34; replied the merchants, &#34;however much care is taken to&#10;preserve them, they never last beyond the third year. They lose&#10;both taste and colour, and are only fit to be thrown away.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;If that is so,&#34; answered the little Cadi, &#34;examine this vase,&#10;and tell me how long the olives have been in it.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The olive merchants pretended to examine the olives and taste&#10;them; then reported to the Cadi that they were fresh and good.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You are mistaken,&#34; said he, &#34;Ali Cogia declares he put them in&#10;that vase seven years ago.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My lord,&#34; returned the olive merchants, &#34;we can assure you that&#10;the olives are those of the present year. And if you consult all&#10;the merchants in Bagdad you will not find one to give a contrary&#10;opinion.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The accused merchant opened his mouth as if to protest, but the&#10;Cadi gave him no time. &#34;Be silent,&#34; he said, &#34;you are a thief. Take&#10;him away and hang him.&#34; So the game ended, the children clapping&#10;their hands in applause, and leading the criminal away to be&#10;hanged.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Haroun-al-Raschid was lost in astonishment at the wisdom of the&#10;child, who had given so wise a verdict on the case which he himself&#10;was to hear on the morrow. &#34;Is there any other verdict possible?&#34;&#10;he asked the grand-vizir, who was as much impressed as himself. &#34;I&#10;can imagine no better judgment.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;If the circumstances are really such as we have heard,&#34; replied&#10;the grand-vizir, &#34;it seems to me your Highness could only follow&#10;the example of this boy, in the method of reasoning, and also in&#10;your conclusions.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Then take careful note of this house,&#34; said the Caliph, &#34;and&#10;bring me the boy to-morrow, so that the affair may be tried by him&#10;in my presence. Summon also the Cadi, to learn his duty from the&#10;mouth of a child. Bid Ali Cogia bring his vase of olives, and see&#10;that two dealers in olives are present.&#34; So saying the Caliph&#10;returned to the palace.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The next morning early, the grand-vizir went back to the house&#10;where they had seen the children playing, and asked for the&#10;mistress and her children. Three boys appeared, and the grand-vizir&#10;inquired which had represented the Cadi in their game of the&#10;previous evening. The eldest and tallest, changing colour,&#10;confessed that it was he, and to his mother&#39;s great alarm, the&#10;grand-vizir said that he had strict orders to bring him into the&#10;presence of the Caliph.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Does he want to take my son from me?&#34; cried the poor woman; but&#10;the grand-vizir hastened to calm her, by assuring her that she&#10;should have the boy again in an hour, and she would be quite&#10;satisfied when she knew the reason of the summons. So she dressed&#10;the boy in his best clothes, and the two left the house.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When the grand-vizir presented the child to the Caliph, he was a&#10;little awed and confused, and the Caliph proceeded to explain why&#10;he had sent for him. &#34;Approach, my son,&#34; he said kindly. &#34;I think&#10;it was you who judged the case of Ali Cogia and the merchant last&#10;night? I overheard you by chance, and was very pleased with the way&#10;you conducted it. To-day you will see the real Ali Cogia and the&#10;real merchant. Seat yourself at once next to me.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Caliph being seated on his throne with the boy next him, the&#10;parties to the suit were ushered in. One by one they prostrated&#10;themselves, and touched the carpet at the foot of the throne with&#10;their foreheads. When they rose up, the Caliph said: &#34;Now speak.&#10;This child will give you justice, and if more should be wanted I&#10;will see to it myself.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Ali Cogia and the merchant pleaded one after the other, but when&#10;the merchant offered to swear the same oath that he had taken&#10;before the Cadi, he was stopped by the child, who said that before&#10;this was done he must first see the vase of olives.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At these words, Ali Cogia presented the vase to the Caliph, and&#10;uncovered it. The Caliph took one of the olives, tasted it, and&#10;ordered the expert merchants to do the same. They pronounced the&#10;olives good, and fresh that year. The boy informed them that Ali&#10;Cogia declared it was seven years since he had placed them in the&#10;vase; to which they returned the same answer as the children had&#10;done.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The accused merchant saw by this time that his condemnation was&#10;certain, and tried to allege something in his defence. The boy had&#10;too much sense to order him to be hanged, and looked at the Caliph,&#10;saying, &#34;Commander of the Faithful, this is not a game now; it is&#10;for your Highness to condemn him to death and not for me.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then the Caliph, convinced that the man was a thief, bade them&#10;take him away and hang him, which was done, but not before he had&#10;confessed his guilt and the place in which he had hidden Ali&#10;Cogia&#39;s money. The Caliph ordered the Cadi to learn how to deal out&#10;justice from the mouth of a child, and sent the boy home, with a&#10;purse containing a hundred pieces of gold as a mark of his&#10;favour.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 3, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/208', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('The Enchanted Horse'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was the Feast of the New Year, the oldest and most splendid&#10;of all the feasts in the Kingdom of Persia, and the day had been&#10;spent by the king in the city of Schiraz, taking part in the&#10;magnificent spectacles prepared by his subjects to do honour to the&#10;festival. The sun was setting, and the monarch was about to give&#10;his court the signal to retire, when suddenly an Indian appeared&#10;before his throne, leading a horse richly harnessed, and looking in&#10;every respect exactly like a real one.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Sire,&#34; said he, prostrating himself as he spoke, &#34;although I&#10;make my appearance so late before your Highness, I can confidently&#10;assure you that none of the wonders you have seen during the day&#10;can be compared to this horse, if you will deign to cast your eyes&#10;upon him.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I see nothing in it,&#34; replied the king, &#34;except a clever&#10;imitation of a real one; and any skilled workman might do as&#10;much.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Sire,&#34; returned the Indian, &#34;it is not of his outward form that&#10;I would speak, but of the use that I can make of him. I have only&#10;to mount him, and to wish myself in some special place, and no&#10;matter how distant it may be, in a very few moments I shall find&#10;myself there. It is this, Sire, that makes the horse so marvellous,&#10;and if your Highness will allow me, you can prove it for&#10;yourself.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The King of Persia, who was interested in every thing out of the&#10;common, and had never before come across a horse with such&#10;qualities, bade the Indian mount the animal, and show what he could&#10;do. In an instant the man had vaulted on his back, and inquired&#10;where the monarch wished to send him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Do you see that mountain?&#34; asked the king, pointing to a huge&#10;mass that towered into the sky about three leagues from Schiraz;&#10;&#34;go and bring me the leaf of a palm that grows at the foot.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The words were hardly out of the king&#39;s mouth when the Indian&#10;turned a screw placed in the horse&#39;s neck, close to the saddle, and&#10;the animal bounded like lightning up into the air, and was soon&#10;beyond the sight even of the sharpest eyes. In a quarter of an hour&#10;the Indian was seen returning, bearing in his hand the palm, and,&#10;guiding his horse to the foot of the throne, he dismounted, and&#10;laid the leaf before the king.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now the monarch had no sooner proved the astonishing speed of&#10;which the horse was capable than he longed to possess it himself,&#10;and indeed, so sure was he that the Indian would be quite ready to&#10;sell it, that he looked upon it as his own already.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I never guessed from his mere outside how valuable an animal he&#10;was,&#34; he remarked to the Indian, &#34;and I am grateful to you for&#10;having shown me my error,&#34; said he. &#34;If you will sell it, name your&#10;own price.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Sire,&#34; replied the Indian, &#34;I never doubted that a sovereign so&#10;wise and accomplished as your Highness would do justice to my&#10;horse, when he once knew its power; and I even went so far as to&#10;think it probable that you might wish to possess it. Greatly as I&#10;prize it, I will yield it up to your Highness on one condition. The&#10;horse was not constructed by me, but it was given me by the&#10;inventor, in exchange for my only daughter, who made me take a&#10;solemn oath that I would never part with it, except for some object&#10;of equal value.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Name anything you like,&#34; cried the monarch, interrupting him.&#10;&#34;My kingdom is large, and filled with fair cities. You have only to&#10;choose which you would prefer, to become its ruler to the end of&#10;your life.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Sire,&#34; answered the Indian, to whom the proposal did not seem&#10;nearly so generous as it appeared to the king, &#34;I am most grateful&#10;to your Highness for your princely offer, and beseech you not to be&#10;offended with me if I say that I can only deliver up my horse in&#10;exchange for the hand of the princess your daughter.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A shout of laughter burst from the courtiers as they heard these&#10;words, and Prince Firouz Schah, the heir apparent, was filled with&#10;anger at the Indian&#39;s presumption. The king, however, thought that&#10;it would not cost him much to part from the princess in order to&#10;gain such a delightful toy, and while he was hesitating as to his&#10;answer the prince broke in.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Sire,&#34; he said, &#34;it is not possible that you can doubt for an&#10;instant what reply you should give to such an insolent bargain.&#10;Consider what you owe to yourself, and to the blood of your&#10;ancestors.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My son,&#34; replied the king, &#34;you speak nobly, but you do not&#10;realise either the value of the horse, or the fact that if I reject&#10;the proposal of the Indian, he will only make the same to some&#10;other monarch, and I should be filled with despair at the thought&#10;that anyone but myself should own this Seventh Wonder of the World.&#10;Of course I do not say that I shall accept his conditions, and&#10;perhaps he may be brought to reason, but meanwhile I should like&#10;you to examine the horse, and, with the owner&#39;s permission, to make&#10;trial of its powers.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Indian, who had overheard the king&#39;s speech, thought that he&#10;saw in it signs of yielding to his proposal, so he joyfully agreed&#10;to the monarch&#39;s wishes, and came forward to help the prince to&#10;mount the horse, and show him how to guide it: but, before he had&#10;finished, the young man turned the screw, and was soon out of&#10;sight.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;They waited some time, expecting that every moment he might be&#10;seen returning in the distance, but at length the Indian grew&#10;frightened, and prostrating himself before the throne, he said to&#10;the king, &#34;Sire, your Highness must have noticed that the prince,&#10;in his impatience, did not allow me to tell him what it was&#10;necessary to do in order to return to the place from which he&#10;started. I implore you not to punish me for what was not my fault,&#10;and not to visit on me any misfortune that may occur.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But why,&#34; cried the king in a burst of fear and anger, &#34;why did&#10;you not call him back when you saw him disappearing?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Sire,&#34; replied the Indian, &#34;the rapidity of his movements took&#10;me so by surprise that he was out of hearing before I recovered my&#10;speech. But we must hope that he will perceive and turn a second&#10;screw, which will have the effect of bringing the horse back to&#10;earth.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But supposing he does!&#34; answered the king, &#34;what is to hinder&#10;the horse from descending straight into the sea, or dashing him to&#10;pieces on the rocks?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Have no fears, your Highness,&#34; said the Indian; &#34;the horse has&#10;the gift of passing over seas, and of carrying his rider wherever&#10;he wishes to go.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well, your head shall answer for it,&#34; returned the monarch,&#10;&#34;and if in three months he is not safe back with me, or at any rate&#10;does not send me news of his safety, your life shall pay the&#10;penalty.&#34; So saying, he ordered his guards to seize the Indian and&#10;throw him into prison.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Meanwhile, Prince Firouz Schah had gone gaily up into the air,&#10;and for the space of an hour continued to ascend higher and higher,&#10;till the very mountains were not distinguishable from the plains.&#10;Then he began to think it was time to come down, and took for&#10;granted that, in order to do this, it was only needful to turn the&#10;screw the reverse way; but, to his surprise and horror, he found&#10;that, turn as he might, he did not make the smallest impression. He&#10;then remembered that he had never waited to ask how he was to get&#10;back to earth again, and understood the danger in which he stood.&#10;Luckily, he did not lose his head, and set about examining the&#10;horse&#39;s neck with great care, till at last, to his intense joy, he&#10;discovered a tiny little peg, much smaller than the other, close to&#10;the right ear. This he turned, and found him-self dropping to the&#10;earth, though more slowly than he had left it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was now dark, and as the prince could see nothing, he was&#10;obliged, not without some feeling of disquiet, to allow the horse&#10;to direct his own course, and midnight was already passed before&#10;Prince Firouz Schah again touched the ground, faint and weary from&#10;his long ride, and from the fact that he had eaten nothing since&#10;early morning.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The first thing he did on dismounting was to try to find out&#10;where he was, and, as far as he could discover in the thick&#10;darkness, he found himself on the terraced roof of a huge palace,&#10;with a balustrade of marble running round. In one corner of the&#10;terrace stood a small door, opening on to a staircase which led&#10;down into the palace.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Some people might have hesitated before exploring further, but&#10;not so the prince. &#34;I am doing no harm,&#34; he said, &#34;and whoever the&#10;owner may be, he will not touch me when he sees I am unarmed,&#34; and&#10;in dread of making a false step, he went cautiously down the&#10;staircase. On a landing, he noticed an open door, beyond which was&#10;a faintly lighted hall.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Before entering, the prince paused and listened, but he heard&#10;nothing except the sound of men snoring. By the light of a lantern&#10;suspended from the roof, he perceived a row of black guards&#10;sleeping, each with a naked sword lying by him, and he understood&#10;that the hall must form the ante-room to the chamber of some queen&#10;or princess.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Standing quite still, Prince Firouz Schah looked about him, till&#10;his eyes grew accustomed to the gloom, and he noticed a bright&#10;light shining through a curtain in one corner. He then made his way&#10;softly towards it, and, drawing aside its folds, passed into a&#10;magnificent chamber full of sleeping women, all lying on low&#10;couches, except one, who was on a sofa; and this one, he knew, must&#10;be the princess.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Gently stealing up to the side of her bed he looked at her, and&#10;saw that she was more beautiful than any woman he had ever beheld.&#10;But, fascinated though he was, he was well aware of the danger of&#10;his position, as one cry of surprise would awake the guards, and&#10;cause his certain death.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So sinking quietly on his knees, he took hold of the sleeve of&#10;the princess and drew her arm lightly towards him. The princess&#10;opened her eyes, and seeing before her a handsome well-dressed man,&#10;she remained speechless with astonishment.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;This favourable moment was seized by the prince, who bowing low&#10;while he knelt, thus addressed her:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You behold, madame, a prince in distress, son to the King of&#10;Persia, who, owing to an adventure so strange that you will&#10;scarcely believe it, finds himself here, a suppliant for your&#10;protection. But yesterday, I was in my father&#39;s court, engaged in&#10;the celebration of our most solemn festival; to-day, I am in an&#10;unknown land, in danger of my life.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now the princess whose mercy Prince Firouz Schah implored was&#10;the eldest daughter of the King of Bengal, who was enjoying rest&#10;and change in the palace her father had built her, at a little&#10;distance from the capital. She listened kindly to what he had to&#10;say, and then answered:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Prince, be not uneasy; hospitality and humanity are practised&#10;as widely in Bengal as they are in Persia. The protection you ask&#10;will be given you by all. You have my word for it.&#34; And as the&#10;prince was about to thank her for her goodness, she added quickly,&#10;&#34;However great may be my curiosity to learn by what means you have&#10;travelled here so speedily, I know that you must be faint for want&#10;of food, so I shall give orders to my women to take you to one of&#10;my chambers, where you will be provided with supper, and left to&#10;repose.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;By this time the princess&#39;s attendants were all awake, and&#10;listening to the conversation. At a sign from their mistress they&#10;rose, dressed themselves hastily, and snatching up some of the&#10;tapers which lighted the room, conducted the prince to a large and&#10;lofty room, where two of the number prepared his bed, and the rest&#10;went down to the kitchen, from which they soon returned with all&#10;sorts of dishes. Then, showing him cupboards filled with dresses&#10;and linen, they quitted the room.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;During their absence the Princess of Bengal, who had been&#10;greatly struck by the beauty of the prince, tried in vain to go to&#10;sleep again. It was of no use: she felt broad awake, and when her&#10;women entered the room, she inquired eagerly if the prince had all&#10;he wanted, and what they thought of him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Madame,&#34; they replied, &#34;it is of course impossible for us to&#10;tell what impression this young man has made on you. For ourselves,&#10;we think you would be fortunate if the king your father should&#10;allow you to marry anyone so amiable. Certainly there is no one in&#10;the Court of Bengal who can be compared with him.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;These flattering observations were by no means displeasing to&#10;the princess, but as she did not wish to betray her own feelings&#10;she merely said, &#34;You are all a set of chatterboxes; go back to&#10;bed, and let me sleep.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When she dressed the following morning, her maids noticed that,&#10;contrary to her usual habit, the princess was very particular about&#10;her toilette, and insisted on her hair being dressed two or three&#10;times over. &#34;For,&#34; she said to herself, &#34;if my appearance was not&#10;displeasing to the prince when he saw me in the condition I was,&#10;how much more will he be struck with me when he beholds me with all&#10;my charms.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then she placed in her hair the largest and most brilliant&#10;diamonds she could find, with a necklace, bracelets and girdle, all&#10;of precious stones. And over her shoulders her ladies put a robe of&#10;the richest stuff in all the Indies, that no one was allowed to&#10;wear except members of the royal family. When she was fully dressed&#10;according to her wishes, she sent to know if the Prince of Persia&#10;was awake and ready to receive her, as she desired to present&#10;herself before him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When the princess&#39;s messenger entered his room, Prince Firouz&#10;Schah was in the act of leaving it, to inquire if he might be&#10;allowed to pay his homage to her mistress: but on hearing the&#10;princess&#39;s wishes, he at once gave way. &#34;Her will is my law,&#34; he&#10;said, &#34;I am only here to obey her orders.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In a few moments the princess herself appeared, and after the&#10;usual compliments had passed between them, the princess sat down on&#10;a sofa, and began to explain to the prince her reasons for not&#10;giving him an audience in her own apartments. &#34;Had I done so,&#34; she&#10;said, &#34;we might have been interrupted at any hour by the chief of&#10;the eunuchs, who has the right to enter whenever it pleases him,&#10;whereas this is forbidden ground. I am all impatience to learn the&#10;wonderful accident which has procured the pleasure of your arrival,&#10;and that is why I have come to you here, where no one can intrude&#10;upon us. Begin then, I entreat you, without delay.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So the prince began at the beginning, and told all the story of&#10;the festival of Nedrouz held yearly in Persia, and of the splendid&#10;spectacles celebrated in its honour. But when he came to the&#10;enchanted horse, the princess declared that she could never have&#10;imagined anything half so surprising. &#34;Well then,&#34; continued the&#10;prince, &#34;you can easily understand how the King my father, who has&#10;a passion for all curious things, was seized with a violent desire&#10;to possess this horse, and asked the Indian what sum he would take&#10;for it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The man&#39;s answer was absolutely absurd, as you will agree, when&#10;I tell you that it was nothing less than the hand of the princess&#10;my sister; but though all the bystanders laughed and mocked, and I&#10;was beside myself with rage, I saw to my despair that my father&#10;could not make up his mind to treat the insolent proposal as it&#10;deserved. I tried to argue with him, but in vain. He only begged me&#10;to examine the horse with a view (as I quite understood) of making&#10;me more sensible of its value.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;To please my father, I mounted the horse, and, without waiting&#10;for any instructions from the Indian, turned the peg as I had seen&#10;him do. In an instant I was soaring upwards, much quicker than an&#10;arrow could fly, and I felt as if I must be getting so near the sky&#10;that I should soon hit my head against it! I could see nothing&#10;beneath me, and for some time was so confused that I did not even&#10;know in what direction I was travelling. At last, when it was&#10;growing dark, I found another screw, and on turning it, the horse&#10;began slowly to sink towards the earth. I was forced to trust to&#10;chance, and to see what fate had in store, and it was already past&#10;midnight when I found myself on the roof of this palace. I crept&#10;down the little staircase, and made directly for a light which I&#10;perceived through an open door&#8212;I peeped cautiously in, and saw, as&#10;you will guess, the eunuchs lying asleep on the floor. I knew the&#10;risks I ran, but my need was so great that I paid no attention to&#10;them, and stole safely past your guards, to the curtain which&#10;concealed your doorway.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The rest, Princess, you know; and it only remains for me to&#10;thank you for the kindness you have shown me, and to assure you of&#10;my gratitude. By the law of nations, I am already your slave, and I&#10;have only my heart, that is my own, to offer you. But what am I&#10;saying? My own? Alas, madame, it was yours from the first moment I&#10;beheld you!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The air with which he said these words could have left no doubt&#10;on the mind of the princess as to the effect of her charms, and the&#10;blush which mounted to her face only increased her beauty.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Prince,&#34; returned she as soon as her confusion permitted her to&#10;speak, &#34;you have given me the greatest pleasure, and I have&#10;followed you closely in all your adventures, and though you are&#10;positively sitting before me, I even trembled at your danger in the&#10;upper regions of the air! Let me say what a debt I owe to the&#10;chance that has led you to my house; you could have entered none&#10;which would have given you a warmer welcome. As to your being a&#10;slave, of course that is merely a joke, and my reception must&#10;itself have assured you that you are as free here as at your&#10;father&#39;s court. As to your heart,&#34; continued she in tones of&#10;encouragement, &#34;I am quite sure that must have been disposed of&#10;long ago, to some princess who is well worthy of it, and I could&#10;not think of being the cause of your unfaithfulness to her.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Prince Firouz Schah was about to protest that there was no lady&#10;with any prior claims, but he was stopped by the entrance of one of&#10;the princess&#39;s attendants, who announced that dinner was served,&#10;and, after all, neither was sorry for the interruption.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Dinner was laid in a magnificent apartment, and the table was&#10;covered with delicious fruits; while during the repast richly&#10;dressed girls sang softly and sweetly to stringed instruments.&#10;After the prince and princess had finished, they passed into a&#10;small room hung with blue and gold, looking out into a garden&#10;stocked with flowers and arbutus trees, quite different from any&#10;that were to be found in Persia.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Princess,&#34; observed the young man, &#34;till now I had always&#10;believed that Persia could boast finer palaces and more lovely&#10;gardens than any kingdom upon earth. But my eyes have been opened,&#10;and I begin to perceive that, wherever there is a great king he&#10;will surround himself with buildings worthy of him.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Prince,&#34; replied the Princess of Bengal, &#34;I have no idea what a&#10;Persian palace is like, so I am unable to make comparisons. I do&#10;not wish to depreciate my own palace, but I can assure you that it&#10;is very poor beside that of the King my father, as you will agree&#10;when you have been there to greet him, as I hope you will shortly&#10;do.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now the princess hoped that, by bringing about a meeting between&#10;the prince and her father, the King would be so struck with the&#10;young man&#39;s distinguished air and fine manners, that he would offer&#10;him his daughter to wife. But the reply of the Prince of Persia to&#10;her suggestion was not quite what she wished.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Madame,&#34; he said, &#34;by taking advantage of your proposal to&#10;visit the palace of the King of Bengal, I should satisfy not merely&#10;my curiosity, but also the sentiments of respect with which I&#10;regard him. But, Princess, I am persuaded that you will feel with&#10;me, that I cannot possibly present myself before so great a&#10;sovereign without the attendants suitable to my rank. He would&#10;think me an adventurer.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;If that is all,&#34; she answered, &#34;you can get as many attendants&#10;here as you please. There are plenty of Persian merchants, and as&#10;for money, my treasury is always open to you. Take what you&#10;please.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Prince Firouz Schah guessed what prompted so much kindness on&#10;the part of the princess, and was much touched by it. Still his&#10;passion, which increased every moment, did not make him forget his&#10;duty. So he replied without hesitation:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I do not know, Princess, how to express my gratitude for your&#10;obliging offer, which I would accept at once if it were not for the&#10;recollection of all the uneasiness the King my father must be&#10;suffering on my account. I should be unworthy indeed of all the&#10;love he showers upon me, if I did not return to him at the first&#10;possible moment. For, while I am enjoying the society of the most&#10;amiable of all princesses, he is, I am quite convinced, plunged in&#10;the deepest grief, having lost all hope of seeing me again. I am&#10;sure you will understand my position, and will feel that to remain&#10;away one instant longer than is necessary would not only be&#10;ungrateful on my part, but perhaps even a crime, for how do I know&#10;if my absence may not break his heart?&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But,&#34; continued the prince, &#34;having obeyed the voice of my&#10;conscience, I shall count the moments when, with your gracious&#10;permission, I may present myself before the King of Bengal, not as&#10;a wanderer, but as a prince, to implore the favour of your hand. My&#10;father has always informed me that in my marriage I shall be left&#10;quite free, but I am persuaded that I have only to describe your&#10;generosity, for my wishes to become his own.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Princess of Bengal was too reasonable not to accept the&#10;explanation offered by Prince Firouz Schah, but she was much&#10;disturbed at his intention of departing at once, for she feared&#10;that, no sooner had he left her, than the impression she had made&#10;on him would fade away. So she made one more effort to keep him,&#10;and after assuring him that she entirely approved of his anxiety to&#10;see his father, begged him to give her a day or two more of his&#10;company.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In common politeness the prince could hardly refuse this&#10;request, and the princess set about inventing every kind of&#10;amusement for him, and succeeded so well that two months slipped by&#10;almost unnoticed, in balls, spectacles and in hunting, of which,&#10;when unattended by danger, the princess was passionately fond. But&#10;at last, one day, he declared seriously that he could neglect his&#10;duty no longer, and entreated her to put no further obstacles in&#10;his way, promising at the same time to return, as soon as he could,&#10;with all the magnificence due both to her and to himself.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Princess,&#34; he added, &#34;it may be that in your heart you class me&#10;with those false lovers whose devotion cannot stand the test of&#10;absence. If you do, you wrong me; and were it not for fear of&#10;offending you, I would beseech you to come with me, for my life can&#10;only be happy when passed with you. As for your reception at the&#10;Persian Court, it will be as warm as your merits deserve; and as&#10;for what concerns the King of Bengal, he must be much more&#10;indifferent to your welfare than you have led me to believe if he&#10;does not give his consent to our marriage.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The princess could not find words in which to reply to the&#10;arguments of the Prince of Persia, but her silence and her downcast&#10;eyes spoke for her, and declared that she had no objection to&#10;accompanying him on his travels.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The only difficulty that occurred to her was that Prince Firouz&#10;Schah did not know how to manage the horse, and she dreaded lest&#10;they might find themselves in the same plight as before. But the&#10;prince soothed her fears so successfully, that she soon had no&#10;other thought than to arrange for their flight so secretly, that no&#10;one in the palace should suspect it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;This was done, and early the following morning, when the whole&#10;palace was wrapped in sleep, she stole up on to the roof, where the&#10;prince was already awaiting her, with his horse&#39;s head towards&#10;Persia. He mounted first and helped the princess up behind; then,&#10;when she was firmly seated, with her hands holding tightly to his&#10;belt, he touched the screw, and the horse began to leave the earth&#10;quickly behind him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He travelled with his accustomed speed, and Prince Firouz Schah&#10;guided him so well that in two hours and a half from the time of&#10;starting, he saw the capital of Persia lying beneath him. He&#10;determined to alight neither in the great square from which he had&#10;started, nor in the Sultan&#39;s palace, but in a country house at a&#10;little distance from the town. Here he showed the princess a&#10;beautiful suite of rooms, and begged her to rest, while he informed&#10;his father of their arrival, and prepared a public reception worthy&#10;of her rank. Then he ordered a horse to be saddled, and set&#10;out.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;All the way through the streets he was welcomed with shouts of&#10;joy by the people, who had long lost all hope of seeing him again.&#10;On reaching the palace, he found the Sultan surrounded by his&#10;ministers, all clad in the deepest mourning, and his father almost&#10;went out of his mind with surprise and delight at the mere sound of&#10;his son&#39;s voice. When he had calmed down a little, he begged the&#10;prince to relate his adventures.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The prince at once seized the opening thus given him, and told&#10;the whole story of his treatment by the Princess of Bengal, not&#10;even concealing the fact that she had fallen in love with him.&#10;&#34;And, Sire,&#34; ended the prince, &#34;having given my royal word that you&#10;would not refuse your consent to our marriage, I persuaded her to&#10;return with me on the Indian&#39;s horse. I have left her in one of&#10;your Highness&#39;s country houses, where she is waiting anxiously to&#10;be assured that I have not promised in vain.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As he said this the prince was about to throw himself at the&#10;feet of the Sultan, but his father prevented him, and embracing him&#10;again, said eagerly:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My son, not only do I gladly consent to your marriage with the&#10;Princess of Bengal, but I will hasten to pay my respects to her,&#10;and to thank her in my own person for the benefits she has&#10;conferred on you. I will then bring her back with me, and make all&#10;arrangements for the wedding to be celebrated to-day.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So the Sultan gave orders that the habits of mourning worn by&#10;the people should be thrown off and that there should be a concert&#10;of drums, trumpets and cymbals. Also that the Indian should be&#10;taken from prison, and brought before him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;His commands were obeyed, and the Indian was led into his&#10;presence, surrounded by guards. &#34;I have kept you locked up,&#34; said&#10;the Sultan, &#34;so that in case my son was lost, your life should pay&#10;the penalty. He has now returned; so take your horse, and begone&#10;for ever.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Indian hastily quitted the presence of the Sultan, and when&#10;he was outside, he inquired of the man who had taken him out of&#10;prison where the prince had really been all this time, and what he&#10;had been doing. They told him the whole story, and how the Princess&#10;of Bengal was even then awaiting in the country palace the consent&#10;of the Sultan, which at once put into the Indian&#39;s head a plan of&#10;revenge for the treatment he had experienced. Going straight to the&#10;country house, he informed the doorkeeper who was left in charge&#10;that he had been sent by the Sultan and by the Prince of Persia to&#10;fetch the princess on the enchanted horse, and to bring her to the&#10;palace.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The doorkeeper knew the Indian by sight, and was of course aware&#10;that nearly three months before he had been thrown into prison by&#10;the Sultan; and seeing him at liberty, the man took for granted&#10;that he was speaking the truth, and made no difficulty about&#10;leading him before the Princess of Bengal; while on her side,&#10;hearing that he had come from the prince, the lady gladly consented&#10;to do what he wished.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Indian, delighted with the success of his scheme, mounted&#10;the horse, assisted the princess to mount behind him, and turned&#10;the peg at the very moment that the prince was leaving the palace&#10;in Schiraz for the country house, followed closely by the Sultan&#10;and all the court. Knowing this, the Indian deliberately steered&#10;the horse right above the city, in order that his revenge for his&#10;unjust imprisonment might be all the quicker and sweeter.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When the Sultan of Persia saw the horse and its riders, he&#10;stopped short with astonishment and horror, and broke out into&#10;oaths and curses, which the Indian heard quite unmoved, knowing&#10;that he was perfectly safe from pursuit. But mortified and furious&#10;as the Sultan was, his feelings were nothing to those of Prince&#10;Firouz Schah, when he saw the object of his passionate devotion&#10;being borne rapidly away. And while he was struck speechless with&#10;grief and remorse at not having guarded her better, she vanished&#10;swiftly out of his sight. What was he to do? Should he follow his&#10;father into the palace, and there give reins to his despair? Both&#10;his love and his courage alike forbade it; and he continued his way&#10;to the palace.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The sight of the prince showed the doorkeeper of what folly he&#10;had been guilty, and flinging himself at his master&#39;s feet,&#10;implored his pardon. &#34;Rise,&#34; said the prince, &#34;I am the cause of&#10;this misfortune, and not you. Go and find me the dress of a&#10;dervish, but beware of saying it is for me.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At a short distance from the country house, a convent of&#10;dervishes was situated, and the superior, or scheih, was the&#10;doorkeeper&#39;s friend. So by means of a false story made up on the&#10;spur of the moment, it was easy enough to get hold of a dervish&#39;s&#10;dress, which the prince at once put on, instead of his own.&#10;Disguised like this and concealing about him a box of pearls and&#10;diamonds he had intended as a present to the princess, he left the&#10;house at nightfall, uncertain where he should go, but firmly&#10;resolved not to return without her.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Meanwhile the Indian had turned the horse in such a direction&#10;that, before many hours had passed, it had entered a wood close to&#10;the capital of the kingdom of Cashmere. Feeling very hungry, and&#10;supposing that the princess also might be in want of food, he&#10;brought his steed down to the earth, and left the princess in a&#10;shady place, on the banks of a clear stream.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At first, when the princess had found herself alone, the idea&#10;had occurred to her of trying to escape and hide herself. But as&#10;she had eaten scarcely anything since she had left Bengal, she felt&#10;she was too weak to venture far, and was obliged to abandon her&#10;design. On the return of the Indian with meats of various kinds,&#10;she began to eat voraciously, and soon had regained sufficient&#10;courage to reply with spirit to his insolent remarks. Goaded by his&#10;threats she sprang to her feet, calling loudly for help, and&#10;luckily her cries were heard by a troop of horsemen, who rode up to&#10;inquire what was the matter.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Now the leader of these horsemen was the Sultan of Cashmere,&#10;returning from the chase, and he instantly turned to the Indian to&#10;inquire who he was, and whom he had with him. The Indian rudely&#10;answered that it was his wife, and there was no occasion for anyone&#10;else to interfere between them.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The princess, who, of course, was ignorant of the rank of her&#10;deliverer, denied altogether the Indian&#39;s story. &#34;My lord,&#34; she&#10;cried, &#34;whoever you may be, put no faith in this impostor. He is an&#10;abominable magician, who has this day torn me from the Prince of&#10;Persia, my destined husband, and has brought me here on this&#10;enchanted horse.&#34; She would have continued, but her tears choked&#10;her, and the Sultan of Cashmere, convinced by her beauty and her&#10;distinguished air of the truth of her tale, ordered his followers&#10;to cut off the Indian&#39;s head, which was done immediately.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But rescued though she was from one peril, it seemed as if she&#10;had only fallen into another. The Sultan commanded a horse to be&#10;given her, and conducted her to his own palace, where he led her to&#10;a beautiful apartment, and selected female slaves to wait on her,&#10;and eunuchs to be her guard. Then, without allowing her time to&#10;thank him for all he had done, he bade her repose, saying she&#10;should tell him her adventures on the following day.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The princess fell asleep, flattering herself that she had only&#10;to relate her story for the Sultan to be touched by compassion, and&#10;to restore her to the prince without delay. But a few hours were to&#10;undeceive her.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When the King of Cashmere had quitted her presence the evening&#10;before, he had resolved that the sun should not set again without&#10;the princess becoming his wife, and at daybreak proclamation of his&#10;intention was made throughout the town, by the sound of drums,&#10;trumpets, cymbals, and other instruments calculated to fill the&#10;heart with joy. The Princess of Bengal was early awakened by the&#10;noise, but she did not for one moment imagine that it had anything&#10;to do with her, till the Sultan, arriving as soon as she was&#10;dressed to inquire after her health, informed her that the trumpet&#10;blasts she heard were part of the solemn marriage ceremonies, for&#10;which he begged her to prepare. This unexpected announcement caused&#10;the princess such terror that she sank down in a dead faint.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The slaves that were in waiting ran to her aid, and the Sultan&#10;himself did his best to bring her back to consciousness, but for a&#10;long while it was all to no purpose. At length her senses began&#10;slowly to come back to her, and then, rather than break faith with&#10;the Prince of Persia by consenting to such a marriage, she&#10;determined to feign madness. So she began by saying all sorts of&#10;absurdities, and using all kinds of strange gestures, while the&#10;Sultan stood watching her with sorrow and surprise. But as this&#10;sudden seizure showed no sign of abating, he left her to her women,&#10;ordering them to take the greatest care of her. Still, as the day&#10;went on, the malady seemed to become worse, and by night it was&#10;almost violent.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Days passed in this manner, till at last the Sultan of Cashmere&#10;decided to summon all the doctors of his court to consult together&#10;over her sad state. Their answer was that madness is of so many&#10;different kinds that it was impossible to give an opinion on the&#10;case without seeing the princess, so the Sultan gave orders that&#10;they were to be introduced into her chamber, one by one, every man&#10;according to his rank.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;This decision had been foreseen by the princess, who knew quite&#10;well that if once she allowed the physicians to feel her pulse, the&#10;most ignorant of them would discover that she was in perfectly good&#10;health, and that her madness was feigned, so as each man&#10;approached, she broke out into such violent paroxysms, that not one&#10;dared to lay a finger on her. A few, who pretended to be cleverer&#10;than the rest, declared that they could diagnose sick people only&#10;from sight, ordered her certain potions, which she made no&#10;difficulty about taking, as she was persuaded they were all&#10;harmless.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When the Sultan of Cashmere saw that the court doctors could do&#10;nothing towards curing the princess, he called in those of the&#10;city, who fared no better. Then he had recourse to the most&#10;celebrated physicians in the other large towns, but finding that&#10;the task was beyond their science, he finally sent messengers into&#10;the other neighbouring states, with a memorandum containing full&#10;particulars of the princess&#39;s madness, offering at the same time to&#10;pay the expenses of any physician who would come and see for&#10;himself, and a handsome reward to the one who should cure her. In&#10;answer to this proclamation many foreign professors flocked into&#10;Cashmere, but they naturally were not more successful than the rest&#10;had been, as the cure depended neither on them nor their skill, but&#10;only on the princess herself.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was during this time that Prince Firouz Schah, wandering&#10;sadly and hopelessly from place to place, arrived in a large city&#10;of India, where he heard a great deal of talk about the Princess of&#10;Bengal who had gone out of her senses, on the very day that she was&#10;to have been married to the Sultan of Cashmere. This was quite&#10;enough to induce him to take the road to Cashmere, and to inquire&#10;at the first inn at which he lodged in the capital the full&#10;particulars of the story. When he knew that he had at last found&#10;the princess whom he had so long lost, he set about devising a plan&#10;for her rescue.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The first thing he did was to procure a doctor&#39;s robe, so that&#10;his dress, added to the long beard he had allowed to grow on his&#10;travels, might unmistakably proclaim his profession. He then lost&#10;no time in going to the palace, where he obtained an audience of&#10;the chief usher, and while apologising for his boldness in&#10;presuming to think that he could cure the princess, where so many&#10;others had failed, declared that he had the secret of certain&#10;remedies, which had hitherto never failed of their effect.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The chief usher assured him that he was heartily welcome, and&#10;that the Sultan would receive him with pleasure; and in case of&#10;success, he would gain a magnificent reward.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When the Prince of Persia, in the disguise of a physician, was&#10;brought before him, the Sultan wasted no time in talking, beyond&#10;remarking that the mere sight of a doctor threw the princess into&#10;transports of rage. He then led the prince up to a room under the&#10;roof, which had an opening through which he might observe the&#10;princess, without himself being seen.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The prince looked, and beheld the princess reclining on a sofa&#10;with tears in her eyes, singing softly to herself a song bewailing&#10;her sad destiny, which had deprived her, perhaps for ever, of a&#10;being she so tenderly loved. The young man&#39;s heart beat fast as he&#10;listened, for he needed no further proof that her madness was&#10;feigned, and that it was love of him which had caused her to resort&#10;to this species of trick. He softly left his hiding-place, and&#10;returned to the Sultan, to whom he reported that he was sure from&#10;certain signs that the princess&#39;s malady was not incurable, but&#10;that he must see her and speak with her alone.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Sultan made no difficulty in consenting to this, and&#10;commanded that he should be ushered in to the princess&#39;s apartment.&#10;The moment she caught sight of his physician&#39;s robe, she sprang&#10;from her seat in a fury, and heaped insults upon him. The prince&#10;took no notice of her behaviour, and approaching quite close, so&#10;that his words might be heard by her alone, he said in a low&#10;whisper, &#34;Look at me, princess, and you will see that I am no&#10;doctor, but the Prince of Persia, who has come to set you&#10;free.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At the sound of his voice, the Princess of Bengal suddenly grew&#10;calm, and an expression of joy overspread her face, such as only&#10;comes when what we wish for most and expect the least suddenly&#10;happens to us. For some time she was too enchanted to speak, and&#10;Prince Firouz Schah took advantage of her silence to explain to her&#10;all that had occurred, his despair at watching her disappear before&#10;his very eyes, the oath he had sworn to follow her over the world,&#10;and his rapture at finally discovering her in the palace at&#10;Cashmere. When he had finished, he begged in his turn that the&#10;princess would tell him how she had come there, so that he might&#10;the better devise some means of rescuing her from the tyranny of&#10;the Sultan.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It needed but a few words from the princess to make him&#10;acquainted with the whole situation, and how she had been forced to&#10;play the part of a mad woman in order to escape from a marriage&#10;with the Sultan, who had not had sufficient politeness even to ask&#10;her consent. If necessary, she added, she had resolved to die&#10;sooner than permit herself to be forced into such a union, and&#10;break faith with a prince whom she loved.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The prince then inquired if she knew what had become of the&#10;enchanted horse since the Indian&#39;s death, but the princess could&#10;only reply that she had heard nothing about it. Still she did not&#10;suppose that the horse could have been forgotten by the Sultan,&#10;after all she had told him of its value.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;To this the prince agreed, and they consulted together over a&#10;plan by which she might be able to make her escape and return with&#10;him into Persia. And as the first step, she was to dress herself&#10;with care, and receive the Sultan with civility when he visited her&#10;next morning.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Sultan was transported with delight on learning the result&#10;of the interview, and his opinion of the doctor&#39;s skill was raised&#10;still higher when, on the following day, the princess behaved&#10;towards him in such a way as to persuade him that her complete cure&#10;would not be long delayed. However he contented himself with&#10;assuring her how happy he was to see her health so much improved,&#10;and exhorted her to make every use of so clever a physician, and to&#10;repose entire confidence in him. Then he retired, without awaiting&#10;any reply from the princess.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Prince of Persia left the room at the same time, and asked&#10;if he might be allowed humbly to inquire by what means the Princess&#10;of Bengal had reached Cashmere, which was so far distant from her&#10;father&#39;s kingdom, and how she came to be there alone. The Sultan&#10;thought the question very natural, and told him the same story that&#10;the Princess of Bengal had done, adding that he had ordered the&#10;enchanted horse to be taken to his treasury as a curiosity, though&#10;he was quite ignorant how it could be used.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Sire,&#34; replied the physician, &#34;your Highness&#39;s tale has&#10;supplied me with the clue I needed to complete the recovery of the&#10;princess. During her voyage hither on an enchanted horse, a portion&#10;of its enchantment has by some means been communicated to her&#10;person, and it can only be dissipated by certain perfumes of which&#10;I possess the secret. If your Highness will deign to consent, and&#10;to give the court and the people one of the most astonishing&#10;spectacles they have ever witnessed, command the horse to be&#10;brought into the big square outside the palace, and leave the rest&#10;to me. I promise that in a very few moments, in presence of all the&#10;assembled multitude, you shall see the princess as healthy both in&#10;mind and body as ever she was in her life. And in order to make the&#10;spectacle as impressive as possible, I would suggest that she&#10;should be richly dressed and covered with the noblest jewels of the&#10;crown.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Sultan readily agreed to all that the prince proposed, and&#10;the following morning he desired that the enchanted horse should be&#10;taken from the treasury, and brought into the great square of the&#10;palace. Soon the rumour began to spread through the town, that&#10;something extraordinary was about to happen, and such a crowd began&#10;to collect that the guards had to be called out to keep order, and&#10;to make a way for the enchanted horse.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When all was ready, the Sultan appeared, and took his place on a&#10;platform, surrounded by the chief nobles and officers of his court.&#10;When they were seated, the Princess of Bengal was seen leaving the&#10;palace, accompanied by the ladies who had been assigned to her by&#10;the Sultan. She slowly approached the enchanted horse, and with the&#10;help of her ladies, she mounted on its back. Directly she was in&#10;the saddle, with her feet in the stirrups and the bridle in her&#10;hand, the physician placed around the horse some large braziers&#10;full of burning coals, into each of which he threw a perfume&#10;composed of all sorts of delicious scents. Then he crossed his&#10;hands over his breast, and with lowered eyes walked three times&#10;round the horse, muttering the while certain words. Soon there&#10;arose from the burning braziers a thick smoke which almost&#10;concealed both the horse and princess, and this was the moment for&#10;which he had been waiting. Springing lightly up behind the lady, he&#10;leaned forward and turned the peg, and as the horse darted up into&#10;the air, he cried aloud so that his words were heard by all&#10;present, &#34;Sultan of Cashmere, when you wish to marry princesses who&#10;have sought your protection, learn first to gain their&#10;consent.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was in this way that the Prince of Persia rescued the&#10;Princess of Bengal, and returned with her to Persia, where they&#10;descended this time before the palace of the King himself. The&#10;marriage was only delayed just long enough to make the ceremony as&#10;brilliant as possible, and, as soon as the rejoicings were over, an&#10;ambassador was sent to the King of Bengal, to inform him of what&#10;had passed, and to ask his approbation of the alliance between the&#10;two countries, which he heartily gave.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 3, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/208', :deleted => 0)













Text.create(:title => coder.decode('The Story of Two Sisters Who Were Jealous&#10;of Their Younger Sister'), :content => coder.decode('&#10;&#60;p&#62;Once upon a time there reigned over Persia a Sultan named&#10;Kosrouschah, who from his boyhood had been fond of putting on a&#10;disguise and seeking adventures in all parts of the city,&#10;accompanied by one of his officers, disguised like himself. And no&#10;sooner was his father buried and the ceremonies over that marked&#10;his accession to the throne, than the young man hastened to throw&#10;off his robes of state, and calling to his vizir to make ready&#10;likewise, stole out in the simple dress of a private citizen into&#10;the less known streets of the capital.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Passing down a lonely street, the Sultan heard women&#39;s voices in&#10;loud discussion; and peeping through a crack in the door, he saw&#10;three sisters, sitting on a sofa in a large hall, talking in a very&#10;lively and earnest manner. Judging from the few words that reached&#10;his ear, they were each explaining what sort of men they wished to&#10;marry.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I ask nothing better,&#34; cried the eldest, &#34;than to have the&#10;Sultan&#39;s baker for a husband. Think of being able to eat as much as&#10;one wanted, of that delicious bread that is baked for his Highness&#10;alone! Let us see if your wish is as good as mine.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I,&#34; replied the second sister, &#34;should be quite content with&#10;the Sultan&#39;s head cook. What delicate stews I should feast upon!&#10;And, as I am persuaded that the Sultan&#39;s bread is used all through&#10;the palace, I should have that into the bargain. You see, my dear&#10;sister, my taste is as good as yours.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It was now the turn of the youngest sister, who was by far the&#10;most beautiful of the three, and had, besides, more sense than the&#10;other two. &#34;As for me,&#34; she said, &#34;I should take a higher flight;&#10;and if we are to wish for husbands, nothing less than the Sultan&#10;himself will do for me.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Sultan was so much amused by the conversation he had&#10;overheard, that he made up his mind to gratify their wishes, and&#10;turning to the grand-vizir, he bade him note the house, and on the&#10;following morning to bring the ladies into his presence.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The grand-vizir fulfilled his commission, and hardly giving them&#10;time to change their dresses, desired the three sisters to follow&#10;him to the palace. Here they were presented one by one, and when&#10;they had bowed before the Sultan, the sovereign abruptly put the&#10;question to them:&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Tell me, do you remember what you wished for last night, when&#10;you were making merry? Fear nothing, but answer me the truth.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;These words, which were so unexpected, threw the sisters into&#10;great confusion, their eyes fell, and the blushes of the youngest&#10;did not fail to make an impression on the heart of the Sultan. All&#10;three remained silent, and he hastened to continue: &#34;Do not be&#10;afraid, I have not the slightest intention of giving you pain, and&#10;let me tell you at once, that I know the wishes formed by each one.&#10;You,&#34; he said, turning to the youngest, &#34;who desired to have me for&#10;an husband, shall be satisfied this very day. And you,&#34; he added,&#10;addressing himself to the other two, &#34;shall be married at the same&#10;moment to my baker and to my chief cook.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When the Sultan had finished speaking the three sisters flung&#10;themselves at his feet, and the youngest faltered out, &#34;Oh, sire,&#10;since you know my foolish words, believe, I pray you, that they&#10;were only said in joke. I am unworthy of the honour you propose to&#10;do me, and I can only ask pardon for my boldness.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The other sisters also tried to excuse themselves, but the&#10;Sultan would hear nothing.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No, no,&#34; he said, &#34;my mind is made up. Your wishes shall be&#10;accomplished.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So the three weddings were celebrated that same day, but with a&#10;great difference. That of the youngest was marked by all the&#10;magnificence that was customary at the marriage of the Shah of&#10;Persia, while the festivities attending the nuptials of the&#10;Sultan&#39;s baker and his chief cook were only such as were suitable&#10;to their conditions.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;This, though quite natural, was highly displeasing to the elder&#10;sisters, who fell into a passion of jealousy, which in the end&#10;caused a great deal of trouble and pain to several people. And the&#10;first time that they had the opportunity of speaking to each other,&#10;which was not till several days later at a public bath, they did&#10;not attempt to disguise their feelings.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Can you possibly understand what the Sultan saw in that little&#10;cat,&#34; said one to the other, &#34;for him to be so fascinated by&#10;her?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;He must be quite blind,&#34; returned the wife of the chief cook.&#10;&#34;As for her looking a little younger than we do, what does that&#10;matter? You would have made a far better Sultana than she.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh, I say nothing of myself,&#34; replied the elder, &#34;and if the&#10;Sultan had chosen you it would have been all very well; but it&#10;really grieves me that he should have selected a wretched little&#10;creature like that. However, I will be revenged on her somehow, and&#10;I beg you will give me your help in the matter, and to tell me&#10;anything that you can think of that is likely to mortify her.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In order to carry out their wicked scheme the two sisters met&#10;constantly to talk over their ideas, though all the while they&#10;pretended to be as friendly as ever towards the Sultana, who, on&#10;her part, invariably treated them with kindness. For a long time no&#10;plan occurred to the two plotters that seemed in the least likely&#10;to meet with success, but at length the expected birth of an heir&#10;gave them the chance for which they had been hoping.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;They obtained permission of the Sultan to take up their abode in&#10;the palace for some weeks, and never left their sister night or&#10;day. When at last a little boy, beautiful as the sun, was born,&#10;they laid him in his cradle and carried it down to a canal which&#10;passed through the grounds of the palace. Then, leaving it to its&#10;fate, they informed the Sultan that instead of the son he had so&#10;fondly desired the Sultana had given birth to a puppy. At this&#10;dreadful news the Sultan was so overcome with rage and grief that&#10;it was with great difficulty that the grand-vizir managed to save&#10;the Sultana from his wrath.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Meanwhile the cradle continued to float peacefully along the&#10;canal till, on the outskirts of the royal gardens, it was suddenly&#10;perceived by the intendant, one of the highest and most respected&#10;officials in the kingdom.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Go,&#34; he said to a gardener who was working near, &#34;and get that&#10;cradle out for me.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The gardener did as he was bid, and soon placed the cradle in&#10;the hands of the intendant.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The official was much astonished to see that the cradle, which&#10;he had supposed to be empty, contained a baby, which, young though&#10;it was, already gave promise of great beauty. Having no children&#10;himself, although he had been married some years, it at once&#10;occurred to him that here was a child which he could take and bring&#10;up as his own. And, bidding the man pick up the cradle and follow&#10;him, he turned towards home.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My wife,&#34; he exclaimed as he entered the room, &#34;heaven has&#10;denied us any children, but here is one that has been sent in their&#10;place. Send for a nurse, and I will do what is needful publicly to&#10;recognise it as my son.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The wife accepted the baby with joy, and though the intendant&#10;saw quite well that it must have come from the royal palace, he did&#10;not think it was his business to inquire further into the&#10;mystery.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The following year another prince was born and sent adrift, but&#10;happily for the baby, the intendant of the gardens again was&#10;walking by the canal, and carried it home as before.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Sultan, naturally enough, was still more furious the second&#10;time than the first, but when the same curious accident was&#10;repeated in the third year he could control himself no longer, and,&#10;to the great joy of the jealous sisters, commanded that the Sultana&#10;should be executed. But the poor lady was so much beloved at Court&#10;that not even the dread of sharing her fate could prevent the&#10;grand-vizir and the courtiers from throwing themselves at the&#10;Sultan&#39;s feet and imploring him not to inflict so cruel a&#10;punishment for what, after all, was not her fault.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Let her live,&#34; entreated the grand-vizir, &#34;and banish her from&#10;your presence for the rest of her days. That in itself will be&#10;punishment enough.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;His first passion spent, the Sultan had regained his&#10;self-command. &#34;Let her live then,&#34; he said, &#34;since you have it so&#10;much at heart. But if I grant her life it shall only be on one&#10;condition, which shall make her daily pray for death. Let a box be&#10;built for her at the door of the principal mosque, and let the&#10;window of the box be always open. There she shall sit, in the&#10;coarsest clothes, and every Mussulman who enters the mosque shall&#10;spit in her face in passing. Anyone that refuses to obey shall be&#10;exposed to the same punishment himself. You, vizir, will see that&#10;my orders are carried out.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The grand-vizir saw that it was useless to say more, and, full&#10;of triumph, the sisters watched the building of the box, and then&#10;listened to the jeers of the people at the helpless Sultana sitting&#10;inside. But the poor lady bore herself with so much dignity and&#10;meekness that it was not long before she had won the sympathy of&#10;those that were best among the crowd.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But it is now time to return to the fate of the third baby, this&#10;time a princess. Like its brothers, it was found by the intendant&#10;of the gardens, and adopted by him and his wife, and all three were&#10;brought up with the greatest care and tenderness.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As the children grew older their beauty and air of distinction&#10;became more and more marked, and their manners had all the grace&#10;and ease that is proper to people of high birth. The princes had&#10;been named by their foster-father Bahman and Perviz, after two of&#10;the ancient kings of Persia, while the princess was called&#10;Parizade, or the child of the genii.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The intendant was careful to bring them up as befitted their&#10;real rank, and soon appointed a tutor to teach the young princes&#10;how to read and write. And the princess, determined not to be left&#10;behind, showed herself so anxious to learn with her brothers, that&#10;the intendant consented to her joining in their lessons, and it was&#10;not long before she knew as much as they did.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;From that time all their studies were done in common. They had&#10;the best masters for the fine arts, geography, poetry, history and&#10;science, and even for sciences which are learned by few, and every&#10;branch seemed so easy to them, that their teachers were astonished&#10;at the progress they made. The princess had a passion for music,&#10;and could sing and play upon all sorts of instruments she could&#10;also ride and drive as well as her brothers, shoot with a bow and&#10;arrow, and throw a javelin with the same skill as they, and&#10;sometimes even better.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In order to set off these accomplishments, the intendant&#10;resolved that his foster children should not be pent up any longer&#10;in the narrow borders of the palace gardens, where he had always&#10;lived, so he bought a splendid country house a few miles from the&#10;capital, surrounded by an immense park. This park he filled with&#10;wild beasts of various sorts, so that the princes and princess&#10;might hunt as much as they pleased.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When everything was ready, the intendant threw himself at the&#10;Sultan&#39;s feet, and after referring to his age and his long&#10;services, begged his Highness&#39;s permission to resign his post. This&#10;was granted by the Sultan in a few gracious words, and he then&#10;inquired what reward he could give to his faithful servant. But the&#10;intendant declared that he wished for nothing except the&#10;continuance of his Highness&#39;s favour, and prostrating himself once&#10;more, he retired from the Sultan&#39;s presence.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Five or six months passed away in the pleasures of the country,&#10;when death attacked the intendant so suddenly that he had no time&#10;to reveal the secret of their birth to his adopted children, and as&#10;his wife had long been dead also, it seemed as if the princes and&#10;the princess would never know that they had been born to a higher&#10;station than the one they filled. Their sorrow for their father was&#10;very deep, and they lived quietly on in their new home, without&#10;feeling any desire to leave it for court gaieties or intrigues.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;One day the princes as usual went out to hunt, but their sister&#10;remained alone in her apartments. While they were gone an old&#10;Mussulman devotee appeared at the door, and asked leave to enter,&#10;as it was the hour of prayer. The princess sent orders at once that&#10;the old woman was to be taken to the private oratory in the&#10;grounds, and when she had finished her prayers was to be shown the&#10;house and gardens, and then to be brought before her.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Although the old woman was very pious, she was not at all&#10;indifferent to the magnificence of all around her, which she seemed&#10;to understand as well as to admire, and when she had seen it all&#10;she was led by the servants before the princess, who was seated in&#10;a room which surpassed in splendour all the rest.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My good woman,&#34; said the princess pointing to a sofa, &#34;come and&#10;sit beside me. I am delighted at the opportunity of speaking for a&#10;few moments with so holy a person.&#34; The old woman made some&#10;objections to so much honour being done her, but the princess&#10;refused to listen, and insisted that her guest should take the best&#10;seat, and as she thought she must be tired ordered&#10;refreshments.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;While the old woman was eating, the princess put several&#10;questions to her as to her mode of life, and the pious exercises&#10;she practiced, and then inquired what she thought of the house now&#10;that she had seen it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Madam,&#34; replied the pilgrim, &#34;one must be hard indeed to please&#10;to find any fault. It is beautiful, comfortable and well ordered,&#10;and it is impossible to imagine anything more lovely than the&#10;garden. But since you ask me, I must confess that it lacks three&#10;things to make it absolutely perfect.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And what can they be?&#34; cried the princess. &#34;Only tell me, and I&#10;will lose no time in getting them.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The three things, madam,&#34; replied the old woman, &#34;are, first,&#10;the Talking Bird, whose voice draws all other singing birds to it,&#10;to join in chorus. And second, the Singing Tree, where every leaf&#10;is a song that is never silent. And lastly the Golden Water, of&#10;which it is only needful to pour a single drop into a basin for it&#10;to shoot up into a fountain, which will never be exhausted, nor&#10;will the basin ever overflow.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh, how can I thank you,&#34; cried the princess, &#34;for telling me&#10;of such treasures! But add, I pray you, to your goodness by further&#10;informing me where I can find them.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Madam,&#34; replied the pilgrim, &#34;I should ill repay the&#10;hospitality you have shown me if I refused to answer your question.&#10;The three things of which I have spoken are all to be found in one&#10;place, on the borders of this kingdom, towards India. Your&#10;messenger has only to follow the road that passes by your house,&#10;for twenty days, and at the end of that time, he is to ask the&#10;first person he meets for the Talking Bird, the Singing Tree, and&#10;the Golden Water.&#34; She then rose, and bidding farewell to the&#10;princess, went her way.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The old woman had taken her departure so abruptly that the&#10;Princess Parizade did not perceive till she was really gone that&#10;the directions were hardly clear enough to enable the search to be&#10;successful. And she was still thinking of the subject, and how&#10;delightful it would be to possess such rarities, when the princes,&#10;her brothers, returned from the chase.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What is the matter, my sister?&#34; asked Prince Bahman; &#34;why are&#10;you so grave? Are you ill? Or has anything happened?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Princess Parizade did not answer directly, but at length she&#10;raised her eyes, and replied that there was nothing wrong.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But there must be something,&#34; persisted Prince Bahman, &#34;for you&#10;to have changed so much during the short time we have been absent.&#10;Hide nothing from us, I beseech you, unless you wish us to believe&#10;that the confidence we have always had in one another is now to&#10;cease.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;When I said that it was nothing,&#34; said the princess, moved by&#10;his words, &#34;I meant that it was nothing that affected you, although&#10;I admit that it is certainly of some importance to me. Like myself,&#10;you have always thought this house that our father built for us was&#10;perfect in every respect, but only to-day I have learned that three&#10;things are still lacking to complete it. These are the Talking&#10;Bird, the Singing Tree, and the Golden Water.&#34; After explaining the&#10;peculiar qualities of each, the princess continued: &#34;It was a&#10;Mussulman devotee who told me all this, and where they might all be&#10;found. Perhaps you will think that the house is beautiful enough as&#10;it is, and that we can do quite well without them; but in this I&#10;cannot agree with you, and I shall never be content until I have&#10;got them. So counsel me, I pray, whom to send on the&#10;undertaking.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My dear sister,&#34; replied Prince Bahman, &#34;that you should care&#10;about the matter is quite enough, even if we took no interest in it&#10;ourselves. But we both feel with you, and I claim, as the elder,&#10;the right to make the first attempt, if you will tell me where I am&#10;to go, and what steps I am to take.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Prince Perviz at first objected that, being the head of the&#10;family, his brother ought not to be allowed to expose himself to&#10;danger; but Prince Bahman would hear nothing, and retired to make&#10;the needful preparations for his journey.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The next morning Prince Bahman got up very early, and after&#10;bidding farewell to his brother and sister, mounted his horse. But&#10;just as he was about to touch it with his whip, he was stopped by a&#10;cry from the princess.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh, perhaps after all you may never come back; one never can&#10;tell what accidents may happen. Give it up, I implore you, for I&#10;would a thousand times rather lose the Talking Bird, and the&#10;Singing Tree and the Golden Water, than that you should run into&#10;danger.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My dear sister,&#34; answered the prince, &#34;accidents only happen to&#10;unlucky people, and I hope that I am not one of them. But as&#10;everything is uncertain, I promise you to be very careful. Take&#10;this knife,&#34; he continued, handing her one that hung sheathed from&#10;his belt, &#34;and every now and then draw it out and look at it. As&#10;long as it keeps bright and clean as it is to-day, you will know&#10;that I am living; but if the blade is spotted with blood, it will&#10;be a sign that I am dead, and you shall weep for me.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So saying, Prince Bahman bade them farewell once more, and&#10;started on the high road, well mounted and fully armed. For twenty&#10;days he rode straight on, turning neither to the right hand nor to&#10;the left, till he found himself drawing near the frontiers of&#10;Persia. Seated under a tree by the wayside he noticed a hideous old&#10;man, with a long white moustache, and beard that almost fell to his&#10;feet. His nails had grown to an enormous length, and on his head he&#10;wore a huge hat, which served him for an umbrella.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Prince Bahman, who, remembering the directions of the old woman,&#10;had been since sunrise on the look-out for some one, recognised the&#10;old man at once to be a dervish. He dismounted from his horse, and&#10;bowed low before the holy man, saying by way of greeting, &#34;My&#10;father, may your days be long in the land, and may all your wishes&#10;be fulfilled!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The dervish did his best to reply, but his moustache was so&#10;thick that his words were hardly intelligible, and the prince,&#10;perceiving what was the matter, took a pair of scissors from his&#10;saddle pockets, and requested permission to cut off some of the&#10;moustache, as he had a question of great importance to ask the&#10;dervish. The dervish made a sign that he might do as he liked, and&#10;when a few inches of his hair and beard had been pruned all round&#10;the prince assured the holy man that he would hardly believe how&#10;much younger he looked. The dervish smiled at his compliments, and&#10;thanked him for what he had done.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Let me,&#34; he said, &#34;show you my gratitude for making me more&#10;comfortable by telling me what I can do for you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Gentle dervish,&#34; replied Prince Bahman, &#34;I come from far, and I&#10;seek the Talking Bird, the Singing Tree, and the Golden Water. I&#10;know that they are to be found somewhere in these parts, but I am&#10;ignorant of the exact spot. Tell me, I pray you, if you can, so&#10;that I may not have travelled on a useless quest.&#34; While he was&#10;speaking, the prince observed a change in the countenance of the&#10;dervish, who waited for some time before he made reply.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My lord,&#34; he said at last, &#34;I do know the road for which you&#10;ask, but your kindness and the friendship I have conceived for you&#10;make me loth to point it out.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But why not?&#34; inquired the prince. &#34;What danger can there&#10;be?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The very greatest danger,&#34; answered the dervish. &#34;Other men, as&#10;brave as you, have ridden down this road, and have put me that&#10;question. I did my best to turn them also from their purpose, but&#10;it was of no use. Not one of them would listen to my words, and not&#10;one of them came back. Be warned in time, and seek to go no&#10;further.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I am grateful to you for your interest in me,&#34; said Prince&#10;Bahman, &#34;and for the advice you have given, though I cannot follow&#10;it. But what dangers can there be in the adventure which courage&#10;and a good sword cannot meet?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;And suppose,&#34; answered the dervish, &#34;that your enemies are&#10;invisible, how then?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Nothing will make me give it up,&#34; replied the prince, &#34;and for&#10;the last time I ask you to tell me where I am to go.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When the dervish saw that the prince&#39;s mind was made up, he drew&#10;a ball from a bag that lay near him, and held it out. &#34;If it must&#10;be so,&#34; he said, with a sigh, &#34;take this, and when you have mounted&#10;your horse throw the ball in front of you. It will roll on till it&#10;reaches the foot of a mountain, and when it stops you will stop&#10;also. You will then throw the bridle on your horse&#39;s neck without&#10;any fear of his straying, and will dismount. On each side you will&#10;see vast heaps of big black stones, and will hear a multitude of&#10;insulting voices, but pay no heed to them, and, above all, beware&#10;of ever turning your head. If you do, you will instantly become a&#10;black stone like the rest. For those stones are in reality men like&#10;yourself, who have been on the same quest, and have failed, as I&#10;fear that you may fail also. If you manage to avoid this pitfall,&#10;and to reach the top of the mountain, you will find there the&#10;Talking Bird in a splendid cage, and you can ask of him where you&#10;are to seek the Singing Tree and the Golden Water. That is all I&#10;have to say. You know what you have to do, and what to avoid, but&#10;if you are wise you will think of it no more, but return whence you&#10;have come.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The prince smilingly shook his head, and thanking the dervish&#10;once more, he sprang on his horse and threw the ball before&#10;him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The ball rolled along the road so fast that Prince Bahman had&#10;much difficulty in keeping up with it, and it never relaxed its&#10;speed till the foot of the mountain was reached. Then it came to a&#10;sudden halt, and the prince at once got down and flung the bridle&#10;on his horse&#39;s neck. He paused for a moment and looked round him at&#10;the masses of black stones with which the sides of the mountain&#10;were covered, and then began resolutely to ascend. He had hardly&#10;gone four steps when he heard the sound of voices around him,&#10;although not another creature was in sight.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Who is this imbecile?&#34; cried some, &#34;stop him at once.&#34; &#34;Kill&#10;him,&#34; shrieked others, &#34;Help! robbers! murderers! help! help!&#34; &#34;Oh,&#10;let him alone,&#34; sneered another, and this was the most trying of&#10;all, &#34;he is such a beautiful young man; I am sure the bird and the&#10;cage must have been kept for him.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At first the prince took no heed to all this clamour, but&#10;continued to press forward on his way. Unfortunately this conduct,&#10;instead of silencing the voices, only seemed to irritate them the&#10;more, and they arose with redoubled fury, in front as well as&#10;behind. After some time he grew bewildered, his knees began to&#10;tremble, and finding himself in the act of falling, he forgot&#10;altogether the advice of the dervish. He turned to fly down the&#10;mountain, and in one moment became a black stone.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As may be imagined, Prince Perviz and his sister were all this&#10;time in the greatest anxiety, and consulted the magic knife, not&#10;once but many times a day. Hitherto the blade had remained bright&#10;and spotless, but on the fatal hour on which Prince Bahman and his&#10;horse were changed into black stones, large drops of blood appeared&#10;on the surface. &#34;Ah! my beloved brother,&#34; cried the princess in&#10;horror, throwing the knife from her, &#34;I shall never see you again,&#10;and it is I who have killed you. Fool that I was to listen to the&#10;voice of that temptress, who probably was not speaking the truth.&#10;What are the Talking Bird and the Singing Tree to me in comparison&#10;with you, passionately though I long for them!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Prince Perviz&#39;s grief at his brother&#39;s loss was not less than&#10;that of Princess Parizade, but he did not waste his time on useless&#10;lamentations.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My sister,&#34; he said, &#34;why should you think the old woman was&#10;deceiving you about these treasures, and what would have been her&#10;object in doing so! No, no, our brother must have met his death by&#10;some accident, or want of precaution, and to-morrow I will start on&#10;the same quest.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Terrified at the thought that she might lose her only remaining&#10;brother, the princess entreated him to give up his project, but he&#10;remained firm. Before setting out, however, he gave her a chaplet&#10;of a hundred pearls, and said, &#34;When I am absent, tell this over&#10;daily for me. But if you should find that the beads stick, so that&#10;they will not slip one after the other, you will know that my&#10;brother&#39;s fate has befallen me. Still, we must hope for better&#10;luck.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then he departed, and on the twentieth day of his journey fell&#10;in with the dervish on the same spot as Prince Bahman had met him,&#10;and began to question him as to the place where the Talking Bird,&#10;the Singing Tree and the Golden Water were to be found. As in the&#10;case of his brother, the dervish tried to make him give up his&#10;project, and even told him that only a few weeks since a young man,&#10;bearing a strong resemblance to himself, had passed that way, but&#10;had never come back again.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;That, holy dervish,&#34; replied Prince Perviz, &#34;was my elder&#10;brother, who is now dead, though how he died I cannot say.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;He is changed into a black stone,&#34; answered the dervish, &#34;like&#10;all the rest who have gone on the same errand, and you will become&#10;one likewise if you are not more careful in following my&#10;directions.&#34; Then he charged the prince, as he valued his life, to&#10;take no heed of the clamour of voices that would pursue him up the&#10;mountain, and handing him a ball from the bag, which still seemed&#10;to be half full, he sent him on his way.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When Prince Perviz reached the foot of the mountain he jumped&#10;from his horse, and paused for a moment to recall the instructions&#10;the dervish had given him. Then he strode boldly on, but had&#10;scarcely gone five or six paces when he was startled by a man&#39;s&#10;voice that seemed close to his ear, exclaiming: &#34;Stop, rash fellow,&#10;and let me punish your audacity.&#34; This outrage entirely put the&#10;dervish&#39;s advice out of the prince&#39;s head. He drew his sword, and&#10;turned to avenge himself, but almost before he had realised that&#10;there was nobody there, he and his horse were two black stones.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Not a morning had passed since Prince Perviz had ridden away&#10;without Princess Parizade telling her beads, and at night she even&#10;hung them round her neck, so that if she woke she could assure&#10;herself at once of her brother&#39;s safety. She was in the very act of&#10;moving them through her fingers at the moment that the prince fell&#10;a victim to his impatience, and her heart sank when the first pearl&#10;remained fixed in its place. However she had long made up her mind&#10;what she would do in such a case, and the following morning the&#10;princess, disguised as a man, set out for the mountain.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As she had been accustomed to riding from her childhood, she&#10;managed to travel as many miles daily as her brothers had done, and&#10;it was, as before, on the twentieth day that she arrived at the&#10;place where the dervish was sitting. &#34;Good dervish,&#34; she said&#10;politely, &#34;will you allow me to rest by you for a few moments, and&#10;perhaps you will be so kind as to tell me if you have ever heard of&#10;a Talking Bird, a Singing Tree, and some Golden Water that are to&#10;be found somewhere near this?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Madam,&#34; replied the dervish, &#34;for in spite of your manly dress&#10;your voice betrays you, I shall be proud to serve you in any way I&#10;can. But may I ask the purpose of your question?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Good dervish,&#34; answered the princess, &#34;I have heard such&#10;glowing descriptions of these three things, that I cannot rest till&#10;I possess them.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Madam,&#34; said the dervish, &#34;they are far more beautiful than any&#10;description, but you seem ignorant of all the difficulties that&#10;stand in your way, or you would hardly have undertaken such an&#10;adventure. Give it up, I pray you, and return home, and do not ask&#10;me to help you to a cruel death.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Holy father,&#34; answered the princess, &#34;I come from far, and I&#10;should be in despair if I turned back without having attained my&#10;object. You have spoken of difficulties; tell me, I entreat you,&#10;what they are, so that I may know if I can overcome them, or see if&#10;they are beyond my strength.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So the dervish repeated his tale, and dwelt more firmly than&#10;before on the clamour of the voices, the horrors of the black&#10;stones, which were once living men, and the difficulties of&#10;climbing the mountain; and pointed out that the chief means of&#10;success was never to look behind till you had the cage in your&#10;grasp.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;As far as I can see,&#34; said the princess, &#34;the first thing is&#10;not to mind the tumult of the voices that follow you till you reach&#10;the cage, and then never to look behind. As to this, I think I have&#10;enough self-control to look straight before me; but as it is quite&#10;possible that I might be frightened by the voices, as even the&#10;boldest men have been, I will stop up my ears with cotton, so that,&#10;let them make as much noise as they like, I shall hear&#10;nothing.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Madam,&#34; cried the dervish, &#34;out of all the number who have&#10;asked me the way to the mountain, you are the first who has ever&#10;suggested such a means of escaping the danger! It is possible that&#10;you may succeed, but all the same, the risk is great.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Good dervish,&#34; answered the princess, &#34;I feel in my heart that&#10;I shall succeed, and it only remains for me to ask you the way I am&#10;to go.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then the dervish said that it was useless to say more, and he&#10;gave her the ball, which she flung before her.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The first thing the princess did on arriving at the mountain was&#10;to stop her ears with cotton, and then, making up her mind which&#10;was the best way to go, she began her ascent. In spite of the&#10;cotton, some echoes of the voices reached her ears, but not so as&#10;to trouble her. Indeed, though they grew louder and more insulting&#10;the higher she climbed, the princess only laughed, and said to&#10;herself that she certainly would not let a few rough words stand&#10;between her and the goal. At last she perceived in the distance the&#10;cage and the bird, whose voice joined itself in tones of thunder to&#10;those of the rest: &#34;Return, return! never dare to come near&#10;me.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At the sight of the bird, the princess hastened her steps, and&#10;without vexing herself at the noise which by this time had grown&#10;deafening, she walked straight up to the cage, and seizing it, she&#10;said: &#34;Now, my bird, I have got you, and I shall take good care&#10;that you do not escape.&#34; As she spoke she took the cotton from her&#10;ears, for it was needed no longer.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Brave lady,&#34; answered the bird, &#34;do not blame me for having&#10;joined my voice to those who did their best to preserve my freedom.&#10;Although confined in a cage, I was content with my lot, but if I&#10;must become a slave, I could not wish for a nobler mistress than&#10;one who has shown so much constancy, and from this moment I swear&#10;to serve you faithfully. Some day you will put me to the proof, for&#10;I know who you are better than you do yourself. Meanwhile, tell me&#10;what I can do, and I will obey you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Bird,&#34; replied the princess, who was filled with a joy that&#10;seemed strange to herself when she thought that the bird had cost&#10;her the lives of both her brothers. &#34;bird, let me first thank you&#10;for your good will, and then let me ask you where the Golden Water&#10;is to be found.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The bird described the place, which was not far distant, and the&#10;princess filled a small silver flask that she had brought with her&#10;for the purpose. She then returned to the cage, and said: &#34;Bird,&#10;there is still something else, where shall I find the Singing&#10;Tree?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Behind you, in that wood,&#34; replied the bird, and the princess&#10;wandered through the wood, till a sound of the sweetest voices told&#10;her she had found what she sought. But the tree was tall and&#10;strong, and it was hopeless to think of uprooting it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You need not do that,&#34; said the bird, when she had returned to&#10;ask counsel. &#34;Break off a twig, and plant it in your garden, and it&#10;will take root, and grow into a magnificent tree.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When the Princess Parizade held in her hands the three wonders&#10;promised her by the old woman, she said to the bird: &#34;All that is&#10;not enough. It was owing to you that my brothers became black&#10;stones. I cannot tell them from the mass of others, but you must&#10;know, and point them out to me, I beg you, for I wish to carry them&#10;away.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;For some reason that the princess could not guess these words&#10;seemed to displease the bird, and he did not answer. The princess&#10;waited a moment, and then continued in severe tones, &#34;Have you&#10;forgotten that you yourself said that you are my slave to do my&#10;bidding, and also that your life is in my power?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;No, I have not forgotten,&#34; replied the bird, &#34;but what you ask&#10;is very difficult. However, I will do my best. If you look round,&#34;&#10;he went on, &#34;you will see a pitcher standing near. Take it, and, as&#10;you go down the mountain, scatter a little of the water it contains&#10;over every black stone and you will soon find your two&#10;brothers.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Princess Parizade took the pitcher, and, carrying with her&#10;besides the cage the twig and the flask, returned down the mountain&#10;side. At every black stone she stopped and sprinkled it with water,&#10;and as the water touched it the stone instantly became a man. When&#10;she suddenly saw her brothers before her her delight was mixed with&#10;astonishment.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Why, what are you doing here?&#34; she cried.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;We have been asleep,&#34; they said.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Yes,&#34; returned the princess, &#34;but without me your sleep would&#10;probably have lasted till the day of judgment. Have you forgotten&#10;that you came here in search of the Talking Bird, the Singing Tree,&#10;and the Golden Water, and the black stones that were heaped up&#10;along the road? Look round and see if there is one left. These&#10;gentlemen, and yourselves, and all your horses were changed into&#10;these stones, and I have delivered you by sprinkling you with the&#10;water from this pitcher. As I could not return home without you,&#10;even though I had gained the prizes on which I had set my heart, I&#10;forced the Talking Bird to tell me how to break the spell.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;On hearing these words Prince Bahman and Prince Perviz&#10;understood all they owed their sister, and the knights who stood by&#10;declared themselves her slaves and ready to carry out her wishes.&#10;But the princess, while thanking them for their politeness,&#10;explained that she wished for no company but that of her brothers,&#10;and that the rest were free to go where they would.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So saying the princess mounted her horse, and, declining to&#10;allow even Prince Bahman to carry the cage with the Talking Bird,&#10;she entrusted him with the branch of the Singing Tree, while Prince&#10;Perviz took care of the flask containing the Golden Water.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Then they rode away, followed by the knights and gentlemen, who&#10;begged to be permitted to escort them.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It had been the intention of the party to stop and tell their&#10;adventures to the dervish, but they found to their sorrow that he&#10;was dead, whether from old age, or whether from the feeling that&#10;his task was done, they never knew.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As they continued their road their numbers grew daily smaller,&#10;for the knights turned off one by one to their own homes, and only&#10;the brothers and sister finally drew up at the gate of the&#10;palace.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The princess carried the cage straight into the garden, and, as&#10;soon as the bird began to sing, nightingales, larks, thrushes,&#10;finches, and all sorts of other birds mingled their voices in&#10;chorus. The branch she planted in a corner near the house, and in a&#10;few days it had grown into a great tree. As for the Golden Water it&#10;was poured into a great marble basin specially prepared for it, and&#10;it swelled and bubbled and then shot up into the air in a fountain&#10;twenty feet high.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The fame of these wonders soon spread abroad, and people came&#10;from far and near to see and admire.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;After a few days Prince Bahman and Prince Perviz fell back into&#10;their ordinary way of life, and passed most of their time hunting.&#10;One day it happened that the Sultan of Persia was also hunting in&#10;the same direction, and, not wishing to interfere with his sport,&#10;the young men, on hearing the noise of the hunt approaching,&#10;prepared to retire, but, as luck would have it, they turned into&#10;the very path down which the Sultan was coming. They threw&#10;themselves from their horses and prostrated themselves to the&#10;earth, but the Sultan was curious to see their faces, and commanded&#10;them to rise.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The princes stood up respectfully, but quite at their ease, and&#10;the Sultan looked at them for a few moments without speaking, then&#10;he asked who they were and where they lived.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Sire,&#34; replied Prince Bahman, &#34;we are sons of your Highness&#39;s&#10;late intendant of the gardens, and we live in a house that he built&#10;a short time before his death, waiting till an occasion should&#10;offer itself to serve your Highness.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You seem fond of hunting,&#34; answered the Sultan.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Sire,&#34; replied Prince Bahman, &#34;it is our usual exercise, and&#10;one that should be neglected by no man who expects to comply with&#10;the ancient customs of the kingdom and bear arms.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Sultan was delighted with this remark, and said at once, &#34;In&#10;that case I shall take great pleasure in watching you. Come, choose&#10;what sort of beasts you would like to hunt.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The princes jumped on their horses and followed the Sultan at a&#10;little distance. They had not gone very far before they saw a&#10;number of wild animals appear at once, and Prince Bahman started to&#10;give chase to a lion and Prince Perviz to a bear. Both used their&#10;javelins with such skill that, directly they arrived within&#10;striking range, the lion and the bear fell, pierced through and&#10;through. Then Prince Perviz pursued a lion and Prince Bahman a&#10;bear, and in a very few minutes they, too, lay dead. As they were&#10;making ready for a third assault the Sultan interfered, and,&#10;sending one of his officials to summon them, he said smiling, &#34;If I&#10;let you go on, there will soon be no beasts left to hunt. Besides,&#10;your courage and manners have so won my heart that I will not have&#10;you expose yourselves to further danger. I am convinced that some&#10;day or other I shall find you useful as well as agreeable.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;He then gave them a warm invitation to stay with him altogether,&#10;but with many thanks for the honour done them, they begged to be&#10;excused, and to be suffered to remain at home.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Sultan who was not accustomed to see his offers rejected&#10;inquired their reasons, and Prince Bahman explained that they did&#10;not wish to leave their sister, and were accustomed to do nothing&#10;without consulting all three together.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Ask her advice, then,&#34; replied the Sultan, &#34;and to-morrow come&#10;and hunt with me, and give me your answer.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The two princes returned home, but their adventure made so&#10;little impression on them that they quite forgot to speak to their&#10;sister on the subject. The next morning when they went to hunt they&#10;met the Sultan in the same place, and he inquired what advice their&#10;sister had given. The young men looked at each other and blushed.&#10;At last Prince Bahman said, &#34;Sire, we must throw ourselves on your&#10;Highness&#39;s mercy. Neither my brother nor myself remembered anything&#10;about it.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Then be sure you do not forget to-day,&#34; answered the Sultan,&#10;&#34;and bring me back your reply to-morrow.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When, however, the same thing happened a second time, they&#10;feared that the Sultan might be angry with them for their&#10;carelessness. But he took it in good part, and, drawing three&#10;little golden balls from his purse, he held them out to Prince&#10;Bahman, saying, &#34;Put these in your bosom and you will not forget a&#10;third time, for when you remove your girdle to-night the noise they&#10;will make in falling will remind you of my wishes.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;It all happened as the Sultan had foreseen, and the two brothers&#10;appeared in their sister&#39;s apartments just as she was in the act of&#10;stepping into bed, and told their tale.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Princess Parizade was much disturbed at the news, and did&#10;not conceal her feelings. &#34;Your meeting with the Sultan is very&#10;honourable to you,&#34; she said, &#34;and will, I dare say, be of service&#10;to you, but it places me in a very awkward position. It is on my&#10;account, I know, that you have resisted the Sultan&#39;s wishes, and I&#10;am very grateful to you for it. But kings do not like to have their&#10;offers refused, and in time he would bear a grudge against you,&#10;which would render me very unhappy. Consult the Talking Bird, who&#10;is wise and far-seeing, and let me hear what he says.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;So the bird was sent for and the case laid before him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The princes must on no account refuse the Sultan&#39;s proposal,&#34;&#10;said he, &#34;and they must even invite him to come and see your&#10;house.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;But, bird,&#34; objected the princess, &#34;you know how dearly we love&#10;each other; will not all this spoil our friendship?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Not at all,&#34; replied the bird, &#34;it will make it all the&#10;closer.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Then the Sultan will have to see me,&#34; said the princess.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The bird answered that it was necessary that he should see her,&#10;and everything would turn out for the best.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The following morning, when the Sultan inquired if they had&#10;spoken to their sister and what advice she had given them, Prince&#10;Bahman replied that they were ready to agree to his Highness&#39;s&#10;wishes, and that their sister had reproved them for their&#10;hesitation about the matter. The Sultan received their excuses with&#10;great kindness, and told them that he was sure they would be&#10;equally faithful to him, and kept them by his side for the rest of&#10;the day, to the vexation of the grand-vizir and the rest of the&#10;court.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When the procession entered in this order the gates of the&#10;capital, the eyes of the people who crowded the streets were fixed&#10;on the two young men, strangers to every one.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Oh, if only the Sultan had had sons like that!&#34; they murmured,&#10;&#34;they look so distinguished and are about the same age that his&#10;sons would have been!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Sultan commanded that splendid apartments should be prepared&#10;for the two brothers, and even insisted that they should sit at&#10;table with him. During dinner he led the conversation to various&#10;scientific subjects, and also to history, of which he was&#10;especially fond, but whatever topic they might be discussing he&#10;found that the views of the young men were always worth listening&#10;to. &#34;If they were my own sons,&#34; he said to himself, &#34;they could not&#10;be better educated!&#34; and aloud he complimented them on their&#10;learning and taste for knowledge.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;At the end of the evening the princes once more prostrated&#10;themselves before the throne and asked leave to return home; and&#10;then, encouraged by the gracious words of farewell uttered by the&#10;Sultan, Prince Bahman said: &#34;Sire, may we dare to take the liberty&#10;of asking whether you would do us and our sister the honour of&#10;resting for a few minutes at our house the first time the hunt&#10;passes that way?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;With the utmost pleasure,&#34; replied the Sultan; &#34;and as I am all&#10;impatience to see the sister of such accomplished young men you may&#10;expect me the day after to-morrow.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The princess was of course most anxious to entertain the Sultan&#10;in a fitting way, but as she had no experience in court customs she&#10;ran to the Talking Bird, and begged he would advise her as to what&#10;dishes should be served.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My dear mistress,&#34; replied the bird, &#34;your cooks are very good&#10;and you can safely leave all to them, except that you must be&#10;careful to have a dish of cucumbers, stuffed with pearl sauce,&#10;served with the first course.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Cucumbers stuffed with pearls!&#34; exclaimed the princess. &#34;Why,&#10;bird, who ever heard of such a dish? The Sultan will expect a&#10;dinner he can eat, and not one he can only admire! Besides, if I&#10;were to use all the pearls I possess, they would not be half&#10;enough.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Mistress,&#34; replied the bird, &#34;do what I tell you and nothing&#10;but good will come of it. And as to the pearls, if you go at dawn&#10;to-morrow and dig at the foot of the first tree in the park, on the&#10;right hand, you will find as many as you want.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The princess had faith in the bird, who generally proved to be&#10;right, and taking the gardener with her early next morning followed&#10;out his directions carefully. After digging for some time they came&#10;upon a golden box fastened with little clasps.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;These were easily undone, and the box was found to be full of&#10;pearls, not very large ones, but well-shaped and of a good colour.&#10;So leaving the gardener to fill up the hole he had made under the&#10;tree, the princess took up the box and returned to the house.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The two princes had seen her go out, and had wondered what could&#10;have made her rise so early. Full of curiosity they got up and&#10;dressed, and met their sister as she was returning with the box&#10;under her arm.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What have you been doing?&#34; they asked, &#34;and did the gardener&#10;come to tell you he had found a treasure?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;On the contrary,&#34; replied the princess, &#34;it is I who have found&#10;one,&#34; and opening the box she showed her astonished brothers the&#10;pearls inside. Then, on the way back to the palace, she told them&#10;of her consultation with the bird, and the advice it had given her.&#10;All three tried to guess the meaning of the singular counsel, but&#10;they were forced at last to admit the explanation was beyond them,&#10;and they must be content blindly to obey.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The first thing the princess did on entering the palace was to&#10;send for the head cook and to order the repast for the Sultan When&#10;she had finished she suddenly added, &#34;Besides the dishes I have&#10;mentioned there is one that you must prepare expressly for the&#10;Sultan, and that no one must touch but yourself. It consists of a&#10;stuffed cucumber, and the stuffing is to be made of these&#10;pearls.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The head cook, who had never in all his experience heard of such&#10;a dish, stepped back in amazement.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;You think I am mad,&#34; answered the princess, who perceived what&#10;was in his mind. &#34;But I know quite well what I am doing. Go, and do&#10;your best, and take the pearls with you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The next morning the princes started for the forest, and were&#10;soon joined by the Sultan. The hunt began and continued till&#10;mid-day, when the heat became so great that they were obliged to&#10;leave off. Then, as arranged, they turned their horses&#39; heads&#10;towards the palace, and while Prince Bahman remained by the side of&#10;the Sultan, Prince Perviz rode on to warn his sister of their&#10;approach.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The moment his Highness entered the courtyard, the princess&#10;flung herself at his feet, but he bent and raised her, and gazed at&#10;her for some time, struck with her grace and beauty, and also with&#10;the indefinable air of courts that seemed to hang round this&#10;country girl. &#34;They are all worthy one of the other,&#34; he said to&#10;himself, &#34;and I am not surprised that they think so much of her&#10;opinions. I must know more of them.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;By this time the princess had recovered from the first&#10;embarrassment of meeting, and proceeded to make her speech of&#10;welcome.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;This is only a simple country house, sire,&#34; she said, &#34;suitable&#10;to people like ourselves, who live a quiet life. It cannot compare&#10;with the great city mansions, much less, of course, with the&#10;smallest of the Sultan&#39;s palaces.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I cannot quite agree with you,&#34; he replied; &#34;even the little&#10;that I have seen I admire greatly, and I will reserve my judgment&#10;until you have shown me the whole.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The princess then led the way from room to room, and the Sultan&#10;examined everything carefully. &#34;Do you call this a simple country&#10;house?&#34; he said at last. &#34;Why, if every country house was like&#10;this, the towns would soon be deserted. I am no longer astonished&#10;that you do not wish to leave it. Let us go into the gardens, which&#10;I am sure are no less beautiful than the rooms.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;A small door opened straight into the garden, and the first&#10;object that met the Sultan&#39;s eyes was the Golden Water.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;What lovely coloured water!&#34; he exclaimed; &#34;where is the&#10;spring, and how do you make the fountain rise so high? I do not&#10;believe there is anything like it in the world.&#34; He went forward to&#10;examine it, and when he had satisfied his curiosity, the princess&#10;conducted him towards the Singing Tree.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;As they drew near, the Sultan was startled by the sound of&#10;strange voices, but could see nothing. &#34;Where have you hidden your&#10;musicians?&#34; he asked the princess; &#34;are they up in the air, or&#10;under the earth? Surely the owners of such charming voices ought&#10;not to conceal themselves!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Sire,&#34; answered the princess, &#34;the voices all come from the&#10;tree which is straight in front of us; and if you will deign to&#10;advance a few steps, you will see that they become clearer.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Sultan did as he was told, and was so wrapt in delight at&#10;what he heard that he stood some time in silence.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Tell me, madam, I pray you,&#34; he said at last, &#34;how this&#10;marvellous tree came into your garden? It must have been brought&#10;from a great distance, or else, fond as I am of all curiosities, I&#10;could not have missed hearing of it! What is its name?&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The only name it has, sire,&#34; replied she, &#34;is the Singing Tree,&#10;and it is not a native of this country. Its history is mixed up&#10;with those of the Golden Water and the Talking Bird, which you have&#10;not yet seen. If your Highness wishes I will tell you the whole&#10;story, when you have recovered from your fatigue.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Indeed, madam,&#34; returned he, &#34;you show me so many wonders that&#10;it is impossible to feel any fatigue. Let us go once more and look&#10;at the Golden Water; and I am dying to see the Talking Bird.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Sultan could hardly tear himself away from the Golden Water,&#10;which puzzled him more and more. &#34;You say,&#34; he observed to the&#10;princess, &#34;that this water does not come from any spring, neither&#10;is brought by pipes. All I understand is, that neither it nor the&#10;Singing Tree is a native of this country.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;It is as you say, sire,&#34; answered the princess, &#34;and if you&#10;examine the basin, you will see that it is all in one piece, and&#10;therefore the water could not have been brought through it. What is&#10;more astonishing is, that I only emptied a small flaskful into the&#10;basin, and it increased to the quantity you now see.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Well, I will look at it no more to-day,&#34; said the Sultan. &#34;Take&#10;me to the Talking Bird.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;On approaching the house, the Sultan noticed a vast quantity of&#10;birds, whose voices filled the air, and he inquired why they were&#10;so much more numerous here than in any other part of the&#10;garden.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Sire,&#34; answered the princess, &#34;do you see that cage hanging in&#10;one of the windows of the saloon? that is the Talking Bird, whose&#10;voice you can hear above them all, even above that of the&#10;nightingale. And the birds crowd to this spot, to add their songs&#10;to his.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Sultan stepped through the window, but the bird took no&#10;notice, continuing his song as before.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;My slave,&#34; said the princess, &#34;this is the Sultan; make him a&#10;pretty speech.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The bird stopped singing at once, and all the other birds&#10;stopped too.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The Sultan is welcome,&#34; he said. &#34;I wish him long life and all&#10;prosperity.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I thank you, good bird,&#34; answered the Sultan, seating himself&#10;before the repast, which was spread at a table near the window,&#10;&#34;and I am enchanted to see in you the Sultan and King of the&#10;Birds.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Sultan, noticing that his favourite dish of cucumber was&#10;placed before him, proceeded to help himself to it, and was amazed&#10;to and that the stuffing was of pearls. &#34;A novelty, indeed!&#34; cried&#10;he, &#34;but I do not understand the reason of it; one cannot eat&#10;pearls!&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;Sire,&#34; replied the bird, before either the princes or the&#10;princess could speak, &#34;surely your Highness cannot be so surprised&#10;at beholding a cucumber stuffed with pearls, when you believed&#10;without any difficulty that the Sultana had presented you, instead&#10;of children, with a dog, a cat, and a log of wood.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;I believed it,&#34; answered the Sultan, &#34;because the women&#10;attending on her told me so.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;&#34;The women, sire,&#34; said the bird, &#34;were the sisters of the&#10;Sultana, who were devoured with jealousy at the honour you had done&#10;her, and in order to revenge themselves invented this story. Have&#10;them examined, and they will confess their crime. These are your&#10;children, who were saved from death by the intendant of your&#10;gardens, and brought up by him as if they were his own.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Like a flash the truth came to the mind of the Sultan. &#34;Bird,&#34;&#10;he cried, &#34;my heart tells me that what you say is true. My&#10;children,&#34; he added, &#34;let me embrace you, and embrace each other,&#10;not only as brothers and sister, but as having in you the blood&#10;royal of Persia which could flow in no nobler veins.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;When the first moments of emotion were over, the Sultan hastened&#10;to finish his repast, and then turning to his children he&#10;exclaimed: &#34;To-day you have made acquaintance with your father.&#10;To-morrow I will bring you the Sultana your mother. Be ready to&#10;receive her.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;The Sultan then mounted his horse and rode quickly back to the&#10;capital. Without an instant&#39;s delay he sent for the grand-vizir,&#10;and ordered him to seize and question the Sultana&#39;s sisters that&#10;very day. This was done. They were confronted with each other and&#10;proved guilty, and were executed in less than an hour.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;But the Sultan did not wait to hear that his orders had been&#10;carried out before going on foot, followed by his whole court to&#10;the door of the great mosque, and drawing the Sultana with his own&#10;hand out of the narrow prison where she had spent so many years,&#10;&#34;Madam,&#34; he cried, embracing her with tears in his eyes, &#34;I have&#10;come to ask your pardon for the injustice I have done you, and to&#10;repair it as far as I may. I have already begun by punishing the&#10;authors of this abominable crime, and I hope you will forgive me&#10;when I introduce you to our children, who are the most charming and&#10;accomplished creatures in the whole world. Come with me, and take&#10;back your position and all the honour that is due to you.&#34;&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;This speech was delivered in the presence of a vast multitude of&#10;people, who had gathered from all parts on the first hint of what&#10;was happening, and the news was passed from mouth to mouth in a few&#10;seconds.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;Early next day the Sultan and Sultana, dressed in robes of state&#10;and followed by all the court, set out for the country house of&#10;their children. Here the Sultan presented them to the Sultana one&#10;by one, and for some time there was nothing but embraces and tears&#10;and tender words. Then they ate of the magnificent dinner which had&#10;been prepared for them, and after they were all refreshed they went&#10;into the garden, where the Sultan pointed out to his wife the&#10;Golden Water and the Singing Tree. As to the Talking Bird, she had&#10;already made acquaintance with him.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;In the evening they rode together back to the capital, the&#10;princes on each side of their father, and the princess with her&#10;mother. Long before they reached the gates the way was lined with&#10;people, and the air filled with shouts of welcome, with which were&#10;mingled the songs of the Talking Bird, sitting in its cage on the&#10;lap of the princess, and of the birds who followed it.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;&#60;p&#62;And in this manner they came back to their father&#39;s palace.&#60;/p&#62;&#10;'), :author_id => 3, :source => 'http://www.feedbooks.com/book/208', :deleted => 0)
