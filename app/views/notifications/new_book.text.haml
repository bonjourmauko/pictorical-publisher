  As this is your first illustrated book with Pictorical, we want to teach you how to make awesome books with us.

  That’s why we are asking you initially to do only one illustration for
  = @book.title
  , using our Artwork Guidelines. We will then check that everything’s fine, and then you can continue illustrating it.

  We will keep the book
  = @book.title
  reserved for you for two weeks. If you haven’t sent your first illustration by
  = @expiration
  , then we will make the book available for another artist to illustrate it.

- else

  You can now start illustrating this story. Please remember to follow our Artwork Guidelines carefully, as they are very important for keeping the quality of our books awesome.

  You can start illustrating the story right now. Please keep us updated on your work. We will send you friendly reminders each week or so, just to ask how you’re doing and see if you have any questions.

Feel free to contact us at artists@pictorical.com and tell us your progress and ask questions.

Thanks, and happy illustrating!

The Pictorical Team
