  As this is your first illustrated book with Pictorical, we want to teach you how to make awesome books with us.

  That's why we are asking you to do only one illustration for
  = @book.title
  using our Artwork Guidelines. We will then check everything's fine and then you can continue illustrating it.

  We will keep the book
  = @book.title
  reserved for you for two weeks. If you haven't sent your first illustration before
  = @expiration
  then we will make the book available for other artist to illustrate it.

- else

  You can now start illustrating this story. Please remember to follow our
  = link_to "Artwork Guidelines", artwork_guidelines_path
  carefully, as they are very important for keeping the quality of our books awesome.

  You can start illustrating the story right now. Please, keep us updated on your work. We will send you friendly reminders each week or so, just to ask how youâ€™re doing and see if you have any questions.

Feel free to write us to
