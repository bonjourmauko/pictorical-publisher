  %p As this is your first illustrated book with Pictorical, we want to teach you how to make awesome books with us.

  %p= "That's why we are asking you to do only one illustration for #{@book.text[:title]} using our Artwork Guidelines. We will then check everything's fine and then you can continue illustrating it."

  %p= "We will keep the book #{@book.text[:title]} reserved for you for two weeks. If you haven't sent your first illustration before #{@expiration} then we will make the book available for other artist to illustrate it."

- else

  %p You can now start illustrating this story. Please remember to follow our Artwork Guidelines carefully, as they are very important for keeping the quality of our books awesome.

  %p You can start illustrating the story right now. Please, keep us updated on your work. We will send you friendly reminders each week or so, just to ask how youâ€™re doing and see if you have any questions.
