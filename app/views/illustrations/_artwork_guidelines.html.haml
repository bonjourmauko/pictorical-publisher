%a{:name => "technique"}
%h2 Technique
%p
  We like
  %b hand-made illustrations
  that look made by humans, not computers.
%p A little bit of Photoshop is fine.

%a{:name => "formats"}
%h2 Transparency and File Formats
%p
  You must save
  %b story illustrations
  and
  %b decorated first capitals
  as PNG with unused areas transparent. Choose “Interlace none” if asked.

%p
  Tip: There are many tutorials in the web on how to make transparent PNGs,

  An illustration with transparency in the unused areas looks like this in Photoshop
%p
  %b Cover illustrations
  must be saved as JPG with the maximum quality (Quality 12 in Photoshop). Choose “Baseline/Standard” if asked.

%a{:name => "tips"}
%h2 Tips
%p
  For the illustrations in a book to have the same look and feel, please use:
  .item.half.indented The same style for all illustrations in a book
  .item.half.indented The same materials (paper, pencils, brushes, etc)
  .item.half.indented The same scanner, software and color correction
  .item.half.indented The same page or canvas width to keep the same line weights.

%p Do not to include text in the illustrations, as these are automatically resized and can become too small to read.

%p Try to have the illustrations evenly spaced in the text. For example, avoid having too many illustrations at the end of the story and too few at the beginning.

%p People who buy e-books in the iBookstore can download a free preview of the first pages of your book. So don't forget to include illustrations in the beggining of the text!
